It also makes clear the need for some means of ensur-\ning that the spiritual legacy he left not be diluted, fragmented, or \ndistorted with the passing of time. \nWith the increasing variety of sources of information about \nParamahansa Yogananda, readers sometimes inquire how they can \nbe certain that a publication accurately presents his life and teach-\nings. In response to these inquiries, we would like to explain that \nParamahansaji founded Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-\nRealization Fellowship to disseminate his teachings and to pre-\nserve their purity and integrity for future generations. He \npersonally chose and trained those close disciples who head the \nYogoda Satsanga Society/Self-Realization Fellowship Publications \nCouncil, and gave them specific guidelines for the preparation and \npublishing of his lectures, writings, and Yogoda Satsanga Lessons. \nThe members of the YSS/SRF Publications Council honour these \nguidelines as a sacred trust, in order that the universal message of \nthis beloved world teacher may live on in its original power and \nauthenticity. \nThe Yogoda Satsanga Society of India /Self-Realization \nFellowship name and the YSS/SRF emblem (shown above) were \noriginated by Paramahansaji to identify the organization he \nfounded to carry on his worldwide spiritual and humanitarian \nwork. These appear on all YSS/SRF books, audio and video record-\nings, films, and other publications, assuring the reader that a work \noriginates with the organization founded by Sri Sri Paramahansa \nYogananda and faithfully conveys his teachings as he himself \nintended they be given. \nYOGODA SATSANGA SOCIETY OF \nINDIA / SELF-REALIZATION FELLOWSHIP \n"}

The year was 1931. As I stood at the back of the crowded \nauditorium, I became transfixed, unaware of anything around \nme except the speaker and his words. My whole being was ab-\nsorbed in the wisdom and divine love that were pouring into \nmy soul and flooding my heart and mind. I could only think, \n\"This man loves God as I have always longed to love Him. He \nknows God. Him I shall follow.\" And from that moment, I did. \nAs I felt the transfiguring power of his words on my own life \nduring those early days with Paramahansaji, there arose within \nme a feeling of the urgent need to preserve his words for all the \nworld, for all time. It became my sacred and joyous privilege, \nduring the many years I was with Paramahansa Yogananda, to \nrecord his lectures and classes, and also many informal talks \nand words of personal counsel—truly a vast treasure-house of \nwondrous wisdom and God-love. As Gurudeva spoke, the rush \nof his inspiration was often reflected in the swiftness of his \nspeech; he might speak without pause for minutes at a time, \nand continue for an hour. While his hearers sat enthralled, my \npen was flying! As I took down his words in shorthand, it was \nas though a special grace had descended, instantly translating \nthe Guru's voice into the shorthand characters on the page. \nTheir transcription has been a blessed task that continues to \nthis day. Even after such a long time—some of my notes are \nmore than forty years old—when I start to transcribe them, \nthey are miraculously fresh in my mind, as though they had \nbeen recoreded yesterday. I can even hear inwardly the inflec-\ntions of Gurudeva's voice in each particular phrase. \n[ x i ] \ni \n"}

Very often, while rid-\ning in the car on the way to the temple, he would casually ask \none of us: \"What is my subject today?\" He would put his mind \non it, and then give the lecture extemporaneously from an inner \nreservoir of divine inspiration. \nThe subjects for Gurudeva's sermons at the temples were \nset and announced in advance. But sometimes his mind was \nworking in an entirely different vein when he began to speak. \nRegardless of the \"subject for today,\" the Master would voice \nthe truths engrossing his consciousness at that moment, pour-\ning forth priceless wisdom in a steady stream from the abun-\ndance of his own spiritual experience and intuitive perception. \nNearly always, at the close of such a service, a number of peo-\nple would come forward to thank him for having enlightened \nthem on a problem that had been troubling them, or perhaps \nfor having explained some philosophical concept in which they \nwere parcticularly interested. \nSometimes, while he was lecturing, the Guru's conscious-\nness would be so uplifted that he would momentarily forget the \naudience and converse directly with God; his whole being would \nbe overflowing with divine joy and intoxicating love. In these \nhigh states of consciousness, his mind completely at one with \nthe Divine Consciousness, he inwardly perceived Truth, and de-\nscribed what he saw. On occasion, God appeared to him as the \nDivine Mother, or in some other aspect; or one of our great Gu-\nrus, or other saints, would manifest in vision before him. At \nsuch times, even the audience would feel deeply the special \nblessing bestowed on all present. During such a visitation of \nSaint Francis of Assisi, whom Gurudeva deeply loved, the Mas-\nter was inspired to compose the beautiful poem, \"God! God! \nGod!\" \nThe Bhagavad Gita describes an enlightened master in these \nwords: \"The Self shines forth like a sun in those who have ban-\nished ignorance by wisdom\" (V:16). One might have been over-\nawed by Paramahansa Yogananda's spiritual radiance, were it \nnot for his warmth and naturalness, and a quiet humility, which \nput everyone instantly at ease.

But it is my humble hope, in giving this brief background, \nto afford a personal glimpse that will enrich the reader's enjoy-\nment and appreciation of the talks presented in this volume. \nTo have seen my Gurudeva in divine communion; to have \nheard the profound truths and devotional outpourings of his \nsoul; to have recorded them for the ages,- and now to share them \nwith all—what joy is mine!

For those individual souls \nwho have sought and found God, the search is over: \nHe is that something Else. \n—Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda \nThis volume of talks by Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda is for \nall who have ever known disappointment, dissatisfaction, dis-\ncouragement, sorrow, or an unfulfilled spiritual longing. It is for \nthose who have sought to understand the enigmas of life; for \nthose who have held within their hearts an uncertain hope about \nthe reality of God and the possibility that He could be known; \nand for seekers who have already turned toward God in their \nquest. May it be, for each reader, a ray of divine light on the path, \nbringing new life and inspiritation and a sense of direction. God \nis all things to all people. \nMan's Eternal Quest is a book about God: about God's place \nin man's life; in his hopes, will, aspirations, accomplishments. \nLife, man, achievement—all are but manifestations of the one \nomnipresent Creator, as inseparably dependent on Him as the \nwave is dependent on the ocean. Paramahansaji explains why \nand how man was created by God, and how he is immutably a \npart of God, and what this means to each one personally. Real-\nization of the oneness of man and his Creator is the whole \nessence of Yoga. An understanding of man's inescapable need for \nGod, in every aspect of living, removes the otherworldliness \nfrom religion and makes knowing God the basis of a scientific \nand practical approach to life. \nAs man of God, and as an authority on the ancient divine \nscience of Yoga, Paramahansa Yogananda has received the highest \ncredentials from his spiritual contemporaries, and from readers of \nhis works in all parts of the world—the literary and general pub-\nlic as well as his followers. That he has also received the ultimate \n[xiv] \n"}

This comment in Review \nof Religions, published by Columbia University Press, is typical of \nthe acclaim received by Paramahansa Yogananda's earlier work, \nAutobiography of a Yogi: \"There has been nothing before, written \nin English or in any other European language, like this presenta-\ntion of Yoga.\" The San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \"Yogananda \npresents a convincing case for yoga, and those who 'came to scoff' \nmay remain to pray.\" From Schleswig-Holsteinische Tagespost, \nGermany: \"We must credit this book with the power to bring \nabout a spiritual revolution.\" Of Paramahansa Yogananda himself, \nSwami Sivananda, founder of the Divine Life Society, Rishikesh, \nsaid: \"A rare gem of inestimable value, the like of whom the world \nis yet to witness, Paramahansa Yogananda has been an ideal rep-\nresentative of the ancient sages and seers, the glory of India.\" His \nHoliness the Shankaracharya of Kanchipuram, revered spiritual \nleader of millions in South India, wrote of Paramahansaji: \"As a \nbright light shining in the midst of darkness, so was Yogananda's \npresence in this world. Such a great soul comes on earth only \nrarely, when there is a real need among men. We are grateful to \nYogananda for spreading Hindu philosophy in such a wonderful \nway in America and the West.\" \nSri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda was born in Gorakhpur, Uttar \nPradesh, on January 5, 1893. He had a remarkable childhood that \nclearly indicated his life was marked for a divine destiny. His \nmother recognized this and encouraged his noble ideals and spiri-\ntual aspirations. When he was only eleven, the loss of his mother, \nwhom he loved above all else in this world, made firm his inher-\nent resolve to find God and to receive from the Creator Himself \nthe answers yearned for in every human heart. He became a dis-\nciple of the great fnanavatar (incarnation of wisdom) Sri Sri \nSwami Sri Yukteswar Giri. Sri Yukteswarji was one of a line of ex-\nalted gurus, with whom Yoganandaji had been linked from birth: \nSri Yogananda's parents were disciples of Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasaya, \nguru of Sri Yukteswarji. When Yoganandaji was an infant in his \nmother's arms, Lahiri Mahasaya had blessed him and foretold: \n\"Little mother, thy son will be a yogi. As a spiritual engine, he \n"}

Praised by \nBhagavan Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, and by Patanjali in the \nYoga Sutras, Kriya Yoga is both a transcendent technique of med-\nitation and an art of living that leads to union of the soul with \nGod. Mahavatar Babaji revealed the sacred Kriya to Lahiri Ma-\nhasaya, who handed it down to Sri Yukteswarji, who taught it to \nParamahansa Yogananda. \nWhen in 1920 Paramahansa Yogananda was deemed ready to \nbegin his world mission of disseminating the soul-liberating \nscience of Yoga, Mahavatar Babaji told him of the divine respon-\nsibility that was to be his: \"You are the one I have chosen to \nspread the message of Kriya Yoga in the West. Long ago I met your \nguru Yukteswar at a Kumbha Mela-, I told him then I would send \nyou to him for training. Kriya Yoga, the scientific technique of \nGod-realization, will ultimately spread in all lands, and aid in \nharmonizing the nations through man's personal, transcendental \nperception of the Infinite Father.\" \nParamahansa Yogananda began his mission in America as a \ndelegate to the International Congress of Religious Liberals in \nBoston in 1920. For more than a decade he travelled the length and \nbreadth of America, speaking almost daily to capacity audiences \nin all the major cities. On January 28, 1925, the Los Angeles Times \nreported: \"The Philharmonic Auditorium presents the extraordi-\nnary spectacle of thousands... being turned away an hour before \nthe advertised opening of a lecture with the 3000-seat hall filled \nto its utmost capacity. Swami Yogananda is the attraction. A \nHindu invading the United States to bring God.... It came as no \nsmall revelation to the West that Yoga—so eloquently expounded \nand clearly interpreted by Sri Yogananda—is a universal science, \nand that as such it is the essence of all true religions. \nIn Los Angeles in 1925, Paramahansa Yogananda founded the \ninternational headquarters for Self-Realization Fellowship, the \nsociety he had started in India in 1917 as Yogoda Satsanga Society \nof India. \nIn the late 1930s Paramahansaji began to withdraw gradually \nfrom nationwide public lecturing. \"I am not interested in crowds,\" \n"}

The selections in this volume \nare talks given primarily during this period. \nParamahansa Yogananda had often voiced this prediction: \"I \nwill not die in bed, but with my boots on, speaking of God and \nIndia.\" On March 7, 1952, the prophecy was fulfilled. At a banquet \nin honour of the Ambassador of India, B. R. Sen, Paramahansaji \nwas a guest speaker. He delivered a soul-stirring address, conclud-\ning with these words from a poem he had written, \"My India\": \n\"Where Ganges, woods, Himalayan caves and men dream God— \nI am hallowed; my body touched that sod!\" He then lifted his eyes \nupward and entered mahasamadhi, an advanced yogi's conscious \nearth-exit. He died as he had lived, exhorting man to know God. \nThe Guru's talks in the earliest years of his ministry were \nrecorded only spasmodically. But when Sri Sri Daya Mata became \na disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda in 1931, she undertook the \nsacred task, faithfully recording, for the generations to come, all \nof her Guru's talks and classes. This volume is but a sampling: un-\nder the direction of Paramahansa Yogananda, many transcriptions \n—particularly those containing private instruction and meditation \ntechniques and principles given to Yogoda Satsanga/Self-Realiza-\ntion class students—were compiled along with some of his writ-\nings into a series of Yogoda Satsanga Lessons; other talks appear \nas a regular feature in Yogoda Satsanga annual-series booklets. \nSecond and third anthologies, The Divine Romance and Journey \nto Self-Realization, are companion volumes to Man's Eternal \nQuest. \nAs most of the talks set forth in this book were presented \nbefore audiences familiar with Yogoda Satsanga/Self-Realization \nteachings, some clarification of terminology and philosophical \nconcepts may be helpful to the general reader. To this end,, many \nfootnotes have been included; also a glossary explaining certain \nSanskrit words, and other philosophical terms, and giving infor-\nmation about events, persons, and places associated with the life \nand work of Paramahansa Yogananda.

In talks \nwhere he was rendering a Gita passage more freely in order to \nemphasize a specific point, the paraphrase has been retained and \nnoted as such in the footnote citation. \nSri Sri Parmahansa Yogananda could have said, with Jesus, \n\"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I \nam not come to destroy, but to fulfill\" (Matthew 5:17). Parama-\nhansaji honoured all religions ajjd their founders, and held in \nrespect all sincere seekers of God. Part of his world mission is \"to \nreveal the complete harmony and basic oneness of original Yoga \nas taught by Bhagawan Krishna and original Christianity as taught \nby Jesus Christ.'^(See Aims and Ideals, Page 465.) Far from intro-\nducing a divisive dogma to the world, Paramahansaji showed that \nthe practice of yoga establishes an inner attunement with God \nthat constitutes the universal basis of all religions. Abstractions \nof theoretical religion pale before actual experience of God. Truth \ncannot be wholly proved to any seeker by anyone else; but by the \npractice of yoga, the aspirant can prove truth for himself through \nhis own experience. \nGod is; and each man who will seek Him sincerely will know \nHim. Man can have no life or power to act, think, or feel without \nborrowing that power from God. Therefore, Paramahansaji pointed \nout, knowing God is not only a privilege and a divine duty, but a \npractical necessity.

He suffered physically and therefore sought a \nmethod to heal himself. But how did man happen to try to find \nout about God? The question gives scope for profound reflection. \nIn the Vedas* of India we find the earliest true concept of \nGod- In her scriptures India has given the world immortal \ntruths that have stood the test of time. \nEvery material inventor is actuated by material need— \n\"necessity is the mother of invention.\" Similarly motivated by \nnecessity, the early rishist of India became ardent spiritual \nseekers. They had found that without inner satisfaction, no \namount of external good fortune can bring lasting happiness. \nHow then can one make himself really happy? That is the \nproblem the wise men of India undertook to solve. \nThree Aspects of Nature \nWorship of God in prehistoric times began through man's \nfear of the various forces of nature. When it rained excessively, \nfloods killed many people. Awed, man thought of the rain and \nwind and other natural forces as gods. \nLater on, human beings realized that nature operates in \nthree ways: creative, preservative, and dissolutive. A wave \n* From the Sanskrit vid, \"to know.\" The Vedas comprise a voluminous scrip-\nture of 100,000 couplets. The origin of the Vedas is lost in antiquity. They \nwere passed down orally for millenniums. According to tradition, the illu-\nmined sage Vyasa, who lived at the time of Bhagavan Krishna (see glossary), \nwas the compiler and arranger of the Vedas in their present form: Rig Veda, \nSama Veda, Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda. \nt Literally \"seers.\" The rishis were the inspired personages to whom the Vedas \nwere revealed in an indeterminable antiquity. \n3 \n"}

($he sages of old named them Brahma the Creator, \nVishnu the Preserver, and Shiva the Destroyed These primal \npowers were created as projections of the unmanifested Spirit \nto unfold His infinite drama of creation, while He, as God be-\nyond creation, remains ever hidden behind their consciousness. \nIn times of cosmic dissolution, all creation and its vast activat-\ning forces dissolve back into Spirit. There they rest until called \nupon again by the Great Director to reenact their roles. * \n/ r / c&o \nA Story About Brahma. Vishnu. And Shiva \nIn India there is a popular story about Brahma, Vishnu, and \nShiva. They were boasting among themselves about their \ntremendous might. Suddenly a little boy came up and said to \nBrahma, \"What do you create?\" \"Everything,\" Brahma replied \ngrandly. The boy asked the other two gods what their work \nwas. \"We preserve and destroy everything,\" they answered. \nThe young visitor was holding in his hand a single piece of \nstraw about the size of a toothpick. Placing it in front of \nBrahma, he asked, \"Can you create a piece of straw like this?\" \nAfter prodigious effort, Brahma found to his astonishment that \nhe cound not. The lad then turned to Vishnu and asked him to \nsave the straw, which was slowly starting to dissolve under the \nboy's steady gaze. Vishnu's efforts to hold it together were \nfruitless. Finally, the little stranger produced the piece of straw \nagain and asked Shiva to destroy it. But try as Shiva would to \nannihilate it, the tiny straw remained intact. \nThe little boy turned again to Brahma: \"Did you create \n* \"They are true knowers.. .who understand the Day of Brahma, which endures \nfor a thousand cycles (yugas), and the Night of Brahma, which also endures for \na thousand cycles.

Brahma thought and thought; he could not \nremember ever having created this amazing child. Suddenly \nthe boy vanished. The three gods awoke from their delusion \nand remembered that behind their power is a Greater Power. \nGod, the Supreme Cause \nIn the Western world the idea of God developed through \nobservation of the law of cause and effect. Man can material-\nize objects by taking materials from the earth and shaping \nthem in accordance with a preconceived idea; therefore it \nseemed reasonable to conclude that this whole universe must \nhave been created out of ideas. This led to the concept that \neverything must have existed first as an idea. Someone had to \ncreate that first idea or cosmic plan. Thus through the analogy \nof the law of cause and effect, intelligent men reasoned that \nthere must be a Supreme Cause. \nScience has learned that all matter is made of invisible \nbuilding blocks—electrons and protons—just as a house is \nbuilt of bricks. But nobody can tell why some electrons and \nprotons become wood, and others become human bone, and so \non. What Intelligence guides them? This line of questioning \ngives room for God in even the material scientist's theories \nabout the nature of the phenomenal worlds. The sages of India \nsay that everything proceeds from and goes back into its \nsource: God. \nEvidence of Order and Harmony Is Everywhere \nPerceiving that every human being is a compound of mat-\nter and mind, the earliest Western thinkers believed that two \nindependent forces existed: nature and mind. Later they began \nasking themselves, \"Why is everything in nature arranged in a \nparticular way? Why isn't one of man's arms longer than the \nother? Why don't stars and planets collide? Everywhere we see \nevidence of order and harmony in the universe.\" They con-\ncluded that mind and matter could not be both separate and \nsovereign; a single Intelligence must govern all. This conclu-\nsion naturally led to the idea that there is just one God, who is \nboth the Cause of matter and the Intelligence within and be-\nhind it.

Then the question is, how did seekers first find Him? \nAs the beginning step, they closed their eyes to shut out \nimmediate contact with the world and matter, so they could \nconcentrate more fully on discovering the Intelligence behind \nit. They reasoned that they could not behold God's presence in \nnature through the ordinary perceptions of the five senses. So \nthey began to try to feel Him within themselves by deeper and \ndeeper concentration. They eventually discovered how to shut \noff all five senses, thus temporarily doing away entirely with \nthe consciousness of matter. The inner world of the Spirit \nbegan to open up* To those great ones of ancient India who un-\ndeviatingly persisted in these inner investigations, God finally \nrevealed Himself. \nDevotion and Right Activity Attract God's Attention \nThus the saints gradually began to convert their concep-\ntions of God into perceptions of Him. That is what you must \ndo also, if you would know Him. You don't stay long enough \nat your prayers. First you must have a right concept of God— \na definite idea through which you can form a relationship with \nHim—and then you must meditatet and pray until that men-\ntal conception becomes changed into actual perception. Then \nyou will know Him. If you persist, the Lord will come. The \nSearcher of Hearts wants only your sincere love. He is like a \nlittle child: someone may offer Him his whole wealth and He \ndoesn't want it; and another cries to Him, \"O Lord, I love You!\" \nand into that devotee's heart He comes running. \nDon't seek God with any ulterior motive, but pray to Him \nwith devotion—unconditional, one-pointed, steady devotion. \nWhen your love for Him is as great as your attachment to your \nmortal body, He will come to you. \nIn seeking the Lord, activity comes after devotion in \nimportance. Some say, \"God is Power,- therefore let us act with \n*J\"..Aoi, \nbehold, the kingdom of God is within you\" (Luke 17:21, Bible), \nt Meditation is that special form of concentration in which the attention has \nbeen liberated, by scientific yoga techniques, from the restlessness of the \nbody-conscious state and is focused unfalteringly on God.

To realize the presence of the \nDivine Indweller should be the first desire in every heart. \nIt is when you persistently, selflessly perform every action \nwith love-inspired thoughts of God that He will come to you. \nThen you realize that you are the Ocean of Life, which has \nbecome the tiny wave of each life.

But your delay may be too long, and \nyour suffering may be great. Don't procrastinate. Be certain in \nthe sincerity of your conscience that you have made the effort \nto commune with Him. Don't rest, don't give up until you can \nsee Him with your own eyes, or feel Him in your heart. Birth, \nplay, marriage, children, old age—life is finished. That is not \nliving!

Just as the intricate works of a tiny watch arouse \nour admiration for the watchmaker, and the huge complicated \nmachines in a factory cause us to marvel at their inventor, so \nwhen we see nature's wonders we feel awed by the hidden \nintelligence behind them.

Even so, the mightiest men have \nsometimes met failure. When overwhelming material, mental, \nor spiritual troubles beset us, we realize how limited are the \npowers of life in this physical world. \nOur endeavour must be not only to acquire financial secu-\nrity and good health, but to seek out the meaning of life.

When you give up \nusing that will, you become a mortal man. Many people say \nwe should not exercise our will to change conditions, lest we \ninterfere with God's plan. But why would God give us will if \nwe are not to use it? I once met a fanatical man who said he \ndid not believe in using will power because it developed the \nego. \"You are using a lot of will now to resist me!\" I replied. \n\"You are using it to talk, and you are obliged to use your will \nto stand, or walk, or eat, or go to the movies, or even to go to \nsleep. You will everything you do. Without will power you \nwould be a mechanical man.\" Non-use of the will is not what \n| Jesus meant when he said: \"Not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"* \nHe was demonstrating that man must learn to bend his will, \n* Matthew 26:39. \n"}

At this \nmoment his eyes fell on a sword that was kept in the temple, \nand like a madman he seized it, with the intention of ending \nhis life.

Intensity, secrecy, \ndevotion, and constancy are necessary. You don't know when \ndeath will come. Every minute keep your mind on God. Every-\nthing you want and need is right within you; seek long and \nseek deeply. I meditate for hours; I see no one until I am fin-\nished. You must make up your mind that you are not going to \nbe bothered by anyone or anything. Then you won't know \ntime. \nIn my Yogoda school in Ranchi,* Jharkhand, I used to \nspend all my spare time roaming around the grounds, here and \nthere sitting awhile to meditate, until my mind was drunk \nwith God.

The ancient Hindu sages discovered the exis-\ntence of prana and formulated the science of pranayama,i life-\nenergy control. \nLord Jesus fasted in the wilderness for forty days. He said: \n\"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that pro-\nceedeth out of the mouth of God.\"* \nThe \"word\" is cosmic vibration,- the \"mouth of God\" is \nthe medulla oblongata in the posterior part of the brain, taper-\ning off into the spinal cord. This, the most vital spot in the hu-\nman body, is the divine entrance (\"mouth of God\") for the \n* \"Lifetrons,\" the finer-than-atomic energies that sustain life in all things in \nthe universe. There are two kinds of prana: cosmic energy, the omnipresent \nsource of life and vitality permeating and surrounding all living things; and the \nspecific prana or energy pervading each human body. \nt Through pranayama the adept is able to control the life energy in the sen-\nsory and motor nerves, and thus free his mind from body-consciousness dur-\ning meditation.

Why? Because denial of gross food to the body \ncompels it to depend on immaterial food: the life current. \nMan's will power is the great generator of energy. Through \nwill power and willingness one is able to draw quickly on the \ninfinite store of inner strength. A person who is unwilling to \nperform his daily tasks experiences a lack of energy.

The improper functioning of \nany one (or more) of the five governing pranic currents—vyana, \ncirculation,- udana, metabolism; samana, assimilation,- prana, \ncrystallization; and apana, elimination—adversely affects bod-\nily health. When the natural harmonious balance of these sub-\ntle energies is restored by God's divine power, the atomic bal-\nance of the physical cells they nourish is restored; the healing \nis perfect, and often instantaneous. So long as balanced vital-\nity is maintained by right living, proper diet, and pranayama \nmeditation (life-energy control techniques), the body's own life \nenergy \"electrocutes\" disease before it can develop. \nBalanced Development Is Essential \nInjury and disease are more often the cause of death than is \nold age. Most people die before true old age has set in. In some \ncases, and they are exceptional, all parts of the body grow weak \nat once; such persons die, without pain, like ripe fruit that falls \nin due time from the tree. But the majority are plucked from the \ntree of life before they are really ripe for death. \nIn most cases of death, one bodily part had ceased func-\ntioning before the rest. It may also happen that if one part is \nstronger or more developed than another, the resulting imbal-\nance of the life force in the body may cause suffering and even \ndeath. For example, someone with a weak heart in a strong-\nmuscled body may injure his heart by overuse of his muscular \nstrength. Sandow,* \"the strong man,\" died at fifty-eight when a \nblood vessel in his brain burst as a result of his having raised a \n* Eugene Sandow (1867-1925), advocate of physical culture and wrestling, \nnoted for his physique and physical prowess. The famous athlete travelled \nwidely to expound his ideas on physical fitness. \n"}

But an un-\nlimited source of protection for man lies in his strong thought \nthat, as a child of God, he cannot be affected by disease. \nMind has much greater power than medicine. But to deny \nany power to medicine is unreasonable, because if drugs have \nno power, a man could take poison and not die. While one \nshould not deny the potency of medicines and drugs, one \nshould understand that continuous dependence on them will \nprove their limitations; a time will come when they will lose \ntheir former efficacy in restoring the body to health. The only \ninfinite power of healing lies in man's mind and soul. The body \ncannot be healed by spiritual means if the mental power and \nfaith are weak. Permanent healing comes through the bound-\nless power of the mind and through God's grace. \nFruits, Vegetables, and Nuts Superior to Meat \nAccording to one school of thought, some diseases may be \ncured by eating the organs of animals. A savage devours the \nheart of a lion in the belief that his own heart will thus be \ninvigorated. The tissues of chicken hearts are known to have \na strengthening effect on the heart of man; and the liver helps \nthose who are anemic. However, many health authorities \nstate that iron- and vitamin-rich foods such as eggs, cashew \nnuts, soybeans, molasses, dried apricots, dried lima beans, \ndried peas, parsnips, spinach, and parsley may successfully be \nsubstituted for liver in overcoming anemia. Pepsin taken from \nanimal organs is useful in cases of stomach ulcers,- but papain, \na substance very similar to pepsin, is also present in the fruit \nof the papaya, which is a valuable healing aid to those who \nsuffer from any form of impaired digestion. \nWhen man is sick he may feel justified in eating anything \nthat has healing value, but animal flesh is not actually neces-\nsary for this purpose; indeed, it may increase the bodily burden \nby contributing toxins to the bloodstream. Thus, while flesh \nfoods may aid in healing one illness, they sometimes create a \ncondition whereby another disease may develop elsewhere in \nthe body. That is why the safest diet for man is fresh fruits, \nvegetables, finely ground nuts, and vegetable and diary pro-\nteins. In certain cases the system may not tolerate raw fruits \n"}

Even these, however, have but \na limited potency. The organs of the body are essentially sus-\ntained by the energy of God, and the person who employs var-\nious methods to increase this energy will have at his command \na greater power for healing than is afforded by any medicine or \ndiet. \nPurify the Body of Harmful Toxins \nThree-fourths of the body consists of water; hence the bod-\nily demand for water is much greater than that for food. (Death \nby thirst is a suffering more acute than death by starvation.) It \nis important to give the body plenty of water. Drinking \nunsweetened fruit juices also is good. In localities where water \nhas a calcium content high enough to dispose toward harden-\ning of the arteries in man, he should take, instead, fruit juices \nand watermelons, cantaloupes, and similar juicy fruits. Some \nhealth researchers say, however, that persons who have sinus \ntrouble should not take citrus juices. \nMake it a point to drink plenty of liquids (and I do not \nmean soda-water beverages!) to wash away toxins in the body. \nBut avoid drinking liquids with meals, as this can be injurious \nto digestion. One tends to wash down the food without chew-\ning it properly. If starches are not partially digested in the \nmouth, they often do not digest fully in the stomach. To chew \nfood well is important—the stomach has no teeth. Hasty eat-\ning is harmful; particularly if large amounts of liquid are taken \nwith the meal, thus diluting the gastric juices. Also, drinking \nliquids with meals gives a tendency to obesity. \nIt is important to keep the bloodstream healthy. Beef and \npork may release into the bloodstream toxic poisons and mi-\ncrobes. The white corpuscles try to destroy the microbes, but \nif the latter are strong and if the white corpuscles are insuffi-\ncient to resist them, toxic reactions set in.

As one learns to restrain \nhimself he becomes healthier. It may often happen that one's \ndesire for a certain food is so great that he thinks he cannot re-\nsist it. His senses dictate to him, saying that he must eat that \nfood, even when he knows it may be harmful to him. If he re-\nfuses to perpetuate his bad habits, he will find that he comes \nto dislike what is injurious and to like what is beneficial. \nGreedy people fill themselves and still they are looking for \nmore food. By overeating, they dare to strain a heart-pump that \nhas been overworked for perhaps forty years! \nMany persons thoughtlessly eat late at night. Usually \nsleep soon follows, during which man's internal machinery \nslows down. The food may lie in the stomach without being \nproperly digested. Eating shortly before the nightly rest is \ntherefore unwise. \nThere is nothing worse for body and mind, however, than \ndrinking intoxicating liquors. Under their influence a man may \ndo things that in his right mind he would be ashamed to do. Vi-\nolence, greed, lust for money and sex, even murder, may result \nfrom drunkenness. The belief that wine, sex experiences, and \nmoney will bring happiness is said by the sages to be the chief \ndelusion that man must overcome in order to realize his true \nnature. \nLiquor increases man's desires for money and sex, and it is \ntherefore the worst evil of the three. It is an unnecessary and \nextremely dangerous indulgence, because it stifles reason. A \ndrunken man is no longer a true man. It is wisdom to strive to \nmaintain only normal appetites. \nIncrease Your Natural Resistance to Disease \nFasting is a natural method of healing. When animals or \nsavages are sick, they fast. The bodily machinery thus has an \nopportunity to cleanse itself and to obtain a much-needed rest. \nMost diseases can be cured by judicious fasting.* Unless one \nhas a weak heart, regular short fasts have been recommended \n* In Armenia, Dr. Grant Sarkisyan has successfully used fasting to treat pa-\ntients for a variety of disorders, including bronchial asthma, skin diseases, the \ninitial state of arteriosclerosis, hypertension, stenocardia, and digestive tract \ndiseases.

Another good \nmethod of physical healing is through suitable herbs or herb \nextracts. \nIn using medicines, one often finds that they are not pow-\nerful enough to bring about a healing, or that they are so pow-\nerful that they irritate the bodily tissues instead of healing \nthem. Similarly, exposure to certain types of \"healing rays\" \nwill burn the tissues. There are so many limitations in physi-\ncal methods of healing! \nBetter than medicines are the rays of the sun. In them is a \nwonderful healing power. One should take a ten-minute sun-\nbath every day. Ten minutes a day is better than only occa-\nsional exposure for longer periods*. A short sunbath daily, re-\ninforced by good health habits, will keep the body supplied \nwith sufficient life energy to destroy all harmful microbes. \nHealthy persons possess a natural resistance to disease, \nand particularly to infections. Illness comes when the resisting \npower of the blood has been diminished by wrong eating or by \novereating, or when overindulgence in sex has depleted the \nvital energy. To conserve the physical creative energy is to \nsupply all the cells with vibrant life energy,- the body then \nthe perference being for vegetable and fruit dishes, which Dr. Sarkisyan feels \nare important for longevity. \nIn the Soviet Union, Dr. Uri Nicholayev has given fasting therapy during \nthe past twenty-three years. He states that sixty-four percent of his patients \nhave been helped. Their illness is mental: schizophrenia. \nAt George Air force Base, Victorville, California, twenty-five patients un-\nderwent fasting treatment for up to eighty-four days for obesity. Sixteen com-\npleted the program, with weight losses of forty to one hundred pounds. Dr. \nRobert M. Karns, who conducted the experiment, also reported that a \nfortyeight-years-old diabetic patient, who was receiving twenty-five units of \ninsulin daily before the fast, was able to discontinue the insulin treatment af-\nter the fast. A sixty-year-old patient reported improvement of an arthritic and \nheart condition. \nIn experiments with mice, which are often the testing ground for treat-\nment of man's disorders, it was demonstrated that the life-span could be in-\ncreased by fifty percent. The treatment? Fasting. (Publisher's Note) \n' It is wise to restrict sunbathing to the early and late hours of the day.

The spirit within becomes disassociated from the \ndemands of the body as the body itself is freed from gross \nhabits. I have just passed my thirtieth day of dieting and fast-\ning, and it seems as natural as if I had never eaten. All of you \nwho are able should go on a three-day fast; if possible, a longer \none.* You would begin to discover that you can live without \nfood. \nPains or aches in the body indicate that something is go-\ning wrong with its machinery; repairs are needed. Think how \nconscientiously you keep your auto clean and in good repair. \nMuch more complex than any car is the human body,- and the \nLord wants you to keep it clean and in good running order, also, \nwhile at the same time depending more on Him. The secret of \ngood health does not lie only in chemicals; one should rely \neven more on God's energy within. \nThis life force within our bodies is, in fact, the source of \nlife. It is a conscious power: the creator of the organs, and the \nsupplier of their vitality as well. Ordinarily, life force is con-\ntinually reinforced by mind power and food. But if it has been \ntoo much misused, it gives up and refuses to work anymore. Its \npower may grow dim in the eyes, for example, and then you \ncannot see well. No food gives strength, no change of air in-\nvigorates, nothing can restore energy to the body when its life \nforce begins to diminish. \n* Persons in good health should experience no difficulty in fasting for three \ndays; longer fasts should be undertaken only under experienced supervision. \nAnyone suffering from a chronic ailment or an organic defect should fast only \nupon the advice of a physician experienced in fasting procedures. \n102 \n"}

Undeviating regu-\nlarity in eating, whether the system actually needs food or not, \nis also a curse to the body. The more you concentrate on the \npalate, the more disease you will have. To enjoy food is all \nright, but to be a slave to it is the bane of life. Why should you \nlet nature hurt you? Nature cannot punish you if you are not \nattached to the body or bound by food. You must recognize that \nlife force is the sustainer of the body. \nWithout being fanatic, place the greatest emphasis on the \nmind, with the object of making its power more and more de-\npendable.

Fasting is one of the great ways of \napproaching God: it releases the life force from enslavement to \nfood, showing you that it is God who really sustains the life in \nyour body. \nBut the temptation of Satan is that as soon as the mind \nthinks \"food,\" you want to eat. Once, as a little boy in India, I \nhad a cold and I wanted to eat some tamarind, which is con-\nsidered very bad for colds. My sister strongly disapproved, but \nbecause of my insistence she grudgingly brought me some of \nthe fruit. I took one piece, chewed it, and spit it out.

It runs better for a while, and then something else goes \nwrong and you send it back for further repairs. The same must \nbe done for the body. The physical effects of fasting are re-\nmarkable.

A one-day fast on fruit each week, or a three-day \nfast on orange juice each month, are good ways to accustom \noneself to fasting. The faster must be mentally prepared for \nthose who will immediately begin to sympathize and tell him \nthat he will become sick and die if he doesn't eat. It is true that \non a longer fast you may feel weak during the first few days, \nbecause the life force has been accustomed to dependence on \nfood. But gradually, as the days pass, you no longer feel any \nweakness. Your life force and spirit become detached from \nfood. You see that the body is sustained by life force alone. \nI know the secret by which one can fast and still not lose \nweight.

Life is eternal. It depends not on breath, nor on \nfood, water, or sunshine. Remember always that you are the \nImperishable Spirit. This is the way to live. \nOur consciousness survives after death, but the ordinary \nman loses that feeling of continuity and so thinks he is dead. \n* Matthew 4:4 (Bible): \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word \n[prana, life energy) that proceedeth out of the mouth of God (that flows forth \nfrom the medulla into the body).\" It is through the centre of superconscious-\nness in the medulla that God breathes His \"word\"—cosmic intelligent \nvibration, or energy—into man. A reservoir of this energy accumulates in the \nbrain. Thence it flows down from the medulla into the five spiritual centres \n(chakras) in the spine, which act as distributors, feeding this life energy to all \nParts of the body. \n"}

And \nin that lies the heart of fasting. \nThe Metaphysical Science Behind Fasting \nThere is a great metaphysical science behind fasting. Jesus \nreminded us of this truth when he said: \"Man shall not live by \nbread alone ....\" Two things keep you bound to earth: breath \nand \"bread.\" In sleep, however, you are peacefully unaware of \nany need for either breath or food; your spirit is detached from \nbody-consciousness.

So God says, \"All right, My child, play on.\" \nIf God is seeking anything, it is our love. He knocks at \nevery heart and asks us to come unto Him, but most persons \ndon't want to go. Yet when they get into trouble or become \nsick, they are quick to call for Him. He who makes friends \nwith the Lord while he is prosperous and happy will always \nfind God near when he needs Him.

But intellectual stimulation, also, is only \nanother kind of \"drug,\" a different form of mental juggling that \ndoes not give the seeker what he really needs, any more than \ndoes over-stirring of the emotions. \nReligionists who cling blindly to dogma will often parrot \nwhat they do not really understand or have not realized.

That is why I followed this path. No \none can shake me from it. \nThe liberalist is the other extreme of the dogmatist. He \nfollows everything! In the belief that he is being broadminded \nhe says, \"All spiritual paths are good; therefore I will not bind \nmyself to any one of them.\" While respecting all, it is better to \nadhere to one path than to be a religious butterfly, flitting \neverywhere.

To concentrate \non money or health as primary objectives in following a reli-\ngion is to become sidetracked. True, it is through God that one \nreceives everything else; but he who seeks other things first \nwill feel the bonds of limitations. A qualified spiritual teacher \nknows and loves the Lord; his supreme interest is in God. One \nteacher tried to persuade me to accept his spiritual guidance \nwith the promise that I would have a great many followers. His \noffer did not attract me, because I wanted God alone. Great \nteachers will always seek to interest you in knowing the Lord. \nThey will not take you up a blind alley. \nWithout God-communion, the lifeblood of religion is miss-\ning.

That is \nwhat religion must be. \nIf I tell you of a wonderful fruit I have found, and describe \nit to you in detail every day for a year without ever giving you \na taste of it, you won't be satisfied.

Study the lives of princes and men \nof the world; see how they were vexed.\" We are like puppets in \nthe hands of destiny,- but the man who is one with the Light of \nthe world, who has nothing and yet has everything, is a happy \nman. He who is one with God is not afraid of anything, even \nannihilation of the body. Jesus said: \"Destroy this temple, and \nin three days I will raise it up.\"+ \nThe church has become a beggar.

They \nwill truly fulfill their high calling when they become places of \nGod-communion. They should be like hives, filled with the \nhoney of God-realization. Unless this truth becomes more \nmanifest in religion, you will see that the church as such will \ngradually disappear.

For example, suppose you have weak digestion, yet \nyou want to eat fried foods. Not surprisingly, you suffer every \ntime you do. Although you feel delight while fulfilling that de-\nsire, the aftereffect is pain; thus you are made aware that you \nhave done wrong.

And what is the \nharm in harbouring them? It is this: Every desire consists of \nspecific forces, either good or evil, or a mixture of both. And \nwhen you die, though your body is gone, those forces do not \ndie. As mental tabloids they follow your soul wherever it goes, \nand when you are reborn, these tabloids manifest as behav-\nioural tendencies. Thus, a person who has died an alcoholic \nbrings with him the tendency to alcoholism when he is re-\nbron; and it remains with him until he overcomes desire for \nalcohol. \nThe behaviour of even the smallest child reveals certain \ncharacteristics of past lives. Some children have terrible tem-\nper tantrums,- others are moody. God did not make them that \nway. Unfulfilled desires of past lives fashioned those psycho-\nlogical tendencies,- and, because of them, the soul, even though \nmade in the image of God, appears as something different. If \nthe image of God within you is distorted in this life by anger \nor fear, and you do not conquer such uncharacteristic qualities \nnow, you will be reborn with them; and you will have the bur-\nden of these misery-creating tendencies until you overcome \nthem in some future incarnation. \nIt is better, therefore, to work out or overcome all your de-\nsires now. They would be finished immediately and for all time \nin the supreme joy of God's presence; but until you know Him, \nyour unconquered desires will remain to hound you. \nThere are two ways of finishing your desires—by realiz-\ning, through reason and discrimination, or wisdom, that only \n"}

Some are never liked. Others are neither \nliked nor disliked; they are just ignored. Why? Impartial God \nis not responsible for the uneven distribution of attractive \nqualities. The differences in each man's character are of his \nown cultivation. He himself has created those pleasant or un-\npleasant qualities, in this or in past lives. It would be a great \ninjustice if God were responsible for starting off some children \nwith the advantage of likable good qualities and others with a \nhandicap of obnoxious bad qualities. But it is not He who has \nestablished bad tendencies in some children and good in oth-\ners,- therefore we cannot hold God accountable. \nGod creates all men equal, made in His image. In order to \nsee the justification of man's seeming inequalities, we must \nunderstand the law of reincarnation. Knowledge of this law \nwas buried and forgotten during the Dark Ages. Jesus spake of \nreincarnation when he said: \"Elias is come already, and they \nknew him not.... Then the disciples understood that he spoke \nunto them of John the Baptist.\"* The soul appearing in one in-\ncarnation as Elias (Elijah) had returned in another incarnation \nas John the Baptist. \nThere would be no meaning to life if it did not afford us \nsufficient opportunities to develop our potentials and satisfy \nour desires.

Gandhi has a mission \nto fulfill, and this is a part of his role. If one becomes as great \nas Gandhi, he also may do as he sees fit. \nThe point is, one should not think all the time about the \nbody; nor should he be careless of it. To give the body too lit-\ntle or too much attention makes one become unbalanced, fa-\nnatical.

When you are by yourself you have \na right to think and do what you want to; but when you are \nwith others, you should not be absentminded or uninterested. \nThe company of a corpse would be preferable to that of an ab-\nsentminded person; the indifference of a corpse bears no insult. \nWhen you are in the company of others, be with them whole-\nheartedly; but when your interest in being with them lags, \nmake a polite excuse and withdraw. You have no right to re-\nmain while your mind is absent. \nBe genuinely amiable when you are with others. Never be \na \"sourpuss.\" You don't have to laugh boisterously, like a \nhyena, but don't wear a long face either. Just be smiling, con-\ngenial, and kind. Smiling on the outside when you are angry or \nresentful inside, however, is hypocrisy. If you want to be lik-\nable, be sincere. Sincerity is a soul quality that God has given \nto every human being, but not all express it. Above all, be \nhumble. Though you may have admirable inner strength, don't \noverwhelm others with your strong nature. Be calm and con-\nsiderate of them.

True friends un-\nderstand one another no matter what they do. You should be \nlike that. \nWhat is life unless you have the right kind of friends \naround you? There is a magnet in your heart that will attract \ntrue friends. That magnet is unselfishness, thinking of others \nfirst. Very few persons are free from self-centeredness. Yet one \ncan develop the quality of unselfishness very easily if he prac-\ntises thinking of others first. A mother usually has this qual-\nity. Her life is service. She gives to her husband and children \nfirst. Because she always thinks of others before herself, others \nthink of her. That is the tradition in the homes in India.

By your exemplary behaviour \nyou will have someone else thinking considerately of you \nevery day. When you learn to live for others, they will live for \nyou. When you live for yourself, no one is interested in you. \nYou can best attract others by your good actions. \nIf you look around, when you attend a party, you will al-\nmost always notice some guests who are openly envious of \nwhat others have. No one wants to be with thoughtless, self-\nish people.

Remember \nalso, it may be truth to speak of the blind man as a blind man, \nor the sick man as a sick man, but it is better to avoid such \nbluntness. By the kindness and consideration of your speech \nyou help to uplift others and make them better. \nIt isn't always your words that others listen to, however, \nbut the strength and sincerity behind them. When a sincere \nman speaks, the world moves. When he says something, oth-\ners listen. Some persons talk on and on, hoping to convince the \nhearer by the steady barrage of words. But the captive listener \nis only thinking, \"Please let me go!\" When you talk, don't talk \ntoo much about yourself. Try to speak on a subject that inter-\nests the other person. And listen. That is the way to be attrac-\ntive. You will see how your presence is in demand. \nMy mother was considerate in that way.

He was so surprised! He thought I had \nintended to keep that one for myself. A wonderful feeling arises \nwithin a person when he is considerate of others, thinking first \nof them. As soon as you are concerned for someone else, not \nonly does he think of you, but God thinks of you too. If you are \nthoughtful, doing for others all the time, then even if you part \nwith your last penny to help them, God will return even more \nblessings to you. \nAnother thing to remember: Each one of you has some spe-\ncial quality, a uniqueness, that others have not.

Strive for this,- and once you have at-\ntained it, never lose it. Christ did not lose it when he was be-\ning nailed to the cross. He said, \"Father, forgive them, for they \nknow not what they do.\" The ordinary person cannot bear his \ntests. \nWhen I started on the spiritual path I supposed that only \ngood would happen to me; but I found that many difficult ex-\nperiences also came. Then I reasoned: \"Because I love God so \ndeeply, I have expected too much from Him. From now on I \nwill say, 'Lord, let Thy will be done.'\"Severe trials came But I \nheld to the thought, \"Let Thy will be done.\" I wanted to accept \nwhatever He sent my way.

I was sitting in the library at \nMt. Washington. It was about four o'clock. Suddenly my breath \ndisappeared. My limbs became rigid. I found myself watching \nthe process of death. Breath and movement had left my body, \nyet I was conscious. This experience of death was wonderful. I \nsaw my body and all nature as a cosmic motion picture, cre-\nated from God's light.

Love that becomes personal is exclusive, confined; \nwhen love becomes impersonal, it expands. Develop imper-\nsonal love,- be able to give everyone the same love that you be-\nstow on your family, and to do for others exactly as you would \nfor yourself. The social way to cosmic consciousness is to be-\nhave toward everyone in this way. \nGod loves all His children alike—they are all His divine \nfamily, and His love is impersonal. His children should give that \nsame kind of love to one another. This is the divine plan. To for-\nget it is to suffer. The whole world-attitude should change.

Our \nsensory powers are all directed to the outer world. There is a \ncurrent of life energy flowing from the brain through the nerves \ninto the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin. The sensations we \nexperience through these instruments are the result of this out-\nward-flowing current, and we tend to like the feeling. That is \nthe appeal of the senses. Overindulging them is dangerous; un-\ntil a man is established in wisdom, the outgoing energy leads \nhim into sense bondage. \nBy the five-rayed searchlight of the senses, we perceive and \nexplore the world of matter. Through the senses we learn to \nlike things that are pleasing to see, hear, smell, taste, and \ntouch. The desire for a particular sensation becomes a habit. \nThe trouble is, most people have not had any experience of the \nSpirit, which is hidden behind matter; hence they have no stan-\ndard of comparison between the exciting, pleasurable percep-\ntions of the senses and the unknown ineffable bliss of the soul. \nAnd there is no chance to compare until one has renounced or \nbecome mentally insusceptible to all sense enticements. The \nonly way to avoid the trap is to realize by reason or experience \nthat there are higher joys. \nHabit Is a Pitiless Dictator \nCommandments to refrain from harmful experiences are \ngenerally futile. Whenever you order a person not to do some-\nthing, he immediately wants to do it. The taste of forbidden \nfruits is sweet in the beginning, but in the end, bitter. Yet no \nmatter how much suffering people experience, they go on do-\ning the same self-harming things. Once you have established a \nliking for a certain sensory experience, the habit sits like a dic-\ntator in the brain and commands you to indulge yourself, even \nthough it is against your best interests. You don't want to re-\npeat an act, and yet you do it. Try never to let yourself reach a \npoint where you become such a victim of wrong habits. You \nmust be the master of yourself; do not let any habit control \nyou.

However, \nin true relaxation one is calmly active mentally,- he may reflect \nabout God, or about a beautiful peaceful scene, or about some \npleasant experience. Calm, positive mental activity is revivi-\nfying. Yet many people wrongly associate creative effort with \nstrain, and go about it with a tense, nervous attitude. \nMoods Get Their Grip on a Vacant Mind \nCreative thinking is the best antidote for moods. Moods \nget their grip on your consciousness when you are in a negative \nor passive state of mind. The time when your mind is vacant \nis just the time it can become moody; and when you are \nmoody, the devil comes and wields his influence on you. \nTherefore, develop creative thinking. Whenever you are not \nactive physically, do something creative in your mind. Keep it \nso busy that you have no time to indulge in moodiness. \nCreative thinking is marvellous—like living in another \nworld. Everyone should develop this power. I think hardly a \nword of my lecture before I come here,- but I get into the con-\nsciousness of my subject, and my soul begins to tell me won-\nderful things. When you are thinking creatively, you don't feel \nthe body or moods; you become attuned with Spirit. Our hu-\nman intelligence is made in the image of His creative intelli-\ngence, through which all things are possible; and if we don't \nlive in that consciousness, we become a bundle of moods. By \nthinking creatively we destroy those moods,- and by thinking \ncreatively we will find all the answers to our problems, and to \nthe problems of others. \nMoods are like cancer—they eat into the peace of the soul. \nThat is why the moody man cannot rid himself of his troubles. \nRemember: no matter how wrong everything has gone for you, \nyou have no right to be moody. In your mind you can be a con-\nqueror. When bested, the moody man admits defeat. But the \nman whose mind remains unconquered, though the world be \nin cinders at his feet, is yet the victor. \n"}

Or perhaps you go to someone in great joy, but he is \nmoody and quarrelsome, and finally he gives you a slap. Im-\nmediately your joy vanishes, and you want to retaliate. Do not \nput on the mood of another. The Bible tells us that if anyone \nsmites us on the left cheek, we should turn the right cheek. \nHow many do that? More often, the person slapped wants to \ngive his assailant twelve slaps in reprisal—and perhaps a kick, \nor even a bullet! It is easy to strike back, but to give love is the \nhighest way to try to disarm your persecutor. Even if it doesn't \nwork at the time, he will never be able to forget that when he \ngave you a slap, you gave love in return. That love must be \nsincere,- when it comes from the heart, love is magical. You \nshould not look for the effects; even if your love is spurned, pay \nno attention. Give love and forget. Don't expect anything; then \nyou will see the magical result. \nDo you realize that within you, in your soul, is a superb \ngarden? a wondrous garden of thoughts, fragrant with love, \ngoodness, understanding, and peace, and more beautiful than \nany earthly flowers that grow.

Don't do it, I will use that body.\" As soon as he said \nthis, the man's aged body dropped lifeless to the ground, and \nthe youg man got up from the pyre and ran off toward the for-\nest. The old man was a great saint; he had simply not wished \nto interrupt his devotions by taking rebirth in an infant's help-\nless body. \nFear Enters When God Is Shut Out of Life \nThere are so many wondrous things to know about life and \ndeath, and meditation is the way. Learn to live in this world as \na son of God. Death holds terror for man because he has left \nGod out of his life. All painful things frighten us, because we \nlove the world without understanding its mystery and purpose. \nBut when we behold everything as God, we have nothing to \nfear. We are constantly \"born\" in life as well as death. The \nword \"death\" is a great misnomer, for there is no death; when \nyou are tired of life, you simply take off the overcoat of flesh \nand go back to the astral world. * \nDeath means an end. A car whose parts are worn out is \ndead; it has come to an end. And so at death the physical body \ncomes to an end. But the immortal soul cannot be dead. Every \nnight, in sleep, the soul lives without any consciousness of the \nphysical body,- but it is not dead. Death is only a greater sleep, \nwherein the soul lives in the astral body without the con-\nsciousness of the physical body. If loss of physical-body con-\nsciousness signified death for man, then the soul would die \nwhen we go to sleep. But we are not dead when we are asleep; \nnor are we completely unconscious, because when we \nawaken, we remember whether we slept well or not. So, in the \nafterstate of death we do not die. \n* The Hindu scriptures state that the soul of man is encased successively in \nthree bodies: the idea or causal body, a subtle astral body, and a gross physical \nbody. The astral world is the subtle realm of finer forces to which the soul, still \nencased in its causal and astral bodies, retires at physical death to continue its \nspiritual education and evolution until it incarnates again on earth.

A \ndoubting physical scientist is entitled to express his opinion, \nbut it remains an opinion only, not a fact.

It is not \nuncommon, during a dream, for a person to be aware that he \nis dreaming. Through certain methods and practices, one can \nmaintain conscious awareness during every state of his being: \nwakefulness, dreaming, dreamless sleep, and turiya, \"deep \nsleep,\" the ever-awake superconsciousness (the unrestricted \nregion of mind) beyond dreamless subconsciousness. \nRelaxation in Sleep \nDuring sleep, there is involuntary relaxation of energy \nfrom the motor and sensory nerves.

In \nthe big sleep of death, there is total relaxation—the retirement \nof energy from the heart and cerebrospinal axis. By deep medi-\ntation, this complete relaxation may be produced consciously \nin the waking state.

This instance illustrates the constancy \nof the awareness of \"I-ness\" or personal identity, even though \nthe body is seemingly lifeless. \nThe rishis taught that one must learn to separate the en-\nergy and consciousness from the body, consciously. One must \nconsciously watch the state of sleep, and must practise con-\nscious voluntary withdrawal of energy from the heart and \nspinal regions. Thus he learns to do consciously what death \nwill otherwise force upon him unconsciously and unwillingly. * \nAn Amazing Case \nThere is a case on record, in the files of French and other \nEuropean doctors, of a man named Sadhu Haridas—in the \ncourt of Emperor Ranjit Singh of India—who was able to sep-\narate his energy and consciousness from his body and then con-\nnect the two again after several months. His body was buried \nunderground and watch was kept over the sopt, day and night, \nfor months. At the end of this time, his body was exhumed and \nexamined by the European doctors, who pronounced him dead. \nAfter a few minutes, however, he opened his eyes and regained \ncontrol over all the functions of his body; and lived for many \nyears more. He had learned, by practice, how to control all the \ninvoluntary functions of his body and mind. He was a spiritual \nscientist who experimented with prescribed methods for learn-\ning the truth of cosmic law. As a result he was in a position to \ndemonstrate the truth of the theory of the changelessness of \npersonal identity and the eternal nature of the life principle. \n* The life energy enters the body at the medulla, is stored in the reservoir of \nthe cerebrum, and then descends into five other centres of life and conscious-\nness in the spine, whence it is distributed to the organs of sensory perceptions \nand to all other parts of the body. At death, the life energy retires irrevocably \ninto the spine and leaves the body through the medulla. The accomplished yogi \ncan voluntarily and consciously withdraw the life energy from the body and \nsenses into the spine, directing it upward to the highest centres of divine per-\nceptions, where he is joyously aware of being \"dead\"—freed from sensory delu-\nsions of being limited to a purely physical existence. \n"}

Such a person is like a boy who \nis sick and cannot go to school. The boy does not leave school \nforever; as soon as he is well he goes back to school to start his \nlessons where he left off. So it is with life. If we don't have a \nchance to learn our lessons in this life, we shall have opportu-\nnities to learn them in some other. \nWhen you can see \"behind the scenes\" you will realize \nthat life on earth is a puppet show. It seems real to us now, but \nwhat we are experiencing at this moment will have a dream-\nlike unreality to us a few years hence. And what we are expe-\nriencing now would have seemed unreal to us five years ago, \nhad it been described to us then. Last Sunday most of you sat \nin other seats in the temple, and had other thoughts in your \nmind. Today we are seeing a different \"picture show.\" Reflect \non how many people you have known who are now vanished \nfrom this earthly stage. \nThe concept of life as a changing, passing show is not pes-\nsimistic; it should teach us not to take life seriously at all. \nMaya, cosmic delusion, makes us feel that the body is so real, \nsuch a necessary part of our being. Yet in a moment the body \nmay be taken away from the soul by death, and the separation \nis not painful at all. When that \"operation\" is over, you have \nno need of time, dress, food, or shelter, for you no longer have \nto carry this bodily bundle of flesh. You are free of it. And you \nare still you. Have you ever sought to reason out why this truth \nis hidden? Or where may be now the millions of people who \nhave gone away from our earth?

Otherwise our common sense \nwould tell us that whatever our character is today it will con-\ntinue to be after death—perhaps a little better or a little \nworse, depending on how much effort we are making to \nimprove ourselves. You go along 365 days a year, year after year, \nand perhaps you have made some progress,- but your nature \nwill be the same after death as it was before death. You will \nnot become an angel just because you die! Only the body \nchanges. Death makes no difference, otherwise. Death is like \na gate you will pass through. Your body will be gone but you \nwill be in every other respect the same. If you have a violent \ntemper, you will not leave it behind, at death, with your phys-\nical body. Your violent temper will remain with you until you \nconquer it. If in your present life you have observed the laws \nof healthful living, in your next incarnation you will possess \na healthy body. The last portion of life is more important than \nthe first, because what you are at the end of this life is what \nyou will be at the beginning of the next. \nThe first part of life is usually stupidly misspent, in a sort \nof bewildered state. Then romance comes, and finally disease \nand old age,- the struggle with the body starts. I have coined a \nphrase, \"patchwork living,\" to describe how one has to keep on \npatching and repatching the body to keep it going. The body is \na trouble most of the time: a \"spark plug\" is missing, or the \n\"tires\" give out; you have headaches or a cold, or the stomach \ngoes wrong; there is difficulty with the teeth, and so on. \nAlways trouble, trouble! That is why it is so necessary to your \nhappiness that you realize you are not the body, with all its \naches and pains, but an immortal soul. \nI don't take life seriously at all. I say, \"Lord, anytime you \nwant to remove this body from the soul, it is all right.

If you commune with \nGod you will see that you are already free. You are not the \nbody. You are eternal Spirit. \nIs there any way to find out what we were in our last \nincarnation? Most certainly we can detect basic tendencies of \nthought and capabilities, by analysing what we are now. The \nHindu scriptures say that it takes a million years of harmo-\nnious, disease-free living for the soul to be liberated. Therefore, \ncomparatively little change is to be expected in the ordinary \nman from life to life. But one's spiritual evolution may defi-\nnitely be hastened by determined effort in right living and by \nthe help of a true guru. \nThe sages of India have analysed mankind as belonging to \nfour basic types: the Sudras, those capable of offering service to \nsociety through bodily labour,- the Vaisyas, those who serve \nthrough mentality, skill, agriculture, trade, commerce, busi-\nness life in general; the Kshatriyas, those whose talents are ad-\nministrative, executive, and protective—rulers and warriors; \nand the Brahmins, those of contemplative nature, spiritually \ninspired and inspiring. \nQualitatively, Sudras are those who see in life no greater \npurpose than the satisfaction of wants and desires of the body; \nsuch persons eat, sleep, work, multiply, and finally die. Mil-\nlions today live in the Sudra or \"labourer\" state—concerned \nmerely with the comfort and pleasure of the body. \nThe man in the Vaisya or mentally active state is always \nbusy getting things done. Some people of this class think of \nnothing else but business,- they live only to earn money, which \nthey usually squander on sense enjoyments. But the best \nVaisya type of businessman is much more evolved and creative \nin nature. \nThe third or Kshatriya class are those who, after having \nhad the experience of earning money and of creating something \nalong business lines, begin to understand what life is all about; \nthey strive by self-control to win the battle with the senses. \n(The Vaisya man doesn't engage himself in such effort for inner \nimprovement. He simply earns money and produces children \nand seldom thinks about the meaning of life except in terms of \n"}

But the third or Kshatiiya class takes life more \nseriously. Such a man asks himself, \"Should I not struggle \nwith and destroy my bad habits?\" He feels a desire to overcome \nevil tendencies and to do what is right. \nThe last and highest state is that of the Brahmin: knower \nof Brahma or God. * \nAnalyse Yourself to See How You Should Change \nTo recapitulate the four basic types of consciousness in \nman: Sudra is the sense-bound state of existence; Vaisya is the \nbusiness or creative stage of man. Kshatriya is the warrior \nstate, when man desires to do battle with his senses and to con-\nquer his attachment to them. Brahmin is the wisdom state, \nattained by man when he has overcome all attachment to the \nsenses and remains consciously immersed in Brahma, God. \nEvery human being fits into one of these four classifica-\ntions, and if you analyse yourself you can find your class. \nThink over your life from childhood days and try to reason out \nin which of the four classifications you belong. Reflect on \nwhether you have been living for sense pleasures, only cater-\ning to the senses and earning money; or perhaps just working \nwithout thinking or acting creatively. \nAnalyse yourself and see if you have been creative from \nyour childhood. Some children, for example, think readily \nalong mechanical lines, and want to open up and take apart \nthings so that they can put them together again. Others show \nthe greatest pleasure in drawing, or in playing or listening to \nmusic. It is not necessary to be an expert or a prima donna in \norder to consider that one has shown signs of creativity in this \nlife. Even a nonsensical song such as \"Yes, We Have No Ba-\nnanas\" is a product of a creative mind. \nAnything one creates, whether it is expertly done or not, \nis an expression of creative talent. A flair for writing novels or \nfor acting or for woodcarving or for painting or for music or for \nworking with machinery, if exhibited early in life, indicates \nthat you were probably in the Vaisya state in your past life. \nHusbands and wives should not ridicule each other's or \ntheir children's creative tendencies.

The idea is that if you haven't changed yet, \nit is now time that you should. Otherwise you will carry your \npresent state into the next life too.

That \nprophecy is told in the Book of Isaiah (7:14), eight centuries \nbefore Christ: \"Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a \nsign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall \ncall his name Immanuel.\" St. Matthew, recording the event of \nChrist's birth, stated: \"Now all this was done, that it might be \nfulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, \nBehold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, \nand they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being inter-\npreted is, God with us.\"t \nJesus had learned all of life's lessons in this school of many \nincarnations, and had demonstrated his complete victory over \nmaterial consciousness.

Similarly, this life may be realized as a \ndream only when we awake in Cosmic Consciousness. \nDuring waking consciousness, the thought of a beautiful \nlandscape does not carry with it an immediate power of \nmaterialization. But in sleep we have a heightened creative \npower of visualization and manifestation,- our thoughts swiftly \nerect the various structures of a dream. The projection of \ndream images requires both thought and energy, just as the \nprojection of moving pictures requires both film and the electrical \nenergy of light. \nIn sleep, life energy is released from various bodily de-\nmands and retires to the brain cells, in which are stored the \nthought films of all past experiences. The enlivening action of \nthe energy on the stored-up thought films in the subconscious \nmind results in the projection of the mental motion pictures \nwe call dreams. Dreams are actually lessons in the working of \nCosmic Consciousness. They come to man for a reason,- their \npurpose is to awaken in him a realization of the dream nature \nof the universe and of the method of its operation. \nThe sages of India since ancient times have spoken of the \nuniverse as a materialization of the thought of God. It is easy \nto say, of course, that this universe is a dream. But the \nverisimilitude of \"life\" in our everyday experiences makes it \nnearly impossible for us to believe that the world is nothing \nmore than a cosmic dream.

Many practical benefits will come to us from \nsuch a true understanding of the physical world. \nTo illustrate, let us say that a sleeping man dreams he is \na great and powerful warrior; that he goes to war, is shot, and \nlies dying, fust as he is feeling very sad, he suddenly wakes up. \nHe laughs at his dream fears as he realizes he is not really a \nwarrior, nor is he dying. \nIn \"real\" life one may have the same kind of experience. A \nsoldier who goes to war and is mortally wounded suddenly \nwakes up in the astral world and realizes that the war experi-\nence was all a bad dream—that he has neither broken bones \nnor a physical body. Nevertheless, he is still conscious of life \nand of his individuality. \nIn order to realize that all the happenings of this world are \ndream experiences, we should learn how to visualize our \nthoughts—how to recharge them with the energy of concen-\ntration until they become visible manifestations.

Indescribable billows of \nhappiness surge over my soul. As I passed through various ex-\nperiences over the years, that unchanging inner peace has been \nproof to me of the existence of God. \nI was just thinking this when suddenly I saw a great Light. \nEverything else vanished. There was feeling—that was all. My \nhand was not a hand, but a feeling. When I touched my hands to-\ngether there was no flesh there, only feeling. Then I understood \nthat I had become thoughts,- everything around me, the light and \nthe room and the weight of the body—all were nothing but \nthoughts. \nIt was a delightful experience. Gone were the sorrow and \nsadness I had felt for things past, and in their place a great sense \nof freedom. \nThat consciousness of God-peace is never-ending. It is the \nonly real state of happiness. Everything else will fail you. \nNothing else can make you happy because only the joy of His \npresence is real. \nIt is not necessary to go through every kind of human \nexperience in order to attain this ultimate wisdom. You should \nbe able to learn by studying the lives of others. Why become \nhelplessly involved in an endless panorama of events in order to \ndiscover that nothing in this world can ever make you happy? \nOne may learn the truth in two ways: by undergoing \nmany good and bad experiences, or by cultivating wisdom. \nChoose which you prefer. Krishna said: \"The attainment of \nwisdom immediately bestows supreme peace.\"* Jesus said: \n\"Seek ye first the kingdom of God.\"t If you are seeking some-\nthing else first, you will surely be disillusioned. Each man \nrationalizes, \"Well, others have been deceived, but I won't \nbe.\" Nevertheless, he will be deceived. The only experience \nthat is real, the only experience that brings happiness, is \nawareness of the presence of God. \n* Bhagavad Gita IV:39. \nt Metthew 6:33. \n"}

When you can see every \nwoman as your mother, as some of our God-realized masters \nin India did, universal love comes into your heart. \nCertain sceptical followers of a great saint wanted to test \nhim, and sent to him some beautiful prostitutes.

From that moment they were spiritually \nchanged. \nEvery man who looks upon woman as an incarnation of \nthe Immortal Mother will find salvation. A husband should see \nin his wife the pure beauty of the Mother Divine. Looking upon \nthe wife as the Mother, he will find in her a holy essence not \ndiscerned before. \nMothers would not be able to love their children if God \nhadn't implanted that love in them. Yet credit belongs to the \ninstrument also, because the flood of divine love passes \nthrough the human mother. All the great masters have shown \nhonour to their mothers.

If you look upon \nwoman without lust of the eyes, you will be able to draw from \nher store of spiritual treasures. \nWhy was the mother given such love? That she might love \nher child unconditionally. Loving one's own child is only a \npractice of the love divine. The mother thinks it is her own \nchild, but it is the child of God. The child will be taken away \nas soon as the Divine Spirit calls. So every mother should \nextend that love she feels for her child unto all the children of \nthe earth. \n* Lord Shankara's Prayer to the Divine Mother for Forgiveness of Sins bears \nthe refrain: \"Though bad sons are many, never has there been a bad mother.\" \n"}

From the causal thought-forms \nthe astral body's five instruments of life force make visible the \nastral body of light and the physical body of gross matter. The \nfollowing experiment illustrates the idea. Close your eyes and \nvisualize a horse on the left. At first your concept is fuzzy, but \nif I suggest a white horse, you can more easily visualize it. \nNow think of a black horse on the right side. You are creating \nmental or causal images. Switch them about so that the white \nhorse is on the right side. If you can visualize a little more \nstrongly, you will be able to see these thought-forms as real \nimages. That is what you do in a dream: your mind is more \nconcentrated then, causing your thought-forms to become \nvisible to you. Dreams and visions are astral in essence, being \ncomposed of light and energy. Could you actually make the \nastral images of the black and white horses true to the physi-\ncal senses, you would have materialized a physical creation. \nSo essentially we are made of 35 ideas, which make up the \nideational or causal body of man.

This \"third eye\" can be seen within \nthe forehead, between the eyebrows, by the deeply meditating \ndevotee. The spiritual eye is a metaphysical telescope through \nwhich one can see to infinity in all directions simultaneously, \nbeholding with omnipresent spherical vision whatever is hap-\npening in any point of creation.

How? The social way is by \ncultivating divine love for everything that is. To love all im-\npartially is to know Christ Consciousness. The transcendental \nway is by direct communion with the Christ Consciousness \nthrough yoga mediation. \nThe body continuously reminds you that you are flesh. Yet \nevery night in sleep God banishes your consciousness of the \nflesh to show you that you are not the body. You are not the \nwave, but the Ocean behind the wave. You are not his mortal \nconsciousness, but the Immortal Consciousness behind it. \nJesus declared: \"I and my Father are one.\"* He who knows \nGod becomes one with God.

The divine Christ \nConsciousness hidden in every atom of creation is the same \nas the Cosmic Consciousness of the Father beyond creation. \nFirst you must know how to commune with the Trinity. \nThrough such communion, you become one with Spirit; then \nthere is no longer a Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are \nseen to be the one Spirit. \nThe Pitfalls of Body Consciousness \nConsider the limitations of this physical body. Looking \noutward you see disease, suffering, pain, and heartaches; but on \nthe other, inner side of this body, in the subtle centres of spir-\nitual consciousness, is the Comforter. When your mind follows \nthe stream of ordinary outward consciousness you will know \nHades,- but when by meditating on Aum your mind follows the \nstream of the inner consciousness, you will find the great \nHeaven that exists behind this body.

Is not \nthe life more than meat, and the body more than raiment?\"* \nAs soon as you become concentrated on the limited physical \nbody you will fall into the pit of misery. It is popular in these \ntimes to seek prosperity, but you may become ill and unable to \nenjoy your abundance. Therefore Jesus warned that we should \nseek the kingdom of God first. Your consciousness must be \nwith God. This is man's highest duty. \"For all these things do \nthe nations of the world seek after; and your Father knoweth \nthat ye have need of these things. But rather seek ye the king-\ndom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.\"+ \nHealth or no health, power or no power, seek God first.

Isn't it foolish not to renounce a few material \nthings in order to realize the kingdom of heaven? But seldom \ndo even devout Christians follow what Christ said here; not \nmany are able to follow this path. Yet renunciation is not \nself-punishment; it is the investment of a few temporal \ntrinkets in order to gain the eternal treasure—God. Worldly \npersons have left God for perishable acquisitions, but I have \nleft perishable things for God. \nThe Gita also advises renunciation. Krishna says: \"For-\nsaking all other dharmas (duties), remember Me alone; I will \nfree thee from all sins (accruing from non-performance of \nthose lesser duties).\"+ The shame and trouble and misery that \nwill arise from forsaking worldly duties God will forgive you. \nBut the Gita says more: \"The sages call that man wise whose \npursuits are all without selfish plan or longings for results, \nand whose activities are purified (cauterized of karmic out-\ngrowths) by the fire of wisdom. Relinquishing attachment to \nthe fruits of work, always contented, independent (of mater-\nial rewards),the wise do not perform any (binding) action even \nin the midst of activities.\"X Therein Krishna declares that it \nis not necessary to forsake all things outwardly to find God, \nif everything you do is without selfish motive, and done only \nto please Him. To forget God for worldly duties is to show \ncolossal ingratitude, for we cannot do our duty to our family \nand others without the power borrowed from Him. \nIn India hundreds go away into the forest just to think of \nGod alone.

To have a picture or a statue of Je-\nsus is acceptable if it helps you to dwell on his divine qualities. \nThen you are not worshipping a graven image, but the ideal the \nimage represents to you. Whatever worship ritual you perform \nwith the consciousness of Spirit is pleasing to the Lord. But in \nMoses' time many worshippers had forgotten God; they were \nvenerating mere objects, even sacrificing goats to them. \nIn India it is customary to make a picture or statue of a \nsaint, or perhaps to fashion an image symbolic of a specific \nmanifestation or quality of the Divine, and place it in a tem-\nple. The people offer flowers to God or to the spirit of the saint \nrepresented by the picture or statue, and meditate on the divine \nqualities it symbolizes. Such worship is acceptable in God's \neyes.t True devotees do not allow their consciousness to dwell \non the object, but concentrate with deepest love and attention \non the Spirit behind it. A great saint of India used to go into \nsamadhi (ecstatic communion with God) whenever he offered \nhis devotion before the image of the Divine Mother in the \ntemple where he worshiped. \"I was placing flowers at the feet \n* Bhagavad Gita VII:23. \nt \"Whatever embodiment (a God-incarnate, a saint, or a deity) a devotee strives \nfaithfully to worship, it is I who make his devotion unflinching. Absorbed in \nthat devotion, intent on the worship of that embodiment, the devotee thus \ngains the fruits of his longings. Yet those fulfilments are verily granted by Me \nalone\" (Bhagavad Gita VII:21-22). \n"}

God is infinite. How could an image encase Him? This \nis the reason behind the second commandment. We should not \nworship an image as God, because He is infinite. \nBeing infinite, God cannot be limited to any form, human \nor stone; yet He is manifest in all forms. One can rightly say \nthat God manifests in every man as well as in great saints, for \nHe is present in all. The sun shines equally, also, on a piece of \ncharcoal and a diamond. But the diamond receives and reflects \nthe sun's light, whereas the charcoal does not. Similarly, all \npeople are exposed to the light of God, but not all receive and \nreflect that light. To do so they must purify themselves by \nmeditation and by following the Ten Commandments. \n\"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in \nvain.\" When you say the name of God, you must be inwardly \naware of what you are saying. Were it possible to look into oth-\ners' minds when they are praying, you would see that a great \nmany are thinking about almost anything but the Lord. They \nare taking the name of God in vain. When we pray we should \ntry our utmost to concentrate our whole attention on God, in-\nstead of saying \"God, God, God\" and letting our minds dwell \non something else. An aunt of mine had the habit of saying her \nprayers on beads. She could almost always be seen busily fin-\ngering her beads. But she approached me one day and confessed \nthat although she had been doing this for forty years, God had \nnever answered her prayers. No wonder! Her \"prayers\" were \nhardly more than a nervous physical habit. \nDon't think of anything but the Spirit when you are pray-\ning. Try your utmost to be sincere. The use of beads in prayer, \nand japa, repetition of the name of God, are good when prac-\ntised with devotion and concentration. But these all too often \nbecome mechanical; they are lower forms of worship. But to \nwhisper \"God\" in your heart on beads of love—that is true \n"}

Many people who enjoy criticizing \ncannot themselves stand criticism, and may even have the \nsame flaws they so righteously deplore in another. \nCharacter study is important primarily in this respect: one \nneeds constantly to take note of virtues in others and to \nimplant those good traits in himself. I study character when I \nchoose people with whom to work. But I have an entirely \ndifferent standpoint for choosing. Sometimes I let a person that \nI know is \"bad\" be with me, in the hope that he will change. If \nhe responds to my spiritual thought for his welfare he becomes \nbetter; and if he doesn't, well, I take that chance. I am like a \nmedical doctor who risks exposure to a disease in order to help \na patient. All doctors have to take that chance because their \ndesire is to serve.

It is \nsaid that the salient characteristics of man are revealed in his \nbody—a very sweeping statement. Not all one's physiological \ncharacteristic do tell the real tale of the inner life. \nAristotle studied physiognomy as a guide to character. \nHindu teachers go deeper. They say that the main thoughts of \nall one's incarnations are reflected in the eyes. Though the eyes \nreveal the whole story of the soul, not only of this life but of \npast lives, still it requires a master's mind to analyse the reve-\nlation of your past lives reflected in this life. \nOnce in a while you are walking along and suddenly \nnotice something in the eyes of a passer-by, and you think, \"I \ndon't like him,\" or as the case may be, \"I like him.\" Eyes tell \nthe whole story. Fear, anger, jealousy, greed, generosity, love, \ncourage, spirituality—all these qualities, good and bad, cause \ncorresponding reflections in the eyes. Detectives can control \ntheir facial muscles so as not to betray by their expressions \nwhat they are thinking, but they cannot hide the suspicion in \ntheir eyes. A yogi has calm eyes because he is thinking of the \ntranquil Spirit. \nFacial and bodily features have been studied, even the \nbumps on the head have been analysed; but physical appear-\nance does not always tell the story, and different cultures draw \ndifferent conclusions from their observations. Some say that \nfat people are luxury-loving and don't like to work, and that \nthin people are more spiritual. Yet in India, fatness in a spiri-\ntual person is viewed favourably. Caesar was wary of Cassius' \n\"lean and hungry\" appearance, in which he saw a threat to his \npower. Some writers have theorized that those who are thin \nthink too much, hence flesh doesn't build up on them. A study \nof history shows that both lean and stout people have been \ngood rulers. \nIf you are persistently fat now, you were fat many times \nbefore; or if in this life you are chronically thin, you have been \nthin for several incarnations. You have inherited the tendency \nfrom the past; and no matter what you eat, that thought-pattern \ntends to manifest itself. \n"}

But it takes the intuitive power of a master to \"read\" \none's physiognomy completely and correctly. \nFor example, Socrates was very ugly. He met a great as-\ntrologer who said, \"Socrates, you are the most evil and wicked \nperson I know.\" Socrates' students were very angry at the as-\ntrologer, but their teacher replied: \"You are right. I have been all \nthat in the past. But though I have overcome it by wisdom now, \nstill the things I did then are registered in this body, making it \nappear ugly.\" \nNo two faces are the same.

In such case you might say he is peaceful. \nBut when that comfortably fixed person has too much of this \nkind of peace—which few people have the good fortune to \nexperience—he thinks within, \"I've had enough peace—I \nneed some excitement and diversion.\" Or he may remark to a \nfriend, \"Please give me a knock on the head to make me feel \nthat I'm alive!\" \nThe negative state of peace is derived from the absence of \nthe three mental states of happiness, sadness, and boredom. \nWithout change or excitement, protracted negative peace \nbecomes stale and unenjoyable. But after long-continued \nindulgence in the happy, sad, and bored states, negative peace \nis enjoyable. For this reason, the yogis advocate the neutral-\nization of the waves of thoughts by concentration to achieve \nmental peace. Once the yogi has stilled the waves of thought, \nhe begins to look beneath the lake of calmness, and finds there \na positive state of peace—the ever-new joy of the soul. \nI met a very wealthy man in New York.

One cannot taste, touch, smell, hear, \nor see except through the mind. We seem to experience taste \non the tongue, but it is actually the brain that registers flavour. \nSimilarly, when some part of the body hurts, the pain is really \nin the mind, not in the body-part. We have two instruments for \nperceiving pain: the nerves and the grey matter of the brain. \nBut we perceive only if the mind allows a connection between \nthem. Unless the mind says there is pain, there is no pain. This \nis the marvellous discovery of India's great masters. Under \nchloroform you do not feel pain, because sensations do not \nreach the mind. At the nerve endings there are fine fibres \nthrough which the pain sensations are relayed to the brain. \nChloroform prevents the relaying of these pain signals. \nThe brain is the sensitive instrument of the mind, and all \nthe sensations of the body are reported to the mind through the \nnerves and the brain. The mind, being identified with the brain, \nreceives and interprets these sensations. A mind made strong by \nthe practise of powerful and positive thinking is less affected by \nsensations of pleasure and pain. It recognises sensations in the \nway God intended—as a form of academic experience. \nSensitivity was given to man only to protect the body; \nwithout sensation, one could cut himself badly and not know \nit. Sensitivity was never intended to cause pain. Animals have \nnot developed this faculty to the degree that man has, hence \nthey experience less pain.

I had intended to do some \nwriting, but I was so uncomfortable I could not concentrate. \nThen I chided myself, \"What is the matter with you?\" And I \nprayed: \"Lord, the same electricity makes the heat in the oven \nand ice in the refrigerator. It is cool here.\" All around me the \natmosphere became cool, as though a sheet of ice surrounded \nme. I began to feel great inspiration and wrote without any \ndifficulty. \nAnother time, many years ago, I was travelling across \ncountry in an open touring car. Accompanying me were several \nyoung men, all Self-Realization students, one of whom served \nas my secretary. He and I slept in the car, sharing one small \nblanket. The night was freezing cold. When I went soundly to \nsleep he pulled the blanket completely off me; and when I half \nwakened from the cold I subconsciously pulled the blanket off \nhim! This went on for some time. Then my mind said: \"Why \nare you behaving this way? It is all right. You are warm!\" I \nthrew off the blanket and began to meditate. My body became \nas warm as toast. The students were shuddering with cold \nwhen they awoke two hours later and discovered me sitting \nthere, immobile. I was in divine ecstasy. They thought I had \nleft my body! Roused from samadhi by their exclamations, I \nsmiled and said, \"What is all this commotion about? Let us \nresume our journey.\" \"But you were sitting in this bitter cold \nwith no coat or blanket!\" they protested. Nevertheless, I did \nnot catch cold. I was the only one who was warm! \nWhat you must do is discipline your mind to be more \npositive. If you make up your mind you are not going to catch \ncold, you will be less likely to catch one. The mind must be \ntrained to overcome pain as well. Mental sensitivity magnifies \npain. To magnify pain is to forget the indomitable image of God \nwithin you. \nHabits Begin to Form at Age Three \nThe ancient sages of India taught that all habits begin to \nform in man at the age of three.

Until Master's training, I had caught colds one right after \nthe other. \nSome people say we should depend only on mind, and \nothers believe we should cater to bodily sensations. Both \npositions are extreme. According to one theory, it is good to \nhave a physical examination regularly to see how the body is \ngetting along, just as one has his car checked over periodically. \nThis is sensible enough, but remember, you are not a machine. \nIf your mental well-being is too dependent on the condition of \nthe body, a time will come when the mind is so enslaved by \nthe body's demands that no amount of any kind of physical aid \nhelps. This explains why we have chronic diseases. The phys-\nical debility became chronic because the mind simply refused \nto be master of the body. \nIn the beginning it is better to follow the moderate path. If \nyou have a cut, put a little iodine on it, but don't depend \nwholly on medicines. Take adequate, sensible precautions \nuntil gradually you can depend more on the mind. Even great \nmasters have used medicines, which are, after all, God-created \nherbs and chemicals. Medicine is not necessary to a master, but \nto show that God's power works in countless ways he may \nsometimes choose to use pharmaceutical remedies. In any \nevent, victory lies in the power of the mind. When you know \nwith absolute conviction that you can do without all medica-\ntion with no ill effect, you are victor. \nA certain master who had broken his arm had it treated \nand bandaged. When a rich man came to visit him shortly after, \nhis worried disciples thought that the visitor, seeing their \nmaster with his arm in a sling, might become disillusioned. \n\"Don't pay any attention to these devotees,\" the saint \nremarked. \"They imagine that because you see my broken arm \nyou will think God doesn't look after me anymore.

Still he went on singing to God. When the disciples \npicked him up, they discovered some of the hot coals clinging \nto his back, burning the flesh. The devotees were alarmed, but \nthe master laughed and said calmly, \"Well, why don't you \nremove them?\" He never complained of any pain. Such is the \nmental aboveness masters show. On this occasion the saint \ndemonstrated that he was above pain, and on the other he \nshowed that he was capable of human suffering and of bearing \nit humbly. \nDevelop an adamant attitude toward the body. \"The ideas \nof heat and cold, of pleasure and pain, are produced by the con-\ntacts of the senses with their objects. Such ideas are limited by \na beginning and an end. They are transitory; bear them with \npatience.\"* Why be so sensitive about a little cold or a little \npain? Think of the agony of those who suffer in war. But even \nstronger than the patriot is the spiritual man; he develops a \ngreater mental courage through disciplining his mind to endure, \nand ultimately rise above, every kind of pain and trouble. \nMan's Life Is Totally Independent of the Body \nThe body is only a flesh-covered cage of bones in which \nthe bird of life stays for a time. The life itself is totally inde-\npendent of the body. But the life has become identified with the \nlimiting conditions of the body,- hence it suffers. If you analyse \nbody and mind you will find there is no connection between \nthem, except what you give. Only in the daytime do you accept \nthe sensations of the body. At night in sleep, when your mind \nis detached from the body, you are not aware of its sensations,-\nyou feel a deep peace. \nBeing made in the image of God, man can live in the body \ncompletely separate from physical sensations. But instead he \nadopts the conditions of the body as though they were his own. \nTo be free of sensations, one has to separate himself mentally \nfrom the body. Therefore the saints teach mental detachment \nfrom both pleasure and pain. To understand and experience \nmental aboveness, one must practise it. I have proved this \ntruth to myself, and I know how wrong it is to be sensitive. \n* Bhagavad Gita 11:14. \n"}

St. \nFrancis called the body \"Brother Donkey.\" If one loves a pet \ndog with a deep attachment, he will be sensitive to his pet's \nsensations, even though he is not physically connected with \nthe dog's nervous system. In the same way, our body-suffering \nis due to too much mental attachment to \"Brother Donkey.\" \nThe mind must acquire greater control over the body. To \nbe able to live by the power of mind is wonderful, because the \nmind can do whatever you want it to. How to start depending \nmore on mind? Little by little habituate yourself to heat and \ncold, to sleeping on a hard bed, to being less dependent on \naccustomed comforts. \nWhile I have been speaking to you I have been utterly \nunconscious of the high temperature today,- but just now as I \nmentioned the heat, I began to feel it.

My mind said, \"You cannot \ncontinue the lecture without wiping your face,- it is wet with \nperspiration.\" I reached into my pocket for a handkerchief, but \nfound none. Then I looked in the spiritual eye and suggested to \nmy mind, \"There is no heat at all.\" Immediately the feeling of \noppressive heat vanished; I was calm and cool. \nThe Right Way to Look at Death \nPractise these things and see if what I am saying is not true. \nYou can increase pain by sensitiveness and lessen it by mental \ndetachment. When a dear one dies, instead of grieving unrea-\nsonably, realize that he has gone on to a higher plane at the will \nof God, and that God knows what is best for him. Rejoice that \nhe is free. Pray that your love and goodwill be messengers of \nencouragement to him on his forward path. This attitude is \nmuch more helpful.

America is a land of initiative \nin business, in applied mechanics,- India is a land of initiative \nin spirituality. Initiative is the power to create,- to create \nmeans to do something that nobody else has done; it is trying \nto do things in new ways, and trying to create new things. \nInitiative is that creative ability which is derived directly from \nyour Creator. What have you done in your life with this divine \ngift? How many people really try to use their creative ability? \nWeeks, months, years pass, and they are always the same,- they \nhave not changed, except in age. The man of initiative is as \nglorious as a shooting star—creating something from nothing, \nmaking the impossible possible by the great inventive power \nof the Spirit. \nDon't Be a One-Horsepower Person \nThere are three kinds of people with initiative—the \nextraordinary class, the medium class, and the common class,-\nand there are hundreds of others huddled together in a \"no \nman's land\" of nonentity. Ask yourself this question: \"Have I \never tried to do anything that nobody else has done?\" That is \nthe starting point in the application of initiative. If you \nhaven't thought that far, you are like hundreds of others who \nerroneously think they have no power to act differently than \nthey do. They are like sleepwalkers,- the suggestions coming \nfrom their subconscious mind have given them the conscious-\nness of one-horsepower people. If you have been going through \nlife in this somnambulistic state, you must wake yourself by \naffirming: \"I have man's greatest quality—initiative. Every hu-\nman being has some spark of power by which he can create \nsomething that has not been created before. Yet I see how \neasily I could be deluded with the mortal consciousness of \nlimitation that pervades the world, if I allowed myself to be \nhypnotized by environment!\" But if you say: \"Every avenue of \nactivity is already overcrowded; why try at all?\" you are \nallowing yourself to be hypnotized by a frustrating worldly \nconsciousness. That is why in every walk of life so many men, \nlacking initiative, remain unsuccessful. \n"}

If allowed \nto melt, it becomes liquid, yet has the same weight, remains \ncold, and is still visible, but in a different form. If electricity is \npassed through the melted ice, it becomes invisible hydrogen \nand oxygen. So the one block of ice can be changed from a \nvisible, cold, solid mass to invisible, intangible gases with the \nsame weight. The process may be reversed, and the gases \nrecondensed into liquid and frozen into the vanished block of \nice. Similarly, the solid human body can be reduced to liquids \nand evaporated into invisible gases; but man has not yet \nlearned how to bring it back in its original form. Not yet does \nhe know the link between mind and body, Spirit and matter. \nThat missing link is cosmic energy. \nFinely vibrating conscious energy becomes pure con-\nsciousness, and, vibrating at increasingly grosser rates, mani-\nfests as the body. When by use of his will man attains supreme \ncontrol of the energy in his body, he will be able to melt the \nvibrations of his solid physical body into astral energy, and the \nastral energy into mental energy. And by the same method he \nwill be able to materialize his consciousness into the astral \nbody and condense it into the physical body. The Gita refers to \nthis power. \"He who realizes by yoga the truth of My prolific \nmanifestations and the creative and dissolving power of My di-\nvine Yoga is unshakably united to Me. This is beyond doubt.\"* \nScientists today can control chemical changes of the body, \nbut they do not yet understand the biochemical control of \nmater.

In the mother aspect of wom-\nanhood there is purity. Woman was given the motherly instinct \nto save man from the pitfall of evil. That is her primary pur-\npose; she was not created as an object of lust. Nothing is more \nsacred than the unconditional sympathy of woman toward \nman. A stern, dignified court judge is but a child to the wife in \nhis home. Every woman should feel love for all the world if she \nwould manifest the Divine Mother's love. To inspire mankind \nwith mother love is to bestow the greatest blessing a woman \npossesses. \nGod Is Both Father and Mother \nIn creating this universe God revealed two aspects: the \nmasculine or fatherly, and the feminine or motherly.

On other occasions, Paramahansaji has also pointed out \nthat form and qualities presuppose manifestation, and manifestation presup-\nposes relativity. Mother Nature must also enforce the inherent and inexorable \ncosmic laws of the universe. Break those laws, and Divine Justice dispenses its \ncorrective punishment; hence the fierce demonstrations we sometimes behold \nin nature. These are results of man's own wrongdoing, which throws the \ncosmic harmony out of order. (See karma in glossary.) But the consistent \nbeauty of Divine Mother is that if the devotee appeals to Her unconditional \nlove, She may be persuaded to assuage the retaliatory power of those laws. \nThus in Hinduism, Divine Mother is sometimes depicted as Kali; her four arms \nsymbolize cardinal attributes, two beneficent and two destructive—the \nessential duality of Mother Nature.

The Christian and \nHindu scriptures describe God as triune: Father, Son, Holy \nGhost—Sat, Tat, Aum. The Father is the wisdom aspect of \nGod; Holy Ghost, the mother aspect; the Son is cosmic cre-\nation—the emblem or principle through which the father and \nmother aspects of God express their divine love.

If it were not for memory we would forget all \nour perceptions of life; we would have to start afresh, like \ninfants, every day. A person who has \"lost\" his mind, and \nhence his memory, behaves like a child. \nThere is no value in having experiences if we cannot recall \nand relive them. We learn by introspection and by analysing \nour past behaviour. In man's memory lies the value of being a \nhuman creature.

As an aid in developing \nmemory we should eat foods that increase brain power. Pro-\nteins are helpful in developing memory. Ground-up pecans and \nalmonds, mixed with a few drops of lime or orange juice and \ntaken before bedtime, will improve one's brain power, yogis \nsay,- milk and cheese also are good brain foods. \nYogis suggest that, at times of worry or strain, one should \ndrink the juice of one or two limes in a glass of water, rinse the \nhead with cold water, and apply cold water on the temples, \nbetween the eyebrows, and at the nostrils and ears. The nerve \nprocesses are calmed immediately, the mind becomes more \npeaceful, and good memory returns. \nAvoid eating too many fatty foods, which tend to cause \nfatty deposits to build up in the blood vessels on the surface of \nthe brain. The Hindus say that pork and beef are injurious to \nman's health; these two meats contain much uric acid. The pig \nand cow have poor memories. By eating their flesh, man may \ndevelop their physical and mental traits. \nPractise Exercising Memory \nMemory can be developed by exercising it. It is incorrect \nto say that a man who was born a physical weakling can never \nbecome strong. There is always the possibility of becoming \nand accomplishing something greater in all departments of our \nlives. One has to know how to seek the right ways.

But it has been proved that many mental deficiencies \nmay be overcome by the practice of concentration exercises. \nThere has been little research in this direction in the West; \nhence many psychologists are unacquainted with the art of \ndeep concentration, which has been taught for centuries by \nIndia's great yogis. \nThe correct methods for developing concentration are \nunknown to most people. The mental faculties are there, but \nthey are not developed. Failure to develop one's mental \ncapacities eventually leads to serious trouble. The brain, like \nthe physical body, requires right exercise for health. \nTo develop a good memory, therefore, one should not only \nexercise the body and eat health-building food, but should also \nengage in mental discipline. Make an effort to remember \nthings. Practise the art of visualization: look at a certain object \nor at scenery and then try to reproduce that picture in your \nmind. Trying to recall the strains of songs and chants, and \nsinging them mentally, develops memory. Anything that is \ndone with feeling, or that rouses feeling, develops memory. \nBoth poetry and music have emotional values. All of us re-\nmember easily the greatest sorrows and the greatest joys of our \nlives. Why? Because those experiences were felt deeply. Any-\nthing that one strongly feels develops one's power of memory. \nWriting poetry, and adding and subtracting mentally are also \ngood methods for developing memory and concentration. \nMeditation Strengthens Memory \nTo increase one's power of memory, one should do every-\nthing with deep attention. Most people carry on their activities \nabsentmindedly,- there is a great gulf between their actions and \ntheir thoughts. That is why they cannot remember anything \nvery well. What one wants to recall he should perform with \ngreat attention. One should not be fussy, but whatever he \nundertakes should be done with his whole mind. In church one \nshould listen to the sermon with keen attention. Work at tasks \nin the home with attention and interest. Keeping the conscious \nmind on the task at hand does not prevent one from reflecting \nconstantly on God in the background of his mind. But when \n"}

The power of \nmemory is strengthened by meditation. \nWhat is meditation? Becoming one with the soul. It means \nbanishing the consciousness of being related to the body and to \nhuman limitations, and trying to remember that one is a soul. \nWhen man begins by conscious mental effort to relate himself \nto the immortal soul, rather than to the body that he inhabits \nfor one life only, he will recall more of his past-life experiences, \nand will eventually remember that he has come down from the \nbosom of God. In Him lies the memory of all the experiences \nof one's life and of all lives. When man communes with his \nsoul within, the forgotten times and powers of the deathless \nSelf will come back into his consciousness. Meditation means \nto remember that one is not a mortal body but an immortal \nsoul, one with God. \nDuring the daytime we tend to think of ourselves as \nhuman beings, but at nighttime in deep dreamless sleep we \nforget our mortal attitude. In meditation we can try con-\nsciously to forget our mortal identification; we can abandon \nthe consciousness of the body and remember we are Spirit. \nThose who persevere in this practice will become masters. \nRemember Good Experiences \nMemory was given to man to reproduce good. To abuse the \npower of memory is harmful. To think hatefully of another per-\nson because of some remembered injury he inflicted on you is \na misuse of memory. However, to recall unhappy experiences \nin order to learn the lessons inherent in them is a proper use of \nmemory, as then one may analyse his past behaviour and avoid \nrepeating in future the wrong acts that brought painful results. \nOne should not bring back any wrong thought and relive it; for \nthen it will stay longer in the mind. Memory was given to us \nto keep alive only life's good experiences and lessons. Get rid \nof wrong past thoughts by avoiding recalling them. If they \ncome to mind in spite of you, refuse to entertain them. \nLet me repeat: to remember bad experiences and dwell \nupon them is an abuse of God's gift to us of memory.

The best way to read a book is to in-\ntrospect about it. See how it applies to your own life. And learn \nto discriminate.

God is \"hard to get\" because not everyone \n\"means business\" with Him. The technique of prayer is usu-\nally ineffectual because most prayers are not deep or devotional \nenough.

So is the divine man; \nhe hides from people and meditates upon the Lord. Drinking \ndeep of the intoxicating wine of God's presence, he whispers, \n\"Lord, You are so wonderful, so marvellous!

Then I asked: \n\"Do you see Christ?\" \n\"I don't deserve it,\" he answered. \"Maybe after death he \nwill visit me.\" \n\"No,\" I assured him, \"you can see him from tonight if you \nmake up your mind.\" Tears were in his eyes, and he remained \nsilent. \nYou must pray intensely.

There is no other way. If every-\none in this world were a millionaire there would still be trou-\nbles and sorrows, for you cannot buy unshakable happiness. \nThat comes only by following a technique of yoga, and by \ndevotion, by going within. Practising yoga is half the battle. \nEven if you don't feel enthusiastic in the beginning, if you go \non practicing you will come to feel that tremendous longing for \nGod which is necessary if you are to find Him. \nWhy don't you make the effort? Whence do all the beauti-\nful things in creation continually emerge? Whence comes the \nintelligence of great souls, but from the storehouse of the Infi-\nnite Spirit? And if these wonders you see about you are not \nenough to induce you to seek Him, why should He reveal Him-\nself to you?

Satiety will \novertake you, so that nothing gives you pleasure.

I tired of the pleasures of \nlife very quickly,- * and this world would have been extremely \nboresome to me had I not sought and found the joy of God. \nThe happiness and abundance I find in Him are measureless. \nEternity is not long enough for me to explain the joy of the \ndevotee's heart when God enters. This is not exaggeration, \nbecause God's joy is eternal—unceasing, ever new, boundless. \nAll of us have glimpses of it now and then—soul recollections \nof a state of eternal happiness. \nIn this world everybody wants to use us for his own pur-\npose.

When someone's company gives you pleasure, you tend \nto think you love that person.

What it means to love someone else more \nthan oneself is very difficult to understand, and even more \ndifficult for the average person to practise. To illustrate, I will \ntell you a true story of real love. \nThere was in India a devoted husband who loved his wife \nvery deeply. Another man became infatuated with her. She ran \naway with her lover, who eventually left her without friends or \nfunds. One day her husband came to see her. He spoke gently. \n* The death of Paramahansaji's mother when he was about eleven was a turn-\ning point in his life, strengthening his already ardent spiritual inclinations into \nan iron resolve to find God. The divine wisdom garnered in previous incarna-\ntions manifested early in this one; thus he was able by discrimination to see \nthe inherent disillusionment in the experiences of this world, and to realize \nthat lasting happiness could come only from God.

To satisfy every whim is not so easy in the world! \nOthers may push him around in order to gain their own ends; \nand he too becomes callous in order to satisfy his whims and \ndesires. \"Believing that fulfillment of bodily desires is man's \nhighest aim, confident that this world is 'all,' such persons are \nengrossed till the moment of death in earthly cares and \nconcerns.\"* \nParents should try to equip their children with firm will \nand discrimination, so that they can make their way in the \nworld and still remain apart from its bad habits. Teach children \nhow to be really free. Don't let them become slaves to the body \nand to undesirable habits. It is good to train a child in regular-\nity of daily habits, but he should be trained also in evenmind-\nedness: if he gets to sleep on time, all right; if not, all right. If \nhe has his dinner on time, fine; if he cannot eat on time, fine. \nChildren should be taught to respect the rights of others; but \nto be free of habit slavery to anything or anyone. \n* Bhagavad Gita XVI: 11. \n"}

But he knew the relationship between mind and \nbody; he saw them as a delusory creation in the cosmic dream \nof God. The body is merely a cluster of sensations. It is not \neasy to cut off sensations, but you can do so by remaining con-\nstantly in the consciousness that you are a soul, one with \nSpirit. When the mind is almost wholly dominated by the body \nand its demands, as is the case with most persons, it is best to \nbegin gradually, in little things, to dissociate the mind from the \nbody. \nOne difference between an ordinary man and a superman \nis that the ordinary man cries and gives in to suffering if he is \nhurt, but the yogi is established in the consciousness that he is \nnot the body, that he is apart from it.

It comes from taking on the negative \nkarma of others, and has no connection with misery-producing \ndesires of self. If this body does some good to the world and to \nothers, fine.

Sages say that the soul doesn't like \nbeing caged in the feeble little baby body; its first experience in \nthat form is to cry. The soul realizes that in the human form it \nwill again go through many struggles, and says, \"Lord, why did \nyou put me here again?\" Many babies' hands are folded at \nbirth. Their soul is worshipping God in this way and praying, \n\"O Spirit, release me in this life.\" \nWill is a tremendous factor in life. It is the power by which \nyou can reach the heights of God-realization, or go down into \nthe deepest strata of ignorance. The cry of a newborn child is \nan expression of physiological will; the baby wills to remove \nthe discomfort it feels. Most people have not risen above that \nstate of babyhood. They immediately want to be rid of any \ndiscomfort, and whenever they see anything that attracts \nthem, they cry for it. They think they have got to have it, that \nthey can't live without it.

To \ndo duty to God without duty to the world is all right. And to \ndo duty to the world and not to God is to be like a mule carry-\ning a bag of gold. The mule knows only the weight of the gold; \nhe cannot use it. To do duty to God first, and then, with His \nconsciousness to help the world, is divine.
