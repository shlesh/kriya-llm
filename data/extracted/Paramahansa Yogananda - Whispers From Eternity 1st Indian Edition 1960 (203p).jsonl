Instead, dig\ndeep in the mines with the pickaxe of attentive,\nreverent, and meditative study; and finally find\nthe priceless gem of Self-realization.”’\n\nAMELITA GALLI-CURCI\n"}

May the\nSpirit in these devotional outpourings restore\nin many men the wilting blossom of high as-\npiration.\n\nIn naming the book Whispers from Eternity\nI mean, by Eternity, God in the aspect of the\nEternal Mother. In the Lord’s transcendent as-\npect, the Absolute, He is unreachabie by human\nthought; but in His immanent aspect——permeat-\ning the atoms of the universal structure,\nexternalizing Himself in man and Nature—He\nis near and approachable, the Refuge and\nRedeemer of every creature.\n\nIn the Hindu scriptures His immanence is\nsymbolized as the Mother that presides with\nwatchful love 5727४ (16 destinies of countless be-\nings and over the developments of the endless\ncycles of creation.*\n\nIt is this personalized aspect of the Ultimate\nReality that may be said to have “longings” for\nthe rightful behavior of Her children and to\nanswer gladly their prayers.\n\n* See pages 151-155, and Yuga in glossary.\n\n[ix]\n"}

Down the ages He has materialized Him-\nself before the gaze of true deyvctees in whatever\nforms they hold most dear. A Christian sees\nJesus, a Moslem sees Mohammed, a Hindu sees\nKrishna or Rama,* and so on.\n\nThe Lord yearns to behoid each man playing\nperfectly his given role on earth. It is by misuse\nof free will that human beings thwart the divine\nplan. Absence of the clamor of egotistical desires\nenables us to hear and heed the guiding Voice\nwithin. Free from self-will, men of wisdom carry\non their activities in effortless accordance with\nGod’s design.\n\n“Not as I will, but as Thou wilt,” Jesus\nprayed. No karma'accrues to the man who right-\nfully enacts his part in the drama of earthly life.\n\nDivine recollection is the simplest way to\nachieve God-communion. Our inner assertion of\nSpiritual identity is sufficient to operate the law\n\n* See glossary\n"}
