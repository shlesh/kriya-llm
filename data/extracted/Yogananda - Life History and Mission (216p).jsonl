It is lovingly offered by a devotee to devotees: to \nthose who might be interested in detailed insider-information about \nYogananda's life, and about the history of his work. It might be \ndescribed as unorthodox, as it doesn't follow any particular party \nline.  \n \nEvery topic has been diligently researched. Of course errors and \nmisunderstandings are bound to be found: perfection is not of this \nworld, and has certainly not been attained by the author. The texts \nare not written in scientific fashion, but are meant to read easily. \nPlease forgive any inevitable inaccuracies in the English language: \nthough the author has been speaking English daily for many years, \nit's not his mother tongue. \n \nMost of these chapters have earlier been published in a raw form \non another site, which is now regretted, since that site is \nuncharitable. But back then the author didn't know where else to \nplace them. \n \nIf you should happen to find yourself in disagreement with any \nstatements in the book, please take it as an opportunity to \nstrengthen your \"harmony-muscle.\" The book's intention is simply \nto describe Yogananda's history as accurately as possible. It doesn't \nclaim to be always right, and presents the understanding of just one \nperson. \n \nAll quotations and photos are in public domain. \n \n"}

Their \nproblem was that there was no road, no way to get up there. And \nthe hill was quite steep. So a cable car had to be built first, which \nwas inaugurated in 1909. At the same time a road was carved out \nof the mountainside, which led to the top. Of course in those days \ncars were relatively rare, and were not built for mountains at all.  \n \nHere is a picture of a typical car of the time. \nFor more detailed information about the \nMount Washington cable car and more, \nvisit www.erha.org/washington.htm \n \nThe construction of the Mount Washington Hotel itself was \nfinished by January 1910, during the year when Yogananda met \nhis guru, Sri Yukteswar. By that time the LA population had \nalready risen to a proud 320,000. \n  \nWhen in 1925 Yogananda became the owner of the spacious \nMount Washington Hotel, he himself was still a somewhat young \nman of 32 years. The hotel, however, was much younger, only 15 \nyears old. Still, during its first few years of existence it had already \nlived through many adventures, many changes, and many definite \nsurprises, as we will see. \n \nTo complete the population picture: In that year of 1925, when \nYogananda established his headquarters on top of Mt.Washington, \nthe LA population had already risen to about one million \ninhabitants. When Yogananda passed on, in 1952, the number had \nrisen to about two million, meaning about two million more than a \nmere 100 years earlier. \n \nThe \"Mount Washington Hotel\" was designed to be a mountaintop \nresort, with 14 beautifully landscaped acres.

(A \ntruly exotic building, especially for those early \nyears, as one sees on the photo. \n \nInterestingly, the Mount Washington Hotel too \nhad an Eastern touch to it, even before Yogananda acquired it: it \nhad a beautiful Japanese garden in front of it, as well as a roof \ngarden. In the original plans, this Japanese garden was to include \nan observation tower (Yogananda, as you will see, later had the \nsame plan), offering a spectacular view of the beautiful mountains, \nvalleys and the sea. The Mount Washington Hotel, incidentally, \nwas built in the so-called \"missionary style.\" Its mission, however, \nwas very different from what the Western world had seen so far: \nSelf-realization, the discovery of man's inner divinity. \n \nMr. Grauman and Yogananda, it may be added, were not only \nconnected through their beautiful and special buildings. They \nbecame acquainted. Yogananda invited Mr. Grauman to visit Mt. \nWashington as a guest of honor for a feast for Indian athletes, in \n1932. Yogananda, in turn, gave talks at his Chinese Theatre.  \n \nThe Mount Washington Hotel had 18 rooms. Today it is fun to still \nsee the original numbers on the doors. Each room had a private \nbathroom, which was quite extraordinary for the time, and proofed \na great treat for future nuns who would later occupy these quarters. \nThe monks were living in the basement, where employee rooms \nhad been built, using a common bath. \n \nHere is a picture of the impressive Mount Washington Hotel in the \nearly years: \n"}

Thus \ntwo tennis courts soon graced the property. Tournaments of \nfamous players were held there.

Mt. \nWashington became an exclusive and highly desirable hilltop \nresidential site. It offered a fine dining room, with food cooked by \ngourmet cooks.

On weekends usually all rooms \nwere rented out.  \n \nSo well did the hotel business go that in September 1911, the LA \nTimes stated that the hotel planned to add an additional 100 rooms \nand 50 baths! That plan, however, was never carried out. Too bad. \nYogananda might have enjoyed the many extra rooms, \nandespecially the monks. \n \nIt was also reported that 3,500 passengers were carried to the \nsummit on a single Sunday afternoon (imagine the crowds!). The \ncable-car station down on Marmion Way was so busy that a \nrefreshment stand was opened in the depot. It appears that Mt. \nWashington had truly become the 'in place'.  \n \nThe building lots on Mount Washington, too, got a big boost: they \nsold increasingly well. Beautiful and costly homes began to spring \nup all over the mountain, where not a single house had been seen \njust a few years ago. \n \nMost of all there was one fascinating reason why the Mt. \nWashington Hotel became so attractive: The 18 hotel rooms were \nbeing used by celebrities, such as..... lo and behold... Charley \nChaplin, who always stayed at the hotel while making a film at the \nSycamore Grove studios. Other stars of screen and sport also took \nrooms there. It became a gathering spot of the famous. Small \nwonder that people flocked in like birds. Did Yogananda know that \nhis beloved headquarters once housed a Charley Chaplin, and all \nthose other stars? Well, he must have known. Did he care? Did the \nnuns have fun at the thought that some movie star had once \noccupied their room? \n \nBut alas, Mount Washington's early glory was soon put to a rough \ntest: hard times began. The film stars left the Sycamore Grove \nPark, moving to Edendale, and then to Hollywood: it had a \ndevastating effect on the Mt. Washington Hotel. Once the stars had \nleft, less and less visitors came to pay Mt. Washington a visit. \n"}

Car owners soon \ndiscovered the pleasure of traveling to more distant destinations. \nMount Washington Hotel became more and more forgotten.  \n \nIn January 1919 the Mt. Washington cable car was actually closed \ndown. With great effort the inhabitants tried to keep it going. But \nto no avail. The whole Mt. Washington mountaintop was now \nwithout any public transportation. Monastic life on Mt. \nWashington thus began quite involuntarily: without service by the \ncable cars, the entire top of Mt. Washington was completely \nisolated from the outside world. Automobiles could still drive up \nthe steep dirt road, but it often defied the capabilities of those early \nvehicles. And without a car, Mount Washington could only be \nclimbed by a hefty walk. \n \nIncidentally, the cable-car tracks, which lead up to the hotel were \nonly taken away in 1930. Thus Yogananda and his little early band \nenjoyed this \"souvenir\" of the old tracks for five years. \n \nLots of advertisement ensued to save the once famous Mt. \nWashington Hotel, but again to little avail. It suffered a steady \ndecline, and finally had to close, sometime during the summer of \n1921. By then Yogananda had reached America's shores, knowing \nthat one day he would find the building of his visions. \n \nMeanwhile in 1922 a Military School occupied the hotel: \"An ideal \nschool for boys and young men in an ideal location. From grammar \nschool through high school. Personal supervision under high-class \ninstructors. Individual instruction if necessary. On a 20 acre \ncampus.\" The school didn't last, but Yogananda was soon to pick \nup the idea again. \n \nIn 1923 the hotel became the Goodrich-Mount Washington \nEmphysema Hospital. But the respiratory hospital closed in late \n1924 or early 1925. The art of breath would not be lost there, \nhowever: Yogananda had a lot to say on that specific topic. \n"}

(In 1924, Yogananda had started his \nmaiden cross-country lecture “campaign”, after having stayed in \nBoston for his first three years in America.) Looking for a place for \nhis headquarters, he finally found and bought the Mt. Washington \nHotel. At that time it was full of vagrants, many of the windows \nhad been broken. The place had become almost a wilderness. (The \ncover picture of this book is just there at that moment.) It had its \ngood side, however: Yogananda acquired the hotel for a very \nreasonable price, $45.000. Of course the help of Divine Mother's \nloving hand was involved! The story of how he obtained it is \nbeautifully described by Swami Kriyananda in \"The New Path.\"  \n \nIt was a major step for Yogananda’s mission. He rushed to send \nphotos of his new headquarters to his guru, Sri Yukteswar. In his \nAutobiography he wrote: \n \n“With the help of large-hearted students, by the end of 1925 I had \nestablished an American headquarters on the Mount Washington \nEstates in Los Angeles. The building is the one I had seen years \nbefore in my vision at Kashmir. I hastened to send Sri Yukteswar \npictures of these distant American activities. He replied with a \npostcard in Bengali, which I here translate: \n11th August, 1926 \n Child of my heart, O Yogananda! \n Seeing the photos of your school and students, \nwhat joy comes in my life I cannot express in \nwords. I am melting in joy to see your yoga \nstudents of different cities. Beholding your \nmethods \nin \nchant \naffirmations, \nhealing \nvibrations, and divine healing prayers, I cannot \nrefrain from thanking you from my heart. \nSeeing the gate, the winding hilly way upward, \nand the beautiful scenery spread out beneath the \nMount Washington Estates, I yearn to behold it \nall with my own eyes.\" \n"}

In the very first issue of East-West, Nov. Dec. \n1925, Yogananda announced the formal opening of his \nheadquarters in October 25, 1925. Actually, and maybe \nsignificantly, he had named it: \"Mount Washington Educational \nCenter\"—Headquarters of Sat-Sanga and Yogoda. \n \nHere is what the announcement said: \"…The main object and \ndesire of Swami Yogananda' s heart is to have it made possible for \nhim to establish a YOGODA-HOW-TO-LIVE-SCHOOL on \nMount Washington for training children along the lines of \nYOGODA (harmonious development of all human faculties) and \nSAT-SANGA (Fellowship with Truth), aiming at similar physical, \nmental and especially spiritual results. \n \nBesides \nthe \nYOGODA-HOW-TO-LIVE-SCHOOL, \nSwami \nYogananda also plans to offer to adult students, Courses in \nPsychology, Philosophy and all branches of Scientific Spiritual \nRealization, and also Correspondence Courses in the above \nsubjects. Eventually the Center plans to have a Taj or Tower, a \nlarge Swimming Pool, a Library, Printing Press, and a Museum \ncontaining rare and interesting objects, especially from the Orient. \nThrough the grace of the Great Divine Power, may this Center on \nMount Washington become a magnet of world-wide interest and \nattraction, and be a Mecca for those who are spiritually hungry.\" \n \nYogananda’s “main object and desire” for Mount Washington, \nthen, was to establish a school for children. Is that surprising? \nProbably, because nowadays we would not easily hear that piece of \ninformation: we hear that Yogananda came to create a monastic \norder. But this early text seems to indicate that Yogananda saw his \nmission in the West in quite broad terms, of which a monastic \norder was only one (if central) part. Fun also to hear about the \nlarge swimming pool. That plan was actually fulfilled later: He had \none built at Encinitas (still there), and one at 29 Palms. \n"}
{"doc": "Yogananda - Life History and Mission (216p).pdf", "page": 26, "text": " \n26 \n \nLet's digress here for a moment. Trying to grasp the main \ndirections of Yogananda’s work throughout his life, one may see \nthe following phases: \n \n1) In India he started his mission by heart building a school, \noffering a balanced education to children, with spiritual practices \nas a main feature. \n \n2) In America, after teaching in Boston for 3 years, a “main object \nand desire” was to establish a school, at Mount Washington. \nSwami Dhirananda, a close friend from India, was called to be in \ncharge of Mount Washington, whenever Yogananda was touring. \nYogananda \nannounced \nin \nthe \nfirst \nEast-West \nmagazine: \n“Dhirananda will conduct a Sunday School class for boys and girls \nevery Sunday morning at Mount Washington, and attend to the \nwork of the Yogoda Correspondence Course, as well as carry on \nfurther the spiritual work as it develops.” Besides the school, \nYogananda's other goal of course was the spiritual training of \nadults. \n \n3) Dhirananda’s (a high soul, of course) departure in 1929 was a \ngreat blow to Yogananda, and actually seems to have changed the \ndirection of his work: from then on, one doesn’t read much more \nabout schools. Instead, the monastic era started. Yogananda’s \nmonastic pillars arrived: Durga Mata (1929), Daya Mata (1931), \nand Gyanamata Mata (1932). “Yogoda Satsanga” became “Self-\nRealization Fellowship” in 1934, and in 1935 was registered as a \nchurch. Yogananda gave his heart and soul to those who wanted to \nlive for God alone. \n \n4) After returning from India, Yogananda often stayed in \nEncinitas, working on his writings. A new interesting direction \ncrystallized: he began to talk and write frequently about his ideal \nof a “Golden World City,” or “World-Brotherhood Colonies.” He \nstarted such a one for families in Encinitas (with opening talk and \nall), and included Colonies in his “Aims and Ideals.” It was, of \n"}

It was a parallel \nvision. He wrote in 1946: “Dear Father, bless us with the physical \npower by which we can control constructively atoms and the forces \nbehind it, bless us that we establish the temple of atomic control in \nthe souls of men, and in Self-Realization, and in our Golden World \nCity.” \n \n5) After Yogananda’s passing, the monastic life alone remained.  \n \nBack to Mount Washington, Yogananda’s headquarters: \nIn August 1927, in East-West, the first fruits of Mount \nWashington’s labors were happily published. Note the following \nnumbers - that's a lot of people. If they are accurate, they would be \nquite a challenge even for today. Nowadays, of course, no public \nclasses and services are held at Mount Washington anymore. \nMount Washington today is exclusively the SRF administration \ncenter. \n- Total attendance in lectures, weekly classes, special classes \nconducted at Mount Washington Education Center: 20,000.  \n- Total Sunday School attendance: 4,500. Children 1,500; Adults \n3,000 \n- Personal interviews to Yogoda students and non-students, helping \nthem with advice and prayer concerning personal problems: 2,500 \n- Prayers, help and written instructions on physical, domestic, \nmoral and spiritual problems given students and non-students (by \nmail): 4,000 \n- \nInquiries \nreceived \nand \nanswered \nrelating \nto \nYogoda \nCorrespondence Course: 4,000 \nCalls made upon sick people in Los Angeles hospitals and homes: \n500 \n- Also lectures given before well-known clubs, churches, civic \norganizations and on the radio. Numerous plays, musical recitals, \nholiday parties and other entertainments were also given. \n \nIn short: they were extremely active!

The topic they decided \nto discuss was “The history of SRF magazines.”  \n \nYogananda made another fun statement: “I sometimes think God \nmust be watching in amazement this big zoo of human beings \nhere.” Well, Andy and Serafi were two somewhat different \n“animals” of God’s big zoo, who perceived the world with very \ndifferent eyes. So at first they examined each other doubtfully, but \nthen happily sat down for a good cup of tea and a piece of cake. \nSoon they began appreciating each other’s company. Did they \n"}

But they were able to “agree to \ndisagree,” as broad-minded people do.  \n \nThey began to study the old SRF magazines. Serafi had brought an \namazing stack of them, and Andy added a few as well. Their goal \nwas to look carefully at the content and at the “feel” of the \nmagazines, to get a better understanding of SRF at various points \nof its evolution. And truly, the beauty of the old magazines is that \nthey convey the pulse and heartbeat of SRF at every point of its \nexistence. Through them, one can almost intuit the life behind the \nmonastic walls. \n \nThus immersing themselves, Andy and Serafi discovered a colorful \npanorama, a lively story, all highly interesting.  \n \nIn the beginning, Serafi was confronted with a psychological \ndifficulty: “I am so familiar with a certain way of knowing SRF, \nthrough decades of its publications, that it is hard to be open to a \nvery different SRF of earlier times. One actually has to let go of all \npersonal concepts about SRF to understand its past.” \n \nAndy, by the way, had earlier discovered two websites which \npublish parts of the old magazines. But he quickly found out that \nas historical documents they are of little value, since they had been \nedited and revised, according to the taste of the publisher. \nDhirananda, for example, a main player during the 20ies, who was \nmuch included in the early magazines, was entirely deleted. \nHistory should remain history, Andy thought, and not become part \nof organizational agendas. \n \nYogananda’s wrote a mission statement for this magazine, \npublished in an introductory “Special Notice”: \n“With this November-December 1925 issue, official organ of the \nYOGODA AND SAT-SANGA HEADQUARTERS at Mount \nWashington, Los Angeles, ‘East-West’ makes its initial bow to the \nAmerican public. Its Aim and Purpose, as outlined by Swami \nYogananda, is to inspire, to enlighten, and to encourage all to live \n"}

Andy took notes and later together they wrote up the \nfollowing study. \n \n \nHere the Magazine's History Starts: \n \nYogananda came to the West in 1920, and soon began putting the \nprinting-press to work, to get his mission started. Even before \nestablishing Mt. Washington, he had already printed Songs of the \nSoul, the Yogoda Introduction, Science of Religion, and Scientific \nHealing Affirmations. \n \nWhile on his “campaigning” tour through America in 1924, he felt \nthe time was ripe for publishing a regular magazine.  \n \nIt was in November 1924, while visiting his much-loved friend, the \n“American Saint” Luther Burbank in Santa Rosa, that the name of \nthe new magazine was created.  \n \nWe read in Autobiography of a Yogi:  \n“Luther,” I remarked, “next month I am starting a magazine to \npresent the truth-offerings of East and West. Please help me decide \non a good name for the journal.” We discussed titles for awhile, \nand finally agreed on “East-West.” After we had reentered his \nstudy, Burbank gave me an article he had written on “Science and \nCivilization.” “This will go in the first issue of East-West,” I said \ngratefully…” \n \nActually the first issues were called “East-West World Wide.” The \naddition of “World Wide”, as one reads, was Luther Burbank’s \nsuggestion. But from January 1926 it was discontinued, maybe \nbecause “East-West” already implies the concept “World Wide”. \n"}

But Brother Time often seems to refuse the desire to move \ntoo quickly: the first issue of “East-West” finally came out a year \nlater, in November 1925, just after Yogananda had dedicated his \nMt. Washington headquarters. He kept his word: Luther Burbank’s \narticle “Science and Civilization” was included in this maiden \nissue. \n \n \n \nThe Twenties \n \nWhat did Yogananda want to accomplish with his magazine “East-\nWest”?  \n• He saw that many devotees he had met in different cities would \nbenefit from this constant contact and inspiration: “My blessings to \nall my students. I will talk to you all thru the columns of this \nmagazine, and remember you each morning in my seven o'clock \nprayer, that you may persevere in your practice and know the \nsupreme joy of absolute spiritual realization.”  \n• He also saw it as an instrument to share with all, as he wrote in \nthe first issue, “universal principles for making life more \nbeautiful.”  \n• His hope was: “Let our hunger for knowledge make us forget our \nminor differences and teach us to gladly receive the truth-offerings \nof others.” His openness and universality were keenly felt in these \nmagazines. \n• And of course he saw it as a way to unite East and West, for \n“making understood the different good traits of Eastern and \nWestern life in general, through fellowship and constructive \nexchange of practical ideas (Sat-Sanga).” He wrote beautifully: \n“Let the East and West be ever ready to exchange the best in them \nand thus make life complete.” (All these quotes come from the first \nissue, describing the “Aims of East-West”) \n \n"}

So were the arts: poetry, \npaintings, musical notations. They fairly abound in the magazines \nof these early years. \n \nOn the very first page in the first issue, readers were invited to \nwrite their own contributions, or photos, and send them in for the \npublisher’s consideration.

Well, and of course this reflects perfectly the \nheartbeat of SRF (or better: Yogoda Satsanga) during these early \nyears in the West: it was all very rustic and simple. \n \nKamala writes that when she came with her mother to stay at Mt. \nWashington in Summer 1926, their room was completely empty, \nunfurnished. They had to paint it too. The “building was scarcely \noccupied, and we had our choice of dozens of rooms.” Imagine the \nbig empty house!  \n \nDurga Ma writes that still in Dec. 1929, when she moved in, “some \nof the rooms were furnished with the individual’s own furniture, \nand some were empty.” To her new room a bed and mattress was \nbrought. Yogananda personally carried a rug into her new quarters. \nLater she went to buy a dresser, a chair, and a table at a second-\nhand store. Other devotees used orange crates with planks to hold \ntheir mattress up, “and more crates for dresser and shelves.” Only \n15 or 16 devotees lived there at the time. Again, imagine the totally \ndifferent scene. Life at Mt. Washington wasn’t monastic then, \neither. The building, which wasn’t in great shape when Yogananda \nbought it, was painted for the first time only in 1933 (see Durga’s \nbook)! One gets the idea…. life was rustic!  \n \nIn May/June 1926 East-West offered space for publicity in the \nmagazine, stating that 5000 magazines had been sold, and they ran \nout.

From Nov. 1937 onwards, the magazine states Laurie Pratt \nto be its editor. In the meantime other persons filled that role: \nSalome Marckwardt, Louise Royston.  \n \nYogananda was much gone traveling, “campaigning.” Often, so \nDaya Mata writes, he mailed his articles from the city where he \nwas lecturing, even during his trip to India, via Europe and \nPalestine in 1935-36.  \n \nWhat is the over-all pulse and heartbeat of these early magazines? \nA free breath of inspiration. Openness. Youth. \n \n~~~ \n \n \n \nThe Thirties \n \nThe Thirties began on a tough and rocky path. It was the period of \nAmerica’s great economic crises.

In Jan-Mar 1932 East-West had still not \nrecovered.

From 1932 onwards Laurie Pratt (Tara \nMata) wrote many articles about the Yugas and Hindu philosophy, \nwhile she was living outside SRF. It's fun to see that in March \n1934 there was an add of Laurie Pratt as an astrologer in Atlanta, \nand later several adds for her Yuga book, published outside of \nSRF.  \nTasty and healthy recipes were now a regular East-West feature. \n \nThe magazine now offered less variety of contributors. Yogananda \nand disciples definitively contributed the main chunk of it. The arts \nwere a lesser presence, and science too, even though regularly \nthere was a column “Scientific Digest.” It seems that the tough \ntimes of the early thirties had acted as a fire which made \nYogananda focus his energies more strongly around his message. \nThe early 30ies also saw the beginning of the SRF monastic order. \nThe over-all energy changed, obviously. Maybe God helped \nYogananda to focus his energies, because if he had remained too \nall-inclusive, his work might not have been as effective.  \n \nIn May 1934 Yogananda changed the magazine’s name to Inner \nCulture, with the subtitle East-West Magazine. It went hand in \nhand with another big change: 1934 was also the year in which he \nrenamed his organization from Yogoda Sat-Sanga to Self-\nRealization-Fellowship. \n \nIn May 1937 the size of the magazine changed. It had been bigger \nthan nowadays, during the first 12 years of its existence. From now \non it was printed in the size we see still today.  \n \nThis was also the year when Yogananda added his regular \ninterpretations of the Rubaiyat.  \n \nOften during this time Daya Mata and Ananda Mata typed the \ninterpretations Yogananda dictated.  \n \n"}
{"doc": "Yogananda - Life History and Mission (216p).pdf", "page": 39, "text": " \n39 \nIn his later years Yogananda asked disciples to edit the early \narticles: often earlier East-West editors had edited them poorly, had \nchanged them, even added their own inspirations, while \nYogananda had never glanced at them a second time. So they \nneeded correction. However, the thought comes up: Yes, before \nTara Mata came back in 1936, maybe earlier editors hadn’t done a \ngreat job. So re-editing was necessary. But after 1936?  \n \nSRF published a letter by Tara, dated 1937, in which she writes \nabout her privilege to help with this wonderful book (referring to \nhis scriptural interpretations), and “my end is pure grammar, \narrangement.” In other words, she had done the editing job already. \nBack then in 1937 the Gita and Bible commentaries were still at \nthe very beginning, and the Rubaiyat was just being born. The \nmajor portions of these works came later, and were under Tara’s \neditorial wings, as the editor of the magazine. And Yogananda \nwas, as SRF writes, very happy with Tara’s work. One wonders, \nthen, why further editing was deemed needed later on. \n \nBack to the magazines: In October 1937 the subtitle changed. The \nnew name was Inner Culture- The Magazine of India. Was it a \nchange of concept, to predominantly teach the Indian way of Self-\nrealization? And indeed, soon afterwards Yogananda changed the \nsubtitle again. From April 1938 he called his magazine Inner \nCulture - For Self-Realization – maybe the better choice. \n \nAll this happened not long after Yogananda’s return from his \nnative land in late 1936. By the way, when Yogananda traveled \nthrough South-India, he met the illumined saint Ramana \nMaharishi. As Yogananda wrote, Ramana was a reader of the East-\nWest magazines, and had a stack of them in his room. So was \nprobably the Shankaracharya of Kanchipuram (one of the four \nmain spiritual leaders in India), who had met Yogananda in 1935, \nand “followed his activities ever since.”  \n \nSurely many others in India were following their spiritual \nambassador in the West. Indeed, back then, was there any other \n"}

Yogananda’s success in America was big news \nfor India, certainly. India was proud. That’s probably why \nYogananda could unashamedly request India’s Prime Minister \nJawaharlal Nehru in 1948, via cable telegram (published in the \nmagazine): “Deeply request you save half of Gandhi’s ashes, some \nfor India, some for America, to be buried beneath statues erected in \ntwo countries.” Nehru responded positively, and that’s why we \nfind part of Mahatma Gandhi’s ashes buried at Lake Shrine. Later, \nin November 1949, Yogananda went to San Francisco to meet \nNehru personally. It is interesting to see how Yogananda was at \nhome with great saints, as well as with the world’s important \npoliticians: he met the American president Calvin Coolidge, the \nPresident of Mexico Portes Gil, India’s Prime Minister Nehru, \nambassadors, Lieutenant Governors, Consul Generals. And he was \nequally at home with great artists, inventors, business people, \nnormal people, he met two Nobel Prize winners. In other words, he \nwas a man of the world. \n \nOops, we are really still in the 30ies! So: Inner Culture was \npublished monthly. Imagine the work involved. \n \nThe feeling and heartbeat of the magazine: more mature, more \nfocused, more centered around Yogananda’s teachings. Central for \nsure were his interpretations of the Bible and the Bhagavad Gita. \n \n~~~ \n \n \n \nThe Fourties \n \nThe 40ies saw many changes of the magazine.

One could rent them for a day or longer. This may \nshow two things: Firstly rooms were still vacant, and therefore \nYogananda’s band wasn’t very numerous (a fact which changed \nwith the publication of his Autobiography in 1946). Secondly, it \nmay show financial hardship, and/or wide-open arms for outside \ndevotees.  \n \nAbout the rush that started in Yogananda’s life after his \nAutobiography had been published (from the magazine, Nov.-Dec. \n1948): “…The work has expanded beyond my imagination. \nRenunciates, in a steady stream, are joining our Headquarters \nColony and our Encinitas Colony- and there is a long waiting line. \n…” The arrival of the Autobiography of a Yogi was certainly a \npivotal event for Yogananda’s work, and so he urged readers of his \nmagazine to “spread the message” by sharing with others their \ncopy of the Autobiography, or by presenting copies to their friends. \nWonderful feedback came streaming in, and Yogananda shared it \nthrough East-West. \n \nWait a moment! Why “East-West”? Hadn’t the name changed to \nInner Culture a long time ago? Yes, but in July1944, interestingly, \nYogananda changed the magazine’s name back to East-West. The \nchange lasted for only about three years, until June 1947. From \nthen on the name changed to Self-Realization Magazine. It was still \nprinted quarterly. \n \nA typical index of the magazine during the 40ies (East-West, \nApril, May, June 1945): \n– An International Language, by A.

May Thy love shine forever on the sanctuary of \nmy devotion, and may I be able to awaken Thy Love in all hearts.” \n \nThe magazines’ general pulse and heartbeat during those years: \nDynamic, joyful, and alive with new ideas. \n \n \n~~~ \n \n \nThe Fifties \n \nThe magazine witnessed the two final years of Yogananda’s \npresence on this planet. The SRF environment was quite different \nthen. Uniforms were not being used. Monks and nuns wore normal \nclothing during Yogananda’s lifetime. Imagine Daya Mata, Durga \nMa, and all the others in informal clothes. “You don’t have to wear \na uniform, robes, or saris, while I am here, that can come after I go \nto the Infinite,” Yogananda had frequently said (see Durga’s \nbook). “You’ll never be able to organize the work while Master is \nalive,” Gyanamata added.  \n \nIn the Sept.-Oct. 1950 magazine, in the printed Lake Shrine \ndedication talk, Yogananda explains that his boys “wear American \ndress, and so do I. This robe is only for spiritual occasions. I do not \nemphasize dress... Our boys and girls dress as Americans, but their \nhearts are different…”  \n \nRajarsi didn't introduce uniforms during his presidency. \n \nThey were introduced in 1959, when Daya Mata returned from \nIndia. The sisters now began to wear elegant orange saris. The \nbrothers received a Westernized outfit, also orange.  \n \nWhen Yogananda passed on, his magazine revealed divine timing: \nthe last issue during Yogananda's lifetime contained, amazingly, an \narticle titled \"The Final Experience.\" It was the last in a series of \n"}

In this issue he expanded on the words: \"And \nwhen Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy \nhands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the \nghost.\" It appeared in the March 1952 issue, the exact time when \nYogananda left for the higher planes. \n \nSurprisingly, at that time the magazine still cost 25c, just like the \nvery first issue 30 years earlier. \n \nDuring Rajarsi’s presidency (1952-1955) not many changes can be \nobserved in the magazine. The reason might be his increasing \nillness, or that he was quite happy with what his Master had \nestablished. \n \nDaya Mata was elected president in 1955. She writes that she was \nvery reluctant to fill that role of leadership, which for her was \"a \ntremendous test.\" When she was chosen by the board of directors, \nshe questioned, \"Why me?\" However, soon afterwards in India, in \nan ecstasy, Daya Mata saw the presence of Babaji (described in \nOnly Love). She mentally bowed to him, and sobbingly asked: \n\"They chose me. I am so unworthy. How could it be?\"  Babaji \nreplied sweetly, \"My child, you must not doubt your Guru. He \nspoke the truth. What he told you is true.\" In fact, Yogananda had \ntold her before his passing, “Now my work is finished. Your work \nbegins.” So she willingly shouldered the enormous task. \n \nAfter some time of her guidance, the magazine shows a few \nsignificant changes: \n \n–– \nYogananda’s \nname \nand \nsignature \nwere \nchanged \nto \n“Paramahansa,” rendering them correctly in Sanskrit. \n–– Yogananda’s “Aims and Ideals” were modified, eliminating the \nworld-brotherhood-colony ideal, which, so it was explained, \nYogananda had abandoned. \n"}
{"doc": "Yogananda - Life History and Mission (216p).pdf", "page": 45, "text": " \n45 \n–– The altars and prayers were modified, adding Krishna, flipping \nSri Yukteswar’s image, and switching Yogananda and Sri \nYukteswar’s positions – all for understandable reasons. \n \nIn the 50ies the magazine sold SRF travel altars. It is fun to see \nthose original ones with five SRF Gurus. That altar arrangement \nwas still publicly clarified (answering questions from students) in \nthe magazine in Nov./Dec 1959: “Paramahansa Yogananda \narranged himself the number and relative positions of the five \npictures that show the line of SRF-YSS gurus.” \n \nDo these changes in the magazine reflect what happened within \nSRF during that period? Maybe. Some disciples say it was indeed a \ntime of change within SRF: \n \n–– Everybody now took monastic vows. Yogananda’s monastic \norder started in 1931, but there were always devotees around at Mt. \nWashington and Encinitas who didn’t take the monastic vows, like \nDaya’s brother Richard Wright, who held high positions in SRF \nuntil 1941 (Board of Directors, in charge of offices and personnel \nat Mt. Washington, SRF treasurer); or Peggy Deitz, who was \nYogananda’s driver, and came in 1949 to live at Mt. Washington. \nThis new monastic setting was one reason why Reverend Bernard \nCole left (for an explanation by Daya, see below) \n–– All monks and nuns now received a monastic name. Yogananda \nhad given only few of them: Gyanamata, Durga Ma, Mataji, \nRajarsi Janakananda; all other devotees kept their normal names. \nDaya Mata for example had been a monastic for over 20 years, but \nnever received a monastic name from Yogananda. He called her \nFaye throughout.  \n–– Kriyananda as a headmonk wrote a set of monastic discipleship \nlessons for the monks, and renunciant lessons were now held \nregularly. In general numerous rules were added to the monastic \nlife.  \n–– During that time Kriyananda was also the head of the SRF \ncenters and wrote a set of guidelines for them. Later they were \nstrengthened to rules. \n"}
{"doc": "Yogananda - Life History and Mission (216p).pdf", "page": 46, "text": " \n46 \n–– Monastic uniforms started. \n \nDurga Ma wasn’t always in agreement with the monastic \ndevelopments: “Yogananda did not come to start a new church.\" \nShe had been close to Rajarsi for many years, who much cherished \nthe universal character of Yogananda's mission. Daya Mata in her \nbook Finding the Joy Within You explains these crossroads and \ndifferences of opinion among SRF's directors, and how they were \nresolved by a divine experience, which set the direction for SRF's \nmonastic future. Here her story is paraphrased for copyright \nreasons, her exact words can be found in her book, or in  \nhttp://www.yogananda-srf.org/tmp/py_notitle.aspx?id=1264  \n \nShe explains that when a great teacher leaves the world, it often \nhappens that different opinions arise among disciples concerning \nhow his mission should be guided from now on. Daya shares that \nsuch questions arose during discussion about the work in 1955, \nright on the morning after she became the leader. One point of \ndiscussion was if the guidance of the work should be in the hands \nof the householders or monastics. Yogananda, she continues, had \ntold them it was to be with renunciants like himself, but that \ndirective was being challenged by some of the members of the \nboard of directors. Daya found her mind troubled, as she also \nunderstood their point: true, why be bound by externals? A devotee \nis a devotee because he loves God, not because he is dressed with \nan ocher cloth. !That night she sought Yogananda's answer in deep \nmeditation and prayer. Late at night she saw her body get up from \nthe bed, walk down the hall, and enter Yogananda's room (it seems \nto have been a vision of herself). As she did so, she saw his shawl \nfluttering. She turned around, and there stood her Guru. In deep joy \nshe ran to him and knelt at his feet, exclaiming “Master, Master, \nyou are not dead you are not gone! Death has no claim on you.” \nYogananda reached down and touched her forehead. As he did so, \nDaya instantly knew the answer she had to give at the meeting the \nnext morning. Yogananda blessed her, and she saw herself once \nagain sitting upon her bed.! The next morning she met with the \ndirectors of the society, and gave the answer Yogananda had \n"}

SRF thus became centered around renunciants. \nDaya Mata had good reason to be firm:  within a very short time \nhad received the darshan and blessing from both Yogananda and \nBabaji (see above). \n \nAnother interesting point of observation is the magazine’s \n“Directory of Centers.” \n \n–– In his various SRF centers, as one could read, Yogananda had \nappointed a “conducting teacher.”  \n–– After Yogananda’s passing, in the later 50ies, that job was \nreduced to a few “Meditation counselors.”  \n–– Still later, even the center’s “Meditation counselors” \ndisappeared, as the magazine shows. Traveling monks became the \nteachers.  \n \nIn the Nov/Dec 1959 magazine one finds an announcement that \n“Sister Daya” from now on was to be called “Sister Dayamata.” \nLater she became Daya Mata. Also all other lady-disciples who \nhad known Yogananda personally too were now named “Mata.” \nAll monks remained “Brother.” \n  \nIn that same magazine, in her article about the trip to India, \nDayamata calls Brother Kriyananda respectfully “Kriyanandaji.” \nShe writes that she and Kriyananda enjoyed long talks together, \nthey lectured side by side, and she inserted his notes from their \nconversation with the Shankaracharya in her article for the \nmagazine. They traveled for months together through India, with \nDayamata’s sister, “Mataji,” and Sister Revati. Dayamata describes \nhow she enjoyed Kriyananda and Karunananda (Devi Mukkherjee) \nplaying soccer with enthusiasm and ability, and that she too tried to \nkick the ball, but got her feet entangled in her sari. Sweet to \nvisualize.  \n \nSoon (in 1960) Brother Kriyananda was announced in the \nmagazine as the new SRF vice-president, and as a member of the \nboard of directors, who had been \"close to Yogananda.\" He already \n"}

A common feature in the 30ies and 40ies were \nbook-reviews, discussing and recommending books of various \nauthors.  \n–– In the 40ies SRF advertised a list of 16 books written by Swami \nPremananda (formerly Bramachari Jotin, who joined Yogananda in \nthe late 20ies, and had been educated in the Ranchi school), and \nanother list of 11 books by Sri R.K. Das (another Indian whom \nYogananda had called to teach on his behalf, who \"founded\" and \nlead the SRF center in Indianapolis.) These books were ordered not \nfrom Mt. Washington, but directly from Sri Das’ SRF center in \nIndianapolis, and from Premananda’s SRF center in Washington \nDC.  \n–– A little jewel is found in East-West, April 1946, where a \nspiritual book of Mr. Dr. K. Samras, “formerly of the Self-\nRealization-Fellowship,” is advertised. He was still supported. \n–– After Yogananda’s passing, in the late 50ies, SRF sold apart \nfrom the regular SRF publications several important scriptures: \nPatanjali's Yoga-Sutras, Shankaracharya’s Crest Jewel of Wisdom, \nthe Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the Holy Bible. Also a \nvegetarian cookbook was sold, as well as Stories of Mukunda, a \nbook about young Yogananda written by Kriyananda. \n–– From the 60ies onward, only SRF-books were sold. “The \nofficial organ of SRF” (as the magazine had always been called) \nshowed some symptoms of contraction. \n \nGenerally speaking: the heartbeat of the magazine at that point \nseems simple, spiritually very sincere, young and light. It also \nshows SRF’s direction toward a traditional Western monastic \nsetup.  \n"}

Its \nlight has been shining on the firmament of the ages, as a redeemer \nof countless souls. Its history is filled with the most illustrious \nsaints and masters. And all of us who are part of this sacred Kriya \ntradition are bathing in their silent blessings. Kriya Yogis are \nlinked to a truly fascinating legacy.  \n \nWhen we talk about Kriya Yoga, we mostly think of Yogananda \nand his line of Kriya-Gurus: Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, \nand Sri Yukteswar.

The reason is that Kriya, the highest technique of Raja \nYoga, draws on universal, central facts of human nature. \"The law \nof Kriya Yoga is eternal.

Burn to ashes all the books on mathematics, the \nlogically-minded will always rediscover such truths; destroy all the \nsacred books on yoga, its fundamental laws will come out \nwhenever there appears a true yogi who comprises within himself \npure devotion and consequently pure knowledge.” (Sri Ananda \nMohan Lahiri, a grandson of Lahiri Mahasaya, quoted in \nAutobiography of a Yogi) \n \nKriya of course has not always been called “Kriya Yoga.” Babaji \nrenamed it “Kriya Yoga” for this age. Yogananda writes: “Kriya \nYoga is described in certain scriptures as Kabali Pranayama” (or \nKevali Pranayama, or Kevala Pranayama, according to dialect. \n“Kevala” means “alone”, referring to the Self). “Kabali Pranayama \nwas considered to be the greatest of all techniques in controlling \nprana (life force).” It scientifically leads the devotee to \nbreathlessness. “Breathlessness is deathlessness.” The result is \nCosmic Bliss. \n \n“Kriya is an ancient science,” Yogananda writes. Mahavatar Babaji \nrediscovered and clarified the technique after it had been lost in the \nDark Ages. Babaji revealed to Lahiri Mahasaya: \"The Kriya Yoga \nwhich I am giving to the world through you in this nineteenth \ncentury is a revival of the same science which Krishna gave, \nmillenniums ago, to Arjuna, and which was later known to \nPatanjali, and to Christ, St. John, St. Paul, and other disciples.\"  \n \nLet’s look at some of these world-famous Kriyaban-saints, since at \nleast we know about these parts of the Kriya-chain! \n \n \n~~~ \n \n \n"}

But again we are seeing only the \nsurface of a long invisible chain: Krishna had already taught Kriya \nin his former lifetimes. “In an earlier incarnation” he initiated \nVivasvat into Kriya Yoga, as Yogananda writes in his \nAutobiography of a Yogi, explaining a certain passage in the \nBhagavad Gita. Vivasvat in turn initiated Manu (his son), India’s \ngreat law-giver. Manu later initiated his own son Ikshwaku.  \n \nFor Westerners, these names don’t mean very much. For Hindus, \nhowever, they do.

But, Arjuna, by the long passing of time, this \nyoga was lost sight on earth.(4:2) \nI have this day informed you about that same ancient yoga (Kriya \nYoga), because you are my devotee and friend.” (4:3) \nArjuna then asks how this can be possible, since Vivasvat lived \nlong, long before Krishna.  \nKrishna replies: “Many births both you and I have passed through. \nI can remember them all, but you cannot.” (4:5) \n \nIn short: Krishna refers to the incredible antiquity of Kriya Yoga, \nand to the fact that he has been around forever, in one form or \nanother, to teach and revive it. \n \nKriya was taught again and again, but then was also always lost, \nwith the ebb and flow of the Yugas.

Who knows how \n“Hamsa” was pronounced in ancient times! Swami Vivekananda \nonce had a vision of ancient rishis reciting Sanskrit mantras, and \nsaid they sounded very different from the way they are chanted \ntoday. Yogananda writes in his Autobiography: “Ham-sa \n(pronounced hong-sau)…” In other words, he simply states that \nHam-sa is really pronounced “Hong-Sau.” Was he a Bengali \nfanatic, or was there some deeper knowledge in him? \n \nHong Sau, we said, comes to us from a very distant past. “Hamsa” \n(Hong-Sau) is already to be found in the oldest of the Vedas, the \nRig Veda (1550 BC, and earlier it was transmitted orally). It refers \nto the supreme Lord. It also stands in yoga scriptures for the Self \n(atman). Hamsa stems from the Sanskrit words “Aham-Sa,” which \nliterally mean \"I am He.\"  \n \nHamsa (Hong-Sau) is explained in ancient yoga scriptures to be the \nsound of the subtle breath itself: the entry of prana into the body \ncauses the sound “ham,” the ejection of prana out of the body the \nsound “sa.” Therefore the body itself is thought to automatically \nrecite this mantric sound 21.600 times a day. This spontaneous \nsound is widely known as “Ajapa Mantra” (unpronounced mantra), \nor “Ajapa-Gayatri,” (unpronounced Gayatri Mantra), or simply \n“Hamsa-Mantra.”  \n \nIn his Autobiography Yogananda similarly states: “Ham-sa \n(pronounced hong-sau) are two sacred Sanskrit chant words \npossessing a vibratory connection with the incoming and outgoing \nbreath. Aham-Sa is literally ‘I am He.’” \n \n"}
{"doc": "Yogananda - Life History and Mission (216p).pdf", "page": 67, "text": " \n67 \nYogananda described these mantric sounds as “sacred.” The \nancient texts agree. The “Gheranda-Samhita” instructs to recite this \npotent sound constantly, to arrive at a state of exaltation. \n \n“Aham”, when pronounced in mantric form as “Hong,” becomes a \nbija (seed) mantra, vibrating with the inhalation. Its vibration \ncorresponds, as yoga treatises teach, to the ascending current in the \nida nadi. “Sa” becomes “Sau” in mantric form, and vibrates with \nthe exhalation, and with the descending current through the pingala \nnadi.  \n \nThe ancient technique of “Hong-Sau” is meant to bring the yogi \ntowards mental calmness, helps him to withdraw his energy \ninward, and to lead him naturally toward breathlessness. In \nbreathlessness the twofold vibration of “Hong” and “Sau” \ncombines into the single omnipresent vibration, Aum. \n \nSeveral Masters and scriptures don’t teach “Hong-Sau,” but “So-\nHam.” Again, in India some yogis teach the Sanskrit version \n“Hamsa.” All traditions need to be respected, but disciples of \nYogananda should practice what their Guru taught. If his devotee \nthinks, “Maybe the official Sanskrit version, or the inverted \nversion, would be the better way to practice,” well, he might \nsimply lack a basic understanding of discipleship.  \n \nAnd if, on the other side, he thinks, “I must convert others to my \nGuru’s ‘better Mantra,’” again some understanding seems missing. \n \nAbout the ancient symbolism of Hamsa/Hong-Sau: “Hamsa” is \ntraditionally translated as “swan,” (even though literally it means \ngoose), which in ancient Indian scriptures is the vehicle of Brahma, \nthe Supreme Spirit. The swan is also said to possess the sacred \nknowledge of Brahma. The flight of the Hamsa thus symbolizes \nthe escape from the cycle of samsara (reincarnation). The swan \nalso lives on water but its feathers are not wetted by it, so similarly \na “Hong-Sau-Yogi” learns to live in this material world (maya), \nwhile being untouched by all its illusions, temptations, and traps. \n"}

He became a \nSwami only when he met Babaji, which was shortly before Lahiri's \npassing.

It was an essential part of his mission in the \nWest, given to him by his Gurus and Paramgurus. \n \nAnd indeed it was his Master, Swami Sri Yukteswar, who \nrequested him to write the book. He knew that it had been \nprophesied long ago by Lahiri Mahasaya, and that Yogananda was \nthe one to fulfill that prophecy. One reads in the Autobiography of \na Yogi: \n \n\"About fifty years after my passing,\" he (Lahiri Mahasaya) said, \n\"my life will be written because of a deep interest in yoga which \nthe West will manifest.

I had never forgotten Sri Yukteswar's request that I write the \nlife of Lahiri Mahasaya. During my stay in India I was taking \nevery opportunity of contacting direct disciples and relatives of the \nYogavatar. Recording their conversations in voluminous notes, I \nverified facts and dates, and collected photographs, old letters, and \ndocuments. My Lahiri Mahasaya portfolio began to swell; I \nrealized with dismay that ahead of me lay arduous labors in \nauthorship.\" \n \nDurga Ma writes that much of his authorship happened in \nEncinitas. Most of the time, as she relates, Yogananda wrote \nlonghand. At other times he dictated to Daya Mata’s shorthand. Or \nDaya Mata and Mataji (Daya’s sister, Ananda Mata) would \nalternate in taking dictation on the typewriter. Yogananda liked it \nwhen they read the text back to him. The typed text, as Daya Mata \nrecalls, was then given, piece after piece, to Tara Mata for editing. \nWhile writing, Yogananda would often pause, look up, and enter \nsamadhi. In this way the Autobiography of a Yogi became a book \ncharged with his superconscious vibrations. It was, Yogananda \nstated, \"my principle work in life,\" and will be “my messenger!\" \n \nThe book was completed in 1945. Yogananda obviously expected \nit to be published in early 1946: in East-West (Jan.-March 1946), \nin the 1946 New Year’s message, he urged the readers of the \nmagazine to “spread the message” by sharing with others their \ncopy of the Autobiography of a Yogi, or by presenting copies to \ntheir friends. He also announced how he would use the proceeds of \nhis book: to build the “Golden World City”(World Brotherhood \nColony) in Encinitas.  \n \nBut it took almost one more year before his masterpiece could \n"}

The problem was to find a \npublishing house for it: innovative and challenging thoughts never \ntread a smooth path. This was a pioneering work, filled with \nunheard-of yogic stories of stunning miracles. Tara Mata in fact \nhad to search for a long time. The publishing house which finally \naccepted the job was the Philosophical Library in New York. \n \nIt was definitively a challenging year for Tara Mata. Trying to get \nthe book printed, she lived away from her ashram and her guru, \nalone, in an unheated cold-water flat in New York, hitting a \nworldly environment. \"She almost died,\" Yogananda is reported to \nhave said. No wonder that later he gratefully exclaimed: \"Without \nher, the book would have never gone through.\" He expressed his \ngratitude to Tara, who was also the book's editor, on the dedication \npage of his Autobiography of a Yogi, saying that he is \"deeply \nindebted\" to her \"for her long editorial labors over the manuscript \nof this book.\" \n \nOnce it was printed, the Autobiography of a Yogi started to \"rouse \nthe world\" (using Yogananda's words), and Yogananda received, \nas he wrote, \"thousands of letters.\"  \n \nAll kinds of other wonderful feedback began streaming in: On the \nflap of the dust jacket comments from several famous persons were \nprinted. Nobel Prize winner Thomas Mann wrote Yogananda: \n\"This renewed contact with the Yogi-sphere, its mental superiority \nto material reality, and its spiritual discipline, was very instructive \nto me, and I am grateful to you for granting me some insight in this \nfascinating world.\" \n \nThe Autobiography of a Yogi soon began to conquer the globe, \ncountry after country, culture after culture. With it, a new era \nstarted for Yogananda’s mission: from now on, his was a world \naudience. As he wrote in his book: \"Many spiritually thirsty men \nand women eventually found their way to the cool waters of Kriya \nYoga. Just as in the Hindu legend, where Mother Ganges offers her \n"}

There exists a beautiful picture of him, \nproudly holding his literary jewel. \n \nAlready during Yogananda's lifetime the impact of Autobiography \nof a Yogi was stronger than his lecture tours, as he himself stated in \n1948: his Autobiography was doing “what I meagerly did while \ntraveling \nand \nlecturing \nto \nthousands.\" \nEven \ntoday, \nthe \nAutobiography of a Yogi remains Yogananda’s most important \ninstrument to reach people everywhere. It has truly become his \n“messenger!” \n \nAmazingly, still today, 65 years after its first appearance, the \nAutobiography of a Yogi is sometimes listed amongst the \nbestsellers in the spiritual field. It has been elected as one of the \n100 most important spiritual books of the last century. And it is a \nbook that will probably make even more history, if Yogananda's \nstatement will prove to be true: \"The blessed role of Kriya Yoga in \nEast and West has hardly more than just begun.\" \n \nJust think about it! Even today, without it, how many people would \nknow about Kriya Yoga? Without it, how many disciples of \nYogananda would be around? Without it, would the various Kriya \nteachers enjoy the same response they are getting from seekers?  \n \nShibindu Lahiri (the great grandson of Lahiri Mahasaya) for \nexample says that his success rests on the fame of the \nAutobiography of a Yogi. \n \nMany different editions of the Autobiography of a Yogi have been \nprinted from 1946 on.

For \nthe first few months she was actually content just to possess it, to \nhave it close to her.

Why did he work \nfor 25 years on it? \n \nOne might answer:  \n“He wanted to make his SRF mission known.” \n“He wanted spread India’s ancient yogic science of Self-\nrealization.” \n“He wanted to introduce the technique of Kriya Yoga.”  \n“He wanted to inspire the reader with God-love.” \n“He wanted to uplift the general reader.” \n\"He wanted to unite East and West.\" \n \n"}

Yogananda actually spoke of them \nhaving “twin karma.”  \n \nRajarsi, or “St. Lynn,” had been a disciple for many lifetimes. \nYogananda once wrote to him: “You are the Hindu yogi of the \nHimalayas sent as an American Prince Maharaj Yogi, to light the \nlamp of Yogoda in the groping hearts of our Western brothers.”  \n \nIn another letter he told Rajarsi lovingly: “You are my \nVivekananda.” And: “I recognize your many changing faces of the \npast.

But he was different \nfrom most millionaires: he, a high yogi, was following his karmic \nmission to put Yogananda’s work on a stable financial foundation.  \n \nRajarsi met Yogananda in Kansas in January 1932. He thus \nappeared just in perfect time, when a huge mortgage for Mt. \nWashington had to be paid, at a time when the whole of America \nwas struggling financially.

There he lead a meditation \ngroup. Whenever he could, he came to visit his Master, \nYogananda. It was always a most special occasion. Yogananda \ntook greatest pain to prepare Mt. Washington for his “beloved \nNr.1,” working hard with the other disciples to make everything as \nbeautiful and spotless as possible. Rajarsi tried to come for each \nChristmas, too.

That was the year \nGyanamata too was “scheduled” to pass on, but Yogananda, as he \nsaid, “begged God” for her life, and with His grace kept her in the \nbody for 20 more years.

With her, the communion of love \nwas purely inside. She always stood up when he entered the room, \nin silent inner contact with him. “She and I never talk, but we \nalways understand each other,” Yogananda said.

He was an energetic and highly \ntalented person, who started on a very small scale: in his garage, \nwith an investment of only $500. By the time Oliver Black retired \nfrom his business in 1952, it was valued $35 million dollars a year. \n"}

His \nwife died in 1970. \n \nOliver Black met Yogananda in 1931 at a private party. It was \ninstantaneous recognition: “I instantly recognized him for the \nspiritual giant he was.” Oliver’s life of discipleship began that day, \nand bore wonderful fruit: “He changed the whole direction of my \nlife.” \n \nIt must have been a deeply fulfilling time for Yogananda: he met \nRajarsi, Oliver Black, Daya Mata all in that same period, a time \nwhen Gyanamata moved to Mt Washington... all these shining \nstars in his spiritual heaven. \n \nOliver Black described his inner state at that time in colorful \nwords: “When I first met him (at 38 years) I was afraid to get half \na mile away from a drug store. I was a regular hypochondriac. \nTook pills for laxatives, aspirins for headaches, and probably \nwould have taken tranquilizers if they'd had them. I was a victim of \ninner pressures too, like all of my colleagues. Besides running a \nsuccessful company, I studied and taught a small philosophy class. \nWe were trying to find an answer to man's existence.” \n \nThe outward search for truth was now over. “Yogananda taught \nwhere to find it. You might say he handed me a blueprint, and I've \nbeen following it ever since.” \n \nHowever, the change Oliver Black made was not as big as \nYogananda would have liked. His dharma was different than \nRajarsi’s: for many years Yogananda encouraged Oliver Black to \nwithdraw from his business, and start teaching other truth-seekers. \n\"Yogananda kept telling me to get out of business, but I just \nwouldn't listen.\" \n \n"}

Yogananda had repeatedly \ntold him that if he did not leave his business willingly, something \nwould happen to force him into the spiritual direction. And so it \nhappened. In 1952, through a hostile stock-market takeover, Oliver \nBlack lost most of what he had built up with so much effort, and \nmost of his wealth. He still remained a moderately wealthy man, \nthough.

Dr. Lewis did, on Christmas Eve, \n1920. “What is that ‘single eye’ the Bible speaks of?” It was a \nquestion which had haunted Dr. Lewis for a long time. “Can you \nshow it to me?” Yogananda on the spot showed him the heavenly \nglory of the spiritual eye and the 1000-petal lotus.

They were practically of the same age, met \nin college, and were classmates there. They became close friends, \ntraveled together in India, visited saints, meditated, sang many \ndevotional songs to God, and founded a school and a library. \nDhirananda is described as being dutiful, service-oriented, and \nhighly knowledgeable. \n \nSananda, in his book “Mejda,” adds the fun story that back in \nIndia, Dhirananda was having troubles at home: he didn’t get the \nprivacy he needed for his meditations. So Yogananda invited him \nto his home in Gurpar Road, saying, “We both travel the same path \nwith heart and soul.” Yogananda kept Dhirananda’s presence in his \nattic room a secret, first. He lovingly shared his food with him. But \nof course Dhirananda’s presence became known to all, and he was \naccepted in the house as one of the family members. \n \nDhirananda’s family members were all disciples of Bhaduri \nMahasaya (the levitating saint). Dhirananda used to go to \nBhaduri’s meetings too, but once he joined Mukunda, he stopped \ngoing there.  \n \nSatyananda was part of that inspired circle of friends. Throughout \nhis book, he describes Yogananda as the leader of the group. \nYogananda was called “Bara (top or elder) Swami;” Dhirananda \nwas called “Meja (middle) Swami;” and Satyananda, being a few \nyears younger, “Chota (younger) Swami.” Later, however, they \ncalled Yogananda “Guruji.” \n \nUpon Yogananda’s advice, Dhirananda received initiation into \nKriya Yoga from Shastri Mahasaya (Kebalananda), and progressed \nquickly. \n \nYogananda in 1911 gave Dhirananda his orange dress, initiated \nhim into swami-hood, and gave him his monastic name, \n“Dhirananda.”  \n \n"}

In 1922 he wrote from \nBoston that one of them, Satyananda or Dhirananda, should come \nto America. Satyananda replied, no, he did not wish to go. \nYogananda was a little saddened at that. Yogananda wrote: \n“Dhirananda must come right away. Satyananda, take up the \nfortitude to direct the Ranchi school.” \n \nAs Satyananda writes, Guru Maharaj (Sri Yukteswar) “later said \nquietly and somberly that he felt that the beginning of an \ninauspicious future was connected with this journey that \nDhirananda was taking.” \n \nYogananda and Dhirananda soon started working together in \nBoston. They printed books, pamphlets, and circulars (mission \nstatements), under the name “Yogoda Shiksha Pranali.” \n \nThen, in 1924, Yogananda started his cross-country lecture tour.

Washington later, except Tara \nMata (who joined Yogananda in 1924, even before Mount \nWashington was established), and Kamala, who came in Mt. \nWashington in 1926, and who was invited there by Dhirananda. \n \nEven Durga Mata came later, in Dec. 1929; she writes that in May \n1928 “Dhirananda had left the fold of his Guru.” (A little mistake- \nshe herself later explains that it happened in 1929). All other \ndisciples, then, tell their stories about Dhirananda by what they \nthemselves have heard or read. \n \nMasters, as Yogananda explained, live a dual existence: they have \na very human side, which suffers and rejoices, and a divine one, \ndeep inside, where they are completely free in God, in bliss, never \nforgetting that everything is just a great dream. \n \nYogananda, Durga writes, bore deep love for Dhirananda. When \nDhirananda, “whom he loved so dearly,” left Mount Washington in \n1929, after having lived there for 3.5 years as the resident teacher, \nYogananda cried in pain: “My best friend has gone!” He was \nheartbroken. In a letter he once wrote: “I have given more to \nDhirananda than to anyone else.” Yogananda was so distraught \nthat he took off and went to Mexico, to forget his pain (also written \nin Durga’s book.) The disciples thought he might never return. \nKamala writes that Yogananda was away much longer than \nplanned. But “the Lord mended Master’s wounded heart.(Durga)”  \n \nThat trip turned out to be quite fruitful- Yogananda met the \nMexican president, lectured there, and wrote the chant: “Devotees \nmay come, devotees may go, but I will be Thine always…” He \nalso visited Xochimilco, which turned out to be one of the most \nbeautiful spots on earth Yogananda had seen.

Durga: “He often said that \nthe Lord brought him back (from Mexico), because the Lord had a \nboy hidden in Kansas City, in the form of Rajasi Janakananda, for \nhim to love a million times more than he could love Dhirananda.” \nYogananda wrote Rajarsi in a letter, Oct. 36: “All that I wished for \nDhirananda, I only got such disappointment, but God has fulfilled \nmany times in you.” The love and friendship between them was \ntruly divine. It is deeply touching to read about it in Durga’s book. \nYogananda wept tears of love for Rajarsi, sometimes hiding them \nwith his hands, so as not to show them. And Rajarsi, the “little \none,”, or “beloved Nr.1” knew where to respond: not on a personal \nlevel, but from soul to soul, in God. \n \nWhen Dhirananda left Mount Washington, he opened his own \nmeditation center in downtown LA. Daya Mata relates that he \nactually set up his own organization, which created a lot of \nconfusion among the LA members. She tells that this was such a \nheartbreaking moment for Yogananda that he even considered \nleaving everything, going back to India. Dhirananda had been an \nenormous pillar for Yogananda: Daya Mata states that his \ndeparture actually required a rebuilding of his society. (Daya, \ntelling the story, doesn’t mention Dhirananda’s name, but it is clear \nwho that “monk from India” was.) \n \nHowever, Dhirananda’s new organization never got off the ground. \nHis magnetism wasn’t as great as he may have believed. He \nprobably thought himself equal to Yogananda, but once he turned \naway from him, his sails were empty, so to speak, while \nYogananda continued to fill the greatest halls in America, with \nthousands and thousands of people.  \n \nDhirananda ran his meditation center until 1933, and then \n"}

But what does that mean for a devotee like him, except \nemptiness for the soul? \n \nDhirananda married in 1934. He had a son and a daughter. \n \nDhirananda could not forget Yogananda. Did his envy grow, even \nthen? Probably: in 1935, six years after leaving, he finally sued \nYogananda, claiming former institutional partnership with him. He \nwon, and collected $8,000. Congratulations! He also, in the courts, \ndeclared that Yogananda was taking sexual advantage of his young \nfemale devotees.  \n \nDhiranda rejected Yogananda ever since. Yogananda said he \nwould never forsake him. One day he remarked, talking about \nDhirananda: “No matter what he does, he will never find God \nexcept through this channel, ordained by God.” \n \nYes, Dhirananda (a Ph.D.) was much more of a scholar than \nYogananda. Yogananda openly admitted that he has never been a \ngreat scholar at all. Dhirananda’s English was better too. But what \ndoes that say?

Secondly, Dhirananda’s son, who is quite frank \nabout his father’s “many flaws,” described immoral behavior as \n“antithetical to who he was.” Third, Tara left pregnant and \nmarried. It seems probable that she married the father of her child \nMona. Who that was is unknown.  \n \nTo finish that part of Tara’s story: After returning from India, in \n1936, as Durga Ma writes, Yogananda went to San Francisco to \nconvince Tara Mata to come back to Mount Washington, to help \nhim with his books. Yogananda held her in high esteem (she too is \nneither “black” nor “white,” as some people seem to believe). He \narranged for her and Mona to live in a bungalow near Mount \nWashington. Durga, by the way, out of tact, never mentioned \nMona in her book, nor that Tara had married.  \n \nYogananda described Dhirananda as one of his two Judas’, the \nother one being Nerode. When Dhirananda left, as Daya Mata said, \nSRF (then still called Yogoda Satsanga) required rebuilding. \nNerode (an Indian who met Yogananda in the early 20ies who \nbecame his student, and who also met Dhirananda) was therefore \ninvited to be in charge of Mount Washington whenever Yogananda \nwasn’t present, which was frequently. But from the early 30ies \nYogananda mostly withdrew from lecturing, and Nerode was the \none who was sent out touring, to promote the work and the lessons. \nNerode was a good teacher, intelligent, successful, and traveled \nalmost continuously from 1932-1937. As Dhirananda, he wrote his \nown books, which SRF published. Nerode married an American \nlady in 1931 (there is a film of Yogananda celebrating that \nmarriage), and they had one son.  \n \nIn 1939 Nerode too left and sued Yogananda heavily for $500.000 \n"}

But Yogananda had learned his \nlesson ten years earlier, with Dhirananda: he had Nerode (and \nmaybe others) sign a paper back then, in 1929, which declared that \nhe was working as a volunteer. That paper saved Yogananda. \nNerode lost the case. Much worse, however , was that Nerode \naccused Yogananda’s morality even more than Dhirananda had. \nHe accused Yogananda of pretty bad sexual misconduct, of having \nyoung girls at all hours in his room on the top floor, while he kept \nthe older women on the floor below. \n \nThis was certainly no small thing: Nerode was well-respected \nteacher. Devotees (maybe still today, when they read these things) \ngot shaken in their love and trust, in their discipleship to \nYogananda.  \n \nIsn’t it amazing how low good devotees can sink when maya \nblinds and squeezes them? Of course the easiest and most effective \nway to attack an opponent legally is a clamorous sexual scandal. \nThat’s what Dhirananda and Nerode did with Yogananda.  \n \nHere is a broader understanding of the Dhirananda story: Yes, \nYogananda called Dhirananda a Judas. But did he ever reject him \nin his heart? Did Yogananda’s love end for him, his concern for \nhim, his loyalty? No, his love is unconditional, and that’s the \ndifference to most of us. When we say “Judas,” we easily reject, \nour love usually ends, we might get angry, or completely push that \nperson out of our lives. That's why Dhirananda is not much known \ntoday. The Master, however, even though the disciple may indeed \nhave acted like a Judas, never stops seeing him for who he is: an \nangel of God, whom he loves. Thus Yogananda sent Dhirananda a \nbox of mangoes every year for Christmas, as a gesture of his \nunconditional and undying friendship, but Dhirananda sent it back \neach time, unopened. The guru’s love is eternal, the disciple’s love \nis often fickle.  \n \nAmazingly, Yogananda had known for a long time what would \n"}

Even as a boy he said to his closest \nfriend Tulsi Bose: “One day Bagchi (Dhirananda) will betray me \nand marry a white woman.” Isn’t it amazing that Yogananda still \nlet him in the door, and gave him all he could? He also related that \nDhirananda had already betrayed him badly in another lifetime. \nBut the Master’s love is divine, ongoing. \n \nAnd so the drama will go on and on. Who knows what the next \nlifetime will bring? Again Yogananda, as a divine messenger, will \nbring light and love to the world, and again people will try to pull \nhim down, will throw dirt at him, will betray him, will \nmisunderstand him.

And thus, one by one, the disciples will find their final \nrelease in God.  \n \nThe best thing, it seems, is to learn from Dhirananda's story, so that \nwe ourselves don’t stumble and suffer more than necessary.

So was Mt. Washington: in his printed Lake Shrine \ndedication talk Yogananda stated that \"we have started trial \ncolonies at Encinitas and at Mt. Washington in Los Angeles, and \nwe have some colonies in India too. Ours is not a church in the \nordinary sense.\" \n \nMonastics and non-monastics lived in these places. And Encinitas, \nwe read, was supposed to serve as a model for other SRF colonies.  \n \nYogananda's Lake Shrine dedication talk (1950) is recorded, and in \nit he says: “I am not starting churches and other new cults. I don't \nbelieve in it!” And, “The greatest thing in the church movement is \nthe building of colonies!” If that was his conviction, wouldn’t he \nhave wanted his organization to run them?  \n \nMaybe, but maybe not. True, he included the Colonies as part of \nhis SRF Aims and Ideals, which were printed in that form until \n1958.  Still, could it be that Yogananda changed his mind for a \nspecific reason?

On the other hand Yogananda told Kriyananda \nrepeatedly, and so did Rajarsi in 1954, that \"you have a great work \nto do,\" which Kriyananda understood to be the building of \ncolonies. Kriyananda had vowed to do so already during \nYogananda's lifetime, when he heard his Guru talk with intense \npower about the need for them (as reported in the SRF magazine). \nIn this way two separate works began to flourish, not always \nwithout difficulties.  \n"}

However, if historians can be trusted, the Druids came \nto Britain much later, in about 300BC. If those ancient Druids \nindeed used Stonehenge for their ceremonies, they must have \ninherited the site. \n \nToday Stonehenge, situated on the Salisbury plain, in Wiltshire, \nSouthern England, is called a \"British Bronze Age monument.\" Sri \nYukteswar’s Yuga system, however, paints a different picture: \nStonehenge was part of a more highly developed civilization than \nours.

Yogananda told him similarly: “You \nwill find God at the end of your life!” \n \nAccording to the epic Mahabharata which describes the conflict \nbetween the Pandavas and Kauravas, Krishna ‘s death marked the \nbeginning of Kali Yuga. Krishna and Arjuna, then, using Sri \nYukteswar’s calculation, died (and lived, therefore) about 2700 \nyears ago, around 700 BC. So we assume Arjuna’s lifetime to have \nbeen from about 760–700 BC. \n \nA bit more history: Not long afterwards, around 560 BC, Gautama \nBuddha was born, an avatar, whose reforms of Hinduism resulted \nin the Buddhist religion. He had, as Yogananda wrote “many \nliberated disciples.” \n \nAdi Shankaracharya (Shankara), it is usually taught was born \naround 700AD. The presently living Shankaracharyas, however, \nclaim to possess records in their “math” (monastery), showing all \nthe representatives of Shankara (the Shankaracharyas) throughout \nthe centuries, leading to Adi Shankaracharya’s birth in 500BC. \nYogananda doesn’t solve the dispute in his Autobiography: “A few \n"}

Shankara is known as the foremost exponent of the \nAdvaita Vedanta philosophy: “Only one exists, Sat-chit-ananda, all \nelse is illusion!” He united many conflicting religious sects under \none philosophical “umbrella”, which included (unknown to many) \nboth Gyana and Bhakti Yoga, both the “Only One” concept, and \nthe “I And You” relationship, as a step to that One-ness. Shankara \nsucceeded in unifying India spiritually. \n \nYogananda mentions Shankara many times in his Autobiography, \nin his talks and writings. He must have felt a deep inner connection \nwith him. When Yogananda became a Swami in 1915, he chanted \na hymn of Shankara. Also it was the ancient Srinagar temple of \nSwami Shankara, which transformed itself in Yogananda’s vision \ninto his Mount Washington headquarters. Yogananda, in addition, \ntold many stories about Shankara’s life, some of which are not \ngenerally known. For example, he told the story of a black \nmagician who wanted to execute Shankara; he told how a woman \ndisciple of Shankara died because of her doubts; and he told the \nstory of how Shankara received Kriya Yoga initiation from \nMahavatar Babaji.  \n \nYogananda himself, as he stated (in Durga Ma's book), was in truth \na disciple of Babaji. Sri Yukteswar, he explained, was his guru “by \nproxy.” Could it be that Yogananda and Shankara had been brother \nKriyabans, at the feet of Babaji? \n \nIf so, Yogananda lived with Shankara, around 700AD. A certain \ndevotee had a vision, in which he saw that Yogananda actually was \nShankara. Who can tell?  \n \nA sidelight: isn’t it a surprising? Babaji was Yogananda’s real \nGuru.

Indians, however, traditionally \ncalculate their history in millions of years, and think of history as \ncyclical movements between higher and lower ages: the Yugas. Sri \nYukteswar, as we know, taught that type of history too, but came \nup with his own unorthodox Yuga-calculations. \n \nIf the Indian concept is true, we find ourselves standing in front of \na fathomless depth of history: of countless civilizations, \nadventures, and saints. Arjuna and Krishna, according to Indian \ntradition, are said to have been, in their earlier lives, the ancient \nrishis Nara and Narayana. They are said to have lived in Satya \nYuga, which according to Sri Yukteswar ranges from 16300–6700 \nBC (both ascending and descending parts). \n \nAnd before that? One wonders how far back into unknown history \nBabaji’s and Yogananda’s incarnations reach, as saints. One \ndisciple of Yogananda, Norman Paulsen, saw himself in a vision \nwith Yogananda in Lemuria, eighty thousand years ago: over 3 \nyugas ago! \n \n \n~~~ \n \n \n"}

Elisha lived \nduring the reign of King Achab (875-845 BC).  \n \nIt's an intriguing story: in his original Bible interpretations \nYogananda wrote that the great prophet Elijah (Elias, John) was \nmore highly developed than Elisha (Jesus), but then he fell, and \nlater, as John, he found liberation through the ordeal of being \nbeheaded. “Sometimes the Guru-Preceptor falls down, only to be \nlifted up by the advanced disciple, as Jesus uplifted the fallen \nElias, or John the Baptist, who could only baptize with water.”  \n \nInterestingly also, Yogananda said (in Man’s Eternal Quest) that \nJesus attained most of his perfection in his former incarnation as \nElisha. And soon afterwards came the time when Arjuna found \nliberation.  \n \nFollowing this wild thread of thought, we see that the timing would \nactually make sense for Yogananda’s evolution:  \n• As Elisha he attained most of his perfection (around 850 BC). \nHer surpassed Elias. \n• As Arjuna he found liberation (around 700BC).  \n• As Jesus he came as an avatar. (0 AD). In this life Elias, now \nJohn the Baptist, found liberation too, as Yogananda wrote. \n \nA further interesting fact is that Elijah (or Elias; John) was a Kriya \nmaster, as Yogananda states in his Autobiography. He certainly \ntaught it to his disciple Elisha (or Eliseus; Jesus). \n \nThis would take us to the following picture: \n• As Elisha, Yogananda practiced Kriya. \n• As Arjuna he practiced Kriya too, surely, since Krishna taught it \n(see Autobiography). \n• Shankara practiced Kriya and, as we saw, Yogananda might have \nbeen close to him, practicing Kriya too. \n• As Jesus too he knew Kriya (see Autobiography), and taught it. \n"}

He \ndescribed many unknown occurrences, like “although Jesus was so \ngreat, he often allowed John, his beloved disciple, to lean on his \nbreast.” \n \nThinking about the “Jesus=Yogananda” possibility, some may ask \nhow Yogananda could ever be Jesus? When Jesus appeared to \nYogananda, did he appear to himself? How is that possible? \nHowever, we also know that Yogananda had visions of Krishna, \nwhose soul had already gone on, to live in the body of Babaji. Still \nKrishna became alive for Yogananda, and communicated with \nhim. Is it possible that an avatar may keep his former individuality \nalive, even while his soul is gone to another incarnation?  \n \nJesus, according to Yogananda, lived in India and Tibet during his \n“lost 18 years,” which are the major part of his life. The Bible \ndoesn’t say a single word about all those missing years. \nYogananda referred positively to the book The Unknown Life of \nChrist by Nicholas Notovitch, who found ancient scrolls in a \nTibetan monastery which describe Jesus’ life in India. Jesus was \ncalled “Isa” then. The script describes Isa’s visit to India during the \nexact time of his disappearance from Asia Minor.

At the tomb one finds \nchiseled footprints with markings of nail holes. Also the Kashmiri \ntext Bhavishya Maha Purana (115AD) tells about the king of \nKashmir, Shali-Vahana (about AD 80), who met a foreigner, a \ndistinguished person wearing white robe, at Wien, a place near \nSrinigar. The foreigner called himself Ishvara Putaram (Son of \nGod), Isha Masih (Jesus Messiah), and Kanya Garbam (Born of a \nVirgin). He said: “I appeared as Isha-Saih (Jesus Messiah). I \nreceived the Messiah-hood, (Christ-hood) in the land of the \nMleechas (Amalekites, Israel).” \n \nWhat did Yogananda have to say on the topic? \n \nNothing. But what makes one suspicious is that in his detailed \nBible interpretations, Yogananda never mentions Jesus’ final \nbodily ascension, 40 days after his appearance to the apostles, even \nthough it is quite an important part of Christian dogma. He talks \nabout everything else: the immaculate conception (being true), \nabout Jesus’ miracles (being true), his crucifixion, about his \nascension (in consciousness) through the three worlds to the \nFather, his miraculous resurrection after three days, his appearance \nto the disciples for 40 days… but nothing about the bodily \nascension afterwards.  \n \nIndeed, could a physical body even enter into the astral or causal \nworld, or into the kingdom of God? It would fall right down!

Do you know my brother and I, as children, \nused to plan an invasion of England? And I could have done it too, \nbecause I had done it before.” \n \nA bit of Norman history: William the Conqueror was a descendant \nof the Viking Rollo, who had invaded Normandy in 886AD. After \n30 years of war with the King of France, Charles, they made peace. \nRollo married the daughter of Charles and converted to \nChristianity. Normandy became a pretty independent duchy of the \nKing of France. 150 years later William was born and became the \n7th duke of Normandy. \n \nWilliam was destined to become also the king of England: the \nmost famous and most discussed medieval king, and probably the \nmost misunderstood of all. \n \nIndeed, it is quite difficult to grasp the greatness of William, \nhidden behind the strange role he had to play. When reading \nhistorical texts, we are informed about outer facts, which often \nsound appalling, but we can't easily understand the deeper, divine \nwill behind it, nor the deeper nature of the saint involved. Thus \nYogananda wrote in his Autobiography: \"Like all biographical \nsketches, [Sri Yukteswar's] words had given the outward facts \nwithout revealing the inner man.\" In truth, with William the divine \nLight had descended onto earth. It was a Light destined to fulfill an \nunusual mission. \n \nWilliam was an illegitimate child, and therefore he was branded \n\"bastard\" by those who didn't like him. His father was Duke \n\"Robert the Magnificent,\" also called, for wrong reasons, \"the \ndevil.\" His mother was Herleva, the beautiful daughter of simple \ntanner, also popularly called Arlette from Falaise. Arlette had had a \nprophetic dream when she was pregnant with William: a mighty \ntree grew out of her womb, growing taller and taller, until it \n"}

The tree growing was indeed \nmighty – it was God's own tree. \n \nIt is also told that when William was just born, in the castle of his \nfather in Falaise, his very first act was to grasp a handful of straw, \nand hold it so tightly that the nurse could scarcely take it away \nfrom him. She intuitively understood this to be an omen, and \npredicted that the baby would grow up and make himself famous \nby seizing great territories. This prophecy proved to be true too. \n \nYogananda also, when a little child in his mother's arms, received a \nprophecy from Lahiri Mahasaya: \"Little mother, thy son will be a \nyogi. As a spiritual engine, he will carry many souls to God’s \nkingdom.\" Yogananda's was to be a spiritual role, while William's \nmission concerned power, politics, dharma. God intervenes also in \nthe political world: an interesting thought to ponder. \n \nYogananda was William's \"heir.\" He too showed considerable \npower, not only sweetness. He was lovable, we all know that. Yet \nhe also emanated astonishing power. Just listening to his voice on a \nrecording is enough to make the point. Resounding clearly in that \nvoice is not a gentle lamb, but the mighty roar of a spiritual \nwarrior. \n \nWilliam became the king of England, and changed Europe's \nhistory forever. His life has been described as a blazing comet \nentering the planet. Michael H. Hart, in his known book The 100: \nA Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History places \nWilliam on rank 68. In the heavenly eyes, William's life was \nprobably much more highly placed, for reasons hard to decipher. \nWilliam lived at the crossroads of history, and probably set \nimportant tracks for mankind. Historians call the period from \n500AD-1100AD the \"dark age\" of the middle ages. The time after \nthat marks the most enlightened phase of medieval times. Just \nduring the moment of transition towards that higher historical \nphase William made his appearance. (Indeed, often the years prior \n"}

Davis (a foremost historian on the \nsubject), \"raised the English to that level of culture which the \ncontinental people had already reached,... to make England in her \nturn a leader among nations.\" \n \nEnglish-written history, of course, doesn’t describe William in a \nfavorable light at all. He is rather described as a villain of history, \nmuch slandered and sullied. And it is apparent why. We all have \nour national pride. The English are known for being especially \npatriotic, a feeling which was deeply offended by William, a mere \nDuke of Normandy, who was presumptuous enough to invade and \nconquer their English motherland. In fact, would anybody of us \neasily swallow that, if it happened to our own country? And would \nour own historians paint a beautiful picture of such an intruder? \nMany nasty legends were told about William, and were colorfully \nembellished over the years. England and France, furthermore, had \nlong been bitter rivals. William thus became widely known as a \nman of avarice, guile, and ruthlessness.  \n \nTo understand William we need to understand the times he lived \nin. He had a divine mission to fulfill for ushering in a new cycle in \nhistory. These were cruel times, indeed barbaric. As we said, \nhistorians call that period the \"dark age\" of the middle ages. A \nnormal moral man of that time would today be considered \ndangerous. Everywhere one found killing, poisoning, cruelty. Had \nWilliam just said smilingly, \"Be in peace, dear brothers, and love \neach other,\" they would have cut off his smiling head right away. \nHe had to use appropriate means for those times, which nowadays \nare hard to understand. \n \nIn modern times, after almost 1000 years, more realistic books \nhave been published about William, by highly respected historians. \nThe best known is William the Conqueror, by David C.

Norman history tells a very different tale, of course. \nHere’s the story of the famous Norman conquest:  \n \nIn January 1066 the English king Edward (a half-uncle of William, \na saint, canonized, and truly loved by his people), childless, had \njust died. In 1051 he had promised the English throne to William. \nBut Harold Godwinson (Edward's brother-in-law, and the most \npowerful earl and minister) claimed that a few days before his \ndeath, King Edward had changed his mind and conferred the \ncrown to him (if that is true, nobody will ever know). An \nauthoritative counsel, called the Witan, declared Harold to be the \nking. Harold, with remarkable speed, had himself be crowned. He \nhad, however, only two years earlier (in 1064) sworn on holy relics \nthat he would uphold William’s claim to the English throne (under \npressure, the English say). But Harold broke this promise. He now \ndeclared to have higher duties to follow. For Norman eyes this \nperjury could have no other consequence than the invasion of \nEngland. Massive activity followed: William gathered forces, \nallies, and built huge amounts of ships. He received support for his \ninvasion from Pope Alexander II, and received a papal banner to \ncarry into battle. \n \nAccording to Orderic Vitalis and William of Malmesbury, Harold's \nbrother Gyrth tried to prevent him from engaging William in \nbattle, urging his brother not to break the oath which he had sworn \nto William confirming the latter's succession. Harold, however, \n"}
{"doc": "Yogananda - Life History and Mission (216p).pdf", "page": 160, "text": " \n160\nhad ignored Gyrth's advice. Friends and brothers, and even his own \nmother, tried to stop Harold. Gyrth, told Harold (Orderic Vitalis): \n\"Reflect also, in your wisdom, on the oath you have taken to the \nduke of Normandy. Beware of incurring the guilt of perjury, lest \nby so great a crime you draw ruin on yourself and the forces of this \nnation, and stain for ever the honor of our own race.\" But Harold \nwas angered by these advices. (Still Orderic Vitalis): \"Holding in \ncontempt the wholesome advice of his friends, he loaded his \nbrother with reproaches for his faithful counsel, and even forgot \nhimself so far as to kick his mother when she hung about him in \nher too great anxiety to detain him with her.\"  \n \nThese words of strong warning to Harold, from all sides, of \nrefusing wise counsel, sound much like the advice given to \nDuryodhana, who was the evil and power-hungry enemy of Arjuna \nand his brothers, the Pandavas, during the battle of Kurukshetra, \ntold in the Mahabharata.  \n \nTalking about Arjuna and William, two of Yogananda's previous \nlifetimes: of both one reads the same story, that nobody but \nthemselves was strong enough to use their bow. Both were \nextraordinarily strong, physically. Yogananda was too, as he \nsometimes demonstrated. \n \nThose medieval times were terrible, but also full with signs and \nwonders: in April 1066, for one entire week, an unusually bright \ncomet with blazing tail was seen in the sky (depicted also in the \nfamous Bayeux tapestry). It was deemed to be a heavenly omen. \nMaterialists today laugh at those \"omens\", but Shakespeare wrote: \n\"When beggars die there are no comets seen. The heavens \nthemselves blaze forth the death of princes.\"  \n \nSo William crossed the English Channel in late September1066 \nAD to fight Harold, conquered England, and became one of the \nmost famous figures in history for winning the Battle of Hastings. \nWilliam’s invasion was a massive risk, with everything to lose if \nhe was unsuccessful.

William used his time of waiting in \nfrequent prayer. God was ever his polestar. Orderic Vitalis (an \nEnglish monk-historian) wrote: \"Duke William and the whole \narmy committed themselves to God's protection, with prayers, and \nofferings, and vows, and accompanied a procession from the \nchurch, carrying the relics of St. Valeri, confessor of Christ, to \nobtain a favorable wind.\" When they finally could sail, William \nlost, due to rough storms, quite some ships and soldiers. Many saw \nin it an ill omen. But William the Conqueror had an indomitable \nwill which could never be discouraged. \"The stronger the will, the \nstronger the energy,\" Yogananda used to teach in this life too. \n \nAn incident very revealing of the duke’s character occurred when \nthey were sailing across the Channel. The Mora, William’s ship, \nlost contact with the rest of the fleet which threw some of the \nduke’s crew into a state of fear. William’s response was to order \ncalmly dinner to be served. He sat down pleasantly to eat with \ngreat relish, as if he were in a room in his house at home. He was a \ntrue leader, leading his men in any given situation. In time, the rest \nof the fleet caught up with the duke’s ship, and the rest of the \njourney was smooth.  \n \nThe famous story is told that when William landed at Hastings, the \nfirst thing that happened was that he stumbled and fell on the \nground. A shock went through the army – they saw another ill-\nomen. But William at that moment showed his strength, character, \nand excellent leadership. He rose vigorously and exclaimed with a \nloud voice: ”So determined am I to conquer this land that, lo, I \nhave grasped it with both hands.” A cheer of victory came from the \narmy.  \n \nYogananda too always had the strong charisma of a leader, already \nas a boy. As a young man he was approached and asked if we \nwouldn't lead a revolution against the English, to free India. But \nthat wasn't Yogananda's dharma in this lifetime. He answered: \n"}

Harold had been waiting for months at the \ncost for his attack, ready to fight with the most fierce warriors of \nEurope, as the Saxons were known, with their terrible battle axes. \nBut waiting for months, he finally couldn't hold his soldiers \ntogether. They disbanded. William's organization was better: the \nduke, waiting also, on the other side of the Channel, \"utterly \nforbade pillage\", writes William Poitier, one of his biographers. \n\"He made generous provisions both for his own knights and for \nthose from other parts, but he did not allow any of them to take \ntheir sustenance by force. The flocks and herds of the peasantry \npastured unharmed throughout the providence. The crops waited \nundisturbed for the sickle without either being trampled by the \nknights in their pride, or ravaged out of greed by plunderers. A \nweak and unarmed man might watch the swarm of soldiers without \nfear, following his horse singing where he would.\" \n \nThe long time of waiting was fortunate for William also for \nanother reason. At a certain point, Harold had to march North with \nhis army, to fight against King Harald Hardrada of Norway, who \nwas invading England with the help of Tostig, Harold’s own \nbrother. Harold won that battle brilliantly at Stamford Bridge, but \nalso lost many soldiers. Two days after his victory Harold heard \nthat William had landed in England. Harold immediately marched \ndown South to meet William. His soldiers were confident after \ntheir recent victory, but certainly they were also tired and less \nnumerous. William, who had expected to fight directly after \nlanding, waited. He actually organized a happy feast for his \nsoldiers, depicted on the famous Bayeaux tapestry. \n \nWhen Harold was on his way South to meet William the \nConqueror, an inauspicious omen was waiting for him.

Thus he re-founded the church now known as Waltham \nAbbey. Now, just before the battle of Hastings, he paused here for \nprayer. But the black Abbey crucifix, the very same one which \nonce had healed Harold of paralysis, this time miraculously bowed \nits head, refusing to look at him. Quite understandably, this was \nregarded as a strong ill omen. Harold was marching into his dark \nfate, and God knew. (Waltham Abbey continued to be regarded as \na healing shrine, and here Harold was eventually buried.) \n \nWhen William heard that Harold was approaching Hastings with \nhis army, he prepared himself spiritually, as Orderic Vitalis writes: \n\"He then heard mass, strengthening both body and soul by \npartaking of the consecrated host; he also reverently suspended \nfrom his neck the holy relies on which Harold had sworn. Many of \nthe clergy had followed the Norman army, among whom were two \nbishops, Odo, of Bayeus, and Geoffrey of Coutances, with \nattendant clerks and monks, whose duty it was to aid the war with \ntheir gravers and counsels. \n \nWhen Harold came close, he and William exchanged messages, \nboth telling the other to avoid the battle by retreating and accepting \nthe right of the other. None accepted. William then sent a message \nto Harold offering to submit their rival claims to the test of law. \nHarold spurned the proposal. Then William asked Harold to spare \nthe blood of countless soldiers, by fighting a one-on-one battle. But \nHarold didn’t accept the challenge – small wonder, since William \nwas known to be amazingly strong. So the battle began on October \n14. \n \nHarold didn’t attack. He positioned himself to his tremendous \nadvantage on top of a hill, called Senlac Hill, so that the Normans \nhad to fight uphill, while the Saxons had an enormously strong line \nof protection with their shields. Normans used horses, Saxons \ndidn’t. William fought on a magnificent warhorse, a gift from King \nAlfonso from Spain.  \n \n"}

At a certain point the Saxons shouted, \n“William is dead.” The Normans were terrified, and retreated. The \nSaxons stormed after them. It is a famous moment: William took \noff his helmet, galloping to the scene, shouting, “I am here, I am \nhere!” At this point the Normans turned around, and attacked. The \nSaxons, before so solidly arranged for battle, were now quite \nscattered, and suffered serious losses. Many historians think that \nthis moment was actually pre-meditated, because William used \nthat tactic soon again, and had used it before. His strategies were \nknown to be brilliant. He finally won that battle in that same way: \nagain he had his soldiers attack and suddenly turn around, \npretending to escape. The Saxon soldiers, who stood solid and \nstrong until that point, saw victory and stormed after them. In that \nmoment William’s soldiers turned around, and overran the \nbewildered and unprotected enemies. In all that, William himself \nwas never in the safe background. That wasn’t his temperament.  \n \nAnother decisive stroke for winning the battle were William's \narchers (William's specialty, a characteristic brought over from his \nlife as Arjuna.) \n \nWilliam of Poitiers, who wrote William’s life and knew him \nclosely, wrote: “Duke William excelled both in bravery and \nsoldier-craft.

William \nwas a noble general, inspiring courage, sharing danger, more often \ncommanding men to follow than urging them on from the rear. The \nenemy (at the Battle of Hastings) lost heart at the mere sight of this \nmarvelous and terrible knight. Three horses were killed under him. \nThree times he leapt to his feet. Shields, helmets, hauberks were \ncut by his furious and flashing blade, while yet other attackers \nwere clouted by his own shield.” \n \nThe Normans prevailed.

This gesture shows \nWilliam to be a man of dharma, of right action, even in the midst \nof war. \n \n14 October 1066 is a day history will never forget, and Hastings is \nsaid to have maybe been the most important battle in English \nhistory. The victory was William’s. Still it wasn’t a happy day for \nhim.

Until 1071 he had to fight against many \nrebellions, he reacted in fierce manner, and finally won.  \n \nModern historians tell us that it is extremely difficult for our \nmodern mind to understand these early medieval times and \ncircumstances, and to judge things intelligently: why and how \nthings were done. Our modern yardstick of judgment is not \nappropriate. It is useless to project onto the people of William's \nday our modern sentiments and thoughts. William had no chance \nother than to act appropriately for his barbaric times. \n \nFor example, it is easy to criticize William for cutting off people's \nhands. No other king, however, would have been as lenient: the \nnormal procedure under the same circumstances was to kill the \noffenders right away. To be any more lenient than that would \nactually have cost him the respect of his enemies, and made it \nimpossible for him to rule.

But this (as in all other such cases) was a military \nstrategy, as opposed to simply letting his men loose to scavenge \nand pillage as they chose. William knew Harold to be impetuous. \nKnowing full well that his army was now within Harold’s own \nearldom of Wessex, the duke wanted to provoke an immediate \nattack. William needed to fight soon, otherwise his provisions \nwouldn’t last for his big army. \n \nYogananda was once asked, referring to his tough life as William, \nwith all these bloody battles to confront: “Is it possible, Sir, for a \nliberated master not to live in a state of samadhi?” He replied: \n“One never loses the awareness that he is inwardly free.” \n \nWilliam formed the destiny of England. The Anglo-Saxon way of \nlife had finished forever. A new era started.

As a system of \ngovernment, the English is the oldest in the world (discounting \npossibly the Vatican).

William also \nbuilt the Windsor Castle. Today, as one of the Queen's official \nresidences, Windsor Castle still plays a formal role in State and \nofficial occasions. The famous Tower of London (‘White Tower’) \nwas built by William: For over 900 years the Tower has dominated \nthe city of London and today is still one of the capital's most \nprominent landmarks and a world famous visitor attraction.

This King \nWilliam...was a very wise and great man, and more honored and \nmore powerful than any of his predecessors. He was mild to those \ngood men who loved God, but severe beyond measure to those \nwho withstood his will. He founded a noble monastery [Battle \nAbbey] on the spot where God permitted him to conquer England, \nand he established monks in it, and he made it very rich. In his \ndays the great monastery at Canterbury was built, and many others \nalso throughout England; moreover, this land was filled with \nmonks who lived after the rule of St. Benedict; and such was the \nstate of religion in his days that all who would, might observe that \nwhich was prescribed by their respective orders. \nKing William was also held in much reverence. He wore his crown \nthree times every year when he was in England: at Easter he wore \nit at Winchester, at Pentecost at Westminster, and at Christmas at \nGloucester.

He removed bishops from their sees and \nabbots from their offices, and he imprisoned thanes, and at length \nhe spared not his own [half-]brother Odo. This Odo was a very \npowerful bishop in Normandy. His see was that of Bayeux, and he \nwas foremost to serve the king. He had an earldom in England, and \nwhen William was in Normandy he [Odo] was the first man in this \ncountry, and him did William cast into prison. \nAmongst other things, the good order that William established is \nnot to be forgotten.

The land of the Britons [Wales] was under \nhis sway, and he built castles therein; moreover he had full \ndominion over the Isle of Man; Scotland was also subject to him...; \nthe land of Normandy was his by inheritance, and he possessed the \nearldom of Maine, and had he lived two years longer, he would \nhave subdued Ireland by his prowess, and that without a battle. \nTruely there was much trouble in these times, and very great \ndistress.

How can they, \nfrom that perspective, understand what it takes to rule? Kings and \nqueens have to act in ways that would be wholly different from the \nway of the monk or the scholar, which is why the latter don't often \nhave the karma to be kings or queens. \n \nModern historians too write of William's avarice.

He was great in body and strong, tall in stature \nbut not ungainly. He was also temperate in eating and drinking. \nEspecially was he moderate in drinking, for he abhorred \ndrunkenness in all men, and disdained it more particularly in \nhimself and at his court.

He followed the Christian discipline \nin which he had been brought up as a child, and whenever his \nhealth permitted he regularly and with great piety attended \nChristian worship each morning and evening, and at the \ncelebration of mass.\" \n \n William was famously abstemious in food and drink and he \nparticularly abhorred drunkenness. He was a man of known self-\ncontrol, also concerning women. Regarding his corpulence in his \nlater years, we must consider the possibility of a medical condition \nwhich contributed to it. This possibility makes far more sense than \nconcluding that William suddenly changed the habits of a lifetime, \nby starting to eat without being able to control himself. \n \nWilliam also furthered art and music. Normandy was the site of \nseveral important developments in the history of Western music in \nthe eleventh century.

Their texts are usually discredited as \nbeing exaggerated and as being merely Norman propaganda. But \nfor us it is more reasonable to think that even these \"disciples\" \ndidn't even fully grasp the greatness of William the Conqueror. He \nwas even more, beyond their words of praise and admiration.

Another great player in the team was the famous St. \nAnselm, disciple of Lanfranc. William built countless monasteries \nand churches in Normandy and England. Religious life flourished. \nBuilding monasteries almost became a fashion with the barons. \nDouglas writes about this \"ecclesiastical revival\" as being almost \nas important as the political achievements of Duke William. \nConcerning building, Yogananda once said: “From childhood I \nwas interested in creating buildings.

The \nearliest version of it has been found in William's breviary. (See \nbook by the Franciscan priest Albert Haase, \"INSTRUMENTS OF \nCHRIST, Reflections on the Peace Prayer of Saint Francis of \nAssisi\").

Doesn't this fact alone speak volumes about his \n\"cruelty\"? Which other king behaved like this, in those days? \n \nWilliam actually legally abolished capital punishment (imagine: in \nthat medieval time)! His law established: \"I also forbid that anyone \nshall be slain or hanged for any fault, but let his eyes be put out \nand let him be castrated.\" The punishment sounds crude and cruel \nto modern ears, of course, but for those dark times it was probably \nrevolutionary– and convicted criminals were must have been \ngrateful to hang on to life. \n \nWilliam also legally put an end to slavery, which had still been \npracticed in Saxon England. His laws forbade it. Another fact \nwhich speaks volumes about his character. He was a man of \ndharma, of principles, of righteousness, and absolutely strict in \nmaking sure it would be followed. \n \nThe sheer energy and one-pointed determination of William \nscarcely need comment. Throughout his life, he responded to one \ncrisis after another, forever jumping into action. His energy was \nextraordinary, to say the least. Yogananda too, was a man of \nenergy without end. His \"conquest\" was the Western world, where \nhe too never stopped until victory was achieved. \n \nHow history can become a lie! Even today news in the media may \nwell be distorted. Hearing once one of the horrifying stories which \nare being told about William, Yogananda exclaimed: “How they \ndistort history! That’s not at all what happened!”  \n \n"}

He was moderate in drinking, for he deplored drunkenness \nin all men. In speech he was fluent and persuasive, being skilled at \nall times in making clear his will. He followed the Christian \ndiscipline in which he had been brought up from childhood, and \nwhenever his health permitted he regularly attended Christian \nworship each morning and at the celebration of mass.” If we were \nable to look into William's soul, we would see nothing but the \nshining light of God. \n \nWilliam the Conqueror was a man of generous character, was \nhighly self-disciplined, forgiving, protected his people, and \ndemanded virtue from his soldiers. In an unchaste age, he was \ncompletely faithful to his wife Matilda. This self-control certainly \nspeaks for itself, and was not often found often amongst kings – \nmistresses were common in those days. Orderic Vitalis speaks with \nreverence of those “wise and eloquent men who for many years \nlived at King William’s court.” \n \nWilliam and Matilda were known to be deeply devoted to each \nother, leading a happy marriage. (that too sings a song about \nWilliam's nature). Their harmony was not because she was a meek \nlittle sheep before him (though her body was very small). She, the \nQueen of England, was quite strong-willed, and is known to have \nopposed William at least once. She was the mediator between \nWilliam and his son Robert, when the two clashed. William and \nMatilda’s love and devotion to each other is testified in their letters \nto each other, which still exist. William bestowed power on \nMatilda, as it was unheard of in his days, when women could never \nbe rulers. Matilda ruled Normandy whenever William was in \nEngland. William the Conqueror was more than modern for his \ntimes. \n \n"}

It doesn’t. \nWilliam had a deeply loving side, he cared for people; and had an \nextremely devotional heart. How could it be otherwise if later he \nbecame Yogananda? Similarly: just describing Yogananda as \nbeing only sweet doesn’t present the whole picture. Yogananda \nhad also the other side of the coin: incredible power. \n \nWhen Matilda died, the distraught William built a marvelous \nbejeweled memorial over her tomb in Caen.  \n \nWilliam and Matilda are generally said to have had 10 children, 4 \nsons and 6 daughters; no illegitimate children are known. (By the \nway: all daughters and most sons were very religious children.) \nThey were: \n \n• Robert Curthose, 1052/4–1134: Duke of Normandy after \nWilliam; he was the most troublesome of the children, who even \nbetrayed him, and fought against him. \n• Richard: born 1054; he was killed in a hunting accident in 1075? \n• Adelaide (or Adeliza, or Alice), c. 1055–?; died a virgin \n• Cecilia (or Cecily), c. 1056–1126, abbess of Holy Trinity, Caen \n• William “Rufus,”1056–1100, King of England after William’s \ndeath \n• Matilda \n• Adela, c.1062–1138 \n• Agatha, c.1064–c.1080 \n• Constance, c.1066–1090 \n• Henry “Beauclerk,” 1068–1135, William’s youngest son, who \nlater became King Henry I, the king of England and Duke of \nNormandy . \n \nOne possible reason why Yogananda came as William might be \nthe training of his disciples, who had lessons to learn in the \nrounding out of their characters for their spiritual development. In \nfact, many of his disciples were with him in that lifetime as \nWilliam, as Yogananda said. \n"}

But Agatha is \nreported to have died a virgin- the marriage not being \nconsummated. She must have been only about 16 years old, if \nrecorded history can be trusted. She was buried in the Bayeaux \nCathedral, Bayeaux, Normandy, France. Interestingly, Yogananda \ntold Daya Mata that she had been Agatha, and that he had indeed \nsent her to become the Queen of Spain. But Agatha was intensely \nmonastic by nature, and desperately desired to “marry God alone.” \n(Story told by Daya herself). She arrived on ship in the Port of \nSpain, and they discovered her dead in her cabin: she had died \npraying on her knees, for her release from that ordeal. Her knees \nmust have suffered extremely. So much so, as Daya relates, that \nthe influence carried over into this life, in which she suffers from \nknee problems. Again Yogananda placed that inward soul into a \nposition of great outer responsibility. This time, however, Daya \nshouldered her enormous task, though she has often called it, \nunderstandably, “a burden.” \n \nHer former lifetime lingered with her, of course. Daya had \ndefinitively a regal quality about her. Fittingly (karmically \nspeaking), for her 50 year anniversary of service she was even \ngiven a crown by the SRF monks and nuns,. Also outwardly, to the \nconsternation of some, she is known to travel in a queenly car and \nlive in quite a queenly house. Her older sister, Ananda Mata, is \nsaid to have had that noble quality around her as well. Was Ananda \nMata, then, maybe a daughter of William too? Was she maybe \nDaya’s older daughter, Cecilia, who, as it is written, was the \nabbess of “Holy Trinity,” in Caen? \n \nAbout Henry  \nAt William’s deathbed, his youngest son Henry, who was to inherit \nonly money, asked him: “But how shall I use this inherited money, \n"}

William had \nobviously deeper than usual vision. \n \nSwami Kriyananda writes about his inner perception to have been \nKing Henry. Kriyananda too emanates a regal aura. He and Daya \nboth said they felt like brother and sister. “I feel you have been \nclose to Master in other lives,” Daya told him, too. \n \nOnce these two noble children were quite close: side by side at \nYogananda’s feet; then working together as the SRF president and \nvice-president; traveling for months through India together; and \nlater fighting a lot, as brothers and sisters often do. \n \nHenry, as William had prophesized, had a great role to play for his \nfather (and is of course not treated much better than William by \nmany \nhistorians). \nSimilarly, \nYogananda \ntold \nKriyananda \nrepeatedly, “You have a great work to do.”  \n \nAbout Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy after William \nDhirananda was, as Yogananda stated, William’s oldest son, \nRobert Curthose. William was deeply upset and saddened by his \nbeloved son’s betrayal, who had left him and united with the \nenemy. Robert himself wanted to be the Duke of Normandy, but \nWilliam refused him. They eventually fought, and William actually \nwas wounded by Robert in battle. Later William and Robert \nreconciled, and William left Normandy in Robert’s care, after his \ndeath. But Robert ruled quite badly- even his father’s work was at \nstake. Orderic Vitalis wrote: “Wishing to please everybody, \n[Robert] was too ready to accede light-heartedly to any request.” \nNobody judged him a good ruler. Once Henry became King of \nEngland, Robert never accepted him as such (since he was \nWilliam’s firstborn son), and fought Henry, but lost.

However, he treated Robert \n“generously, and with honor.” His brother lived, as historians now \nwrite, “in considerable luxury.”  \nDhirananda in this life again betrayed Yogananda, left him, fought \nagainst him in the courts. Karma repeats itself, until we stop it. \n \nAbout William “Rufus,” King of England after William \nHe is said to have been a somewhat rough man, but ever loyal to \nhis father. He too suffered much under the British historian’s pen, \nbut has recently been described in a better light. He died hunting, \nand historians of course have speculated that the accident was in \nreality Henry’s greedy plot to obtain the throne- a theory which by \nnow has been quite disproved. In Yogananda’s lifetime William \nRufus was a certain Mr. Vickerman, a businessman and devoted \nfollower of Yogananda, who lived in New York. He was a highly \nadvanced spiritual person, not part of SRF. Usually history \ndescribes Rufus as an anti-religious ruler. In fact, he was only \n\"anti-churchianity\". \n \nThe \"giant\" \nYogananda told his disciple Norman Paulson that he too was \npresent back then: “You were my giant.” Norman has a large body \nin this lifetime, too. Norman recounts: “In later years Yogananda \nrevealed to me why he called me his “giant returned.”  Norman \nrecounts: \"I experienced in a vision the Battle of Hastings as King \nWilliam conquered England. I was beside him in this battle, and \nwas of such stature I could look him straight in the eyes while \nstanding beside him as he sat astride his horse. I carried a gigantic \nbattle axe which in effect allowed no harm to come to his person \n(Paulsen, 1984).” \n \nAnother warrior \nTo Jerry Torgerson Yogananda said, “You were good: You used to \nfight for me.” \n \nThe linguist \n"}

What was the divine plan behind it? \nIsn’t it absolutely puzzling? \n \nThe answer is simply, God alone knows: “My thoughts are not \nyour thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For \nas the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher \nthan your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.” (Bible) \n \nBut the human mind longs to understand, and tries to come up with \na sensible answer. A possible answer, therefore, could be: William \nunited England, a country that had never known unity before, and \ncreated in it a power and a union which were never again \ndestroyed. Eventually, England helped to unite the world: it \ncolonized America in the West, and colonized India in the East. \n"}

This religious reformation and revival \nwas enormous, that's for sure. (If it was positive or not is still \ndebated amongst some scholars.) Christianity flourished (see \nDouglas). Was William's life maybe indeed \"one of the crucial \nsteps in the building of Christendom\", as author Hilaire Belloc \nexplains in his book William the Conqueror? Yogananda, as we \nshall see later, also saved Christianity in Spain from the Moors.

He \nhad a mission to fulfill, ordained by God. William's acts were the \ntough price he had to pay for accepting this mission. His human \nheart might indeed have cried and repented, even though he knew \nthat he had done the will of God.  \n \nThird: Yes, maybe at his death-bed his human side lamented, just \nas Christ, in his human side, was able to cry at the door of death: \n\"Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" Or Joan of Arc, the French \nsaint and heroine, said during her last confession that she had been \nselfish and cruel. Was she really? It looks as if the last moment is a \ndifficult one even for saints, because the human side surfaces. \nEven Sri Yukteswar, the lion of wisdom, was not free from it. \nWhen he faced his end, \"for a moment, Master trembled like a \nfrightened child\" (Autobiography of a Yogi).

William, incidentally, passed \non at the age of 59, just as Yogananda.  \n \nA group of the king’s closest friends gathered after his death to \nshare both their grief and their reverence, for the leader and the \nfriend they had lost. All spoke of his generosity, affability and \ngreatness of spirit (see Douglas). Many of these intimate associates \nof the Conqueror’s, not surprisingly, entered monasteries after his \ndeath, for the remainder of their lives. They were yogis, disciples, \naspiring saints, and companions of lifetimes. Others aided \nWilliam's sons in manifesting the vision he had for the Anglo-\nNorman kingdom. In this lifetime, again, Yogananda had disciples \nwho were mostly monastic, and others who put most of their \nenergies in his outer mission. \n \nOn the very day of William's death a surprising incident happened \nfar away: some Normans living in Rome and in Calabria affirmed \nto have mysteriously known about William’s passing. Did William \nappear to them, just as Yogananda appeared in flesh and blood to \nhis diciples?  \n \nWilliam's body was buried in Caen, in the Church of St. Stephan. \nWhat about the story of his body emanating a terrible stench, \nbecause it was injured when put forcibly into the stone coffin, so \nthat the service had to be finished hurriedly? The account is given \nexclusively by Orderic Vitalis, and seems an unlikely story, given \nthe account that now follows, concerning William's body.  \n \nThis is a fascinating fact which can’t be found in any British \nhistory book— again one has to go to French historians. One of the \nbest researched books is William the Conqueror, by Michel de \nBoüard, a highly respected professor, author, and historian of \nmedieval Europe. The following information is taken from his \nbook, and can be verified:  \n \nIn 1522, 435 years after William’s passing, the official \nhistoriographer of Caen, Charles de Bras, records the following \n"}

They were obviously coming with a special mission, \nthe nature of which is unknown. They were welcomed by the abbot \nPietro di Martigny, and asked him to open the coffin of William \nthe Conqueror: the body of William was found in a state of perfect \nincorruption, \n \nOne is wonderstruck. William, as Yogananda, left behind an \nincorrupt body. Both left the world this miraculous sign of their \nsaintly soul, like a \"heavenly signature.\" \n \nOf course materialistic minds try to explain such phenomena with \nspecial embalming methods. But William’s funeral was actually a \nhasty, somewhat chaotic affair, without extra-special treatments. \nAnd other Kings, treated doubtlessly with the best balms, weren’t \nkept incorrupt. William is a definitive exception. \n \nAs a sidelight: when William the Conqueror's body was found \nincorrupt, as Michel de Boüard writes, immediately an artist was \ncalled who made a spontaneous painting on wood of William’s \nlikeness. In the years afterwards many paintings of William were \nmade, probably all based on that artist’s sketch.  \n \nOver the ensuing centuries William's tomb was twice desecrated \nby French rebels – by Huguenots (1562) and Revolutionaries \n(1793), so today only a thighbone is left. In 1983 scientists \ndetermined by the thighbone that William was indeed a tall and \nsturdy man, especially for that age (people were much smaller \nback then.

William’s burial place today is \nmarked by a simple stone slab. \n \nBy the way: Edward of England, the King who had promised the \nEnglish throne to William, knew William well, and was actually \nhis half-uncle.

In 1102, 36 years after his death, his \ntomb was opened and it was found that his body too was incorrupt! \nMiracles happened there. King Edward was canonized in 1161 by \nPope Innocent II, and became England’s patron saint until he was \n“toppled” by St George.  \n \nWilliam the Conqueror and king Edward, then, were “twin \nincorrupts.” Playing the drama of kingly lives, they seemed to have \nhelped each other. One wonders if they had come down on earth \ntogether, as old friends.  \n \nKing Edward, interestingly, began a divine tradition, generally \nknown but little understood. He, with his kingly touch, was able to \nheal people from scrofula. William the Conqueror received that \nhealing power, which was then handed down through many \ngenerations of kings and queens. God probably smiles at the \n\"expert\" historians, who scratch their heads with these unscientific \n(but recorded) occurrences, as they are able to see only the surface, \nbut not His secret divine workings. \n \nA contemporary of Shakespeare, called John Hayward, a well-\nknown historian, wrote in 1613 about William: \"Verily, he was a \nvery great prince: full of hope to undertake great enterprises, full of \ncourage to achieve them: in most of his actions commendable, and \nexcusable in all. And this was not the least piece of his Honor, that \nthe kings of England which succeeded, did accompt their order \nonly from him: not in regard of his victory in England, but \ngenerally in respect of his virtue and valour.\"  \n \nBut even John Hayward, who called William the Conqueror \"a \ngreat prince\", did of course not understand the great God who was \nacting in and through William. That vision is difficult to achieve, \nespecially in the case of William the Conqueror. \n"}

Thus, \nEleanor was William the Conqueror’s great great granddaughter. \nAlfonso VIII’s daughter Berenguela was the mother of Ferdinand \nIII. In short: Ferdinand III was a direct descendant of William the \nConqueror! \n \nWhen Berenguela's brother Henry died in 1217, she renounced her \nrights to the throne, in favor of her son Ferdinand III. Ferdinand III \nthus basically succeeded his grandfather Alphonso VIII, and \nvictoriously continued his battle against the Moors. \n \nKing Ferdinand III (1198–1252) was a saint indeed.

This could be seen as a slight hint that others might have \nbeen around at that time: Dr. Lewis, and therefore maybe \nYogananda. \n \nHowever, we are taking a different route here (it’s all just for fun \nanyway, and quite un-provable!): Following the suspicion that \nYogananda left as his personal “heavenly signature” his incorrupt \nbodies, we are lead to the famous mystical poet, St. John of the \nCross (1542–1591), whose body is still incorrupt. St. John is, of \ncourse, one of the greatest figures in mystical Christianity and was \nincidentally a contemporary of Shakespeare. \n \nWhen St John of the Cross (Juan de Ypres y Alvarez) died, he was \nburied in a vault beneath the floor of a church. When the tomb was \nopened, nine months later, the body was fresh and intact; and when \na finger was amputated to be used as a relic, the body bled as a \nliving person would have done.

St. \nTeresa’s incorrupt heart and arm are enshrined and displayed at the \nCarmelite convent in the town of Alba de Tormes. \n \nYogananda said about Teresa: “After 25 years of suffering, the \nangels thrust a breath of fire in her heart and St. Teresa said, ‘It \nseemed I couldn't endure it and then suddenly I saw Him.’ That is \nthe eternal romance. That is the wave becoming the ocean. The \nbody of Christ became the ocean of Oneness which Teresa felt.” \nGyanamata, as Yogananda said, had attained Nirbikalpa samadhi \nin her previous lifetime. Was that the moment? \n \nSt. John was much younger than Teresa (by 27 years), just as \nYogananda was much younger than Gyananmata (by 24 years). St. \nJohn’s ministry included guiding Teresa herself. He became her \ndirector and confessor.

Yogananda explained: “It should, for it is almost the exact \nreplica of the hermitage in India where you were with me, that I \nwas telling you about.” He also explained to her that she was “a \ndancing girl in a temple.” Durga adds: “When I first came to Mt. \nWashington, he used to give me an apple or a banana to eat. I \nnever knew why for many years. Later he told me the reason. It \nwas because he liked to see me hold those articles with only my \nfirst three fingers, and the other two fingers would stick way out. \nThis brought back memories to his mind of my temple duties when \nI was in an Indian temple, offering incense and flowers on the \naltar.”  \n \nYogananda told Kamala that she lived in Brindaban in a recent \nincarnation.

As we have seen, Yogananda was a king \nonce or twice in Europe. Wouldn’t he have been a great king in \nIndia too? \n \nIf so, would he have left behind signs about such a life? \n \nMaybe!

Alexander was spiritually inclined, and \nYogananda wanted to reawaken that interest in Hitler.) \n  \nKing Chandragupta (king from 321–297 BC), after Alexander’s \ndeath, drove the Greeks from India in 305 BC, destroying the \nMacedonian garrisons left in India.

I knew it was to \nthis book. \n \nI replied, “But it says important things, things that need to be \nbrought out.” \n \nHe replied, “All right, I agree. But now, drop it. Your job is not to \njudge anyone, but to see God everywhere, and in everyone. Let this \nbook be a one-time-only statement. You be a child of God. \nJudgement is of the ego; divine acceptance is of the soul. So forget \nthe book now, and think only of Him.” \n \nHe was severe, but also very sweet. I was deeply grateful to him. \nAnd I agree with him completely. My feeling from this dream was \none of deep bliss. From now on I drop the subject altogether. It is \nno longer something about which I care to initiate any further \ndiscussion. \n \nWhen I first had this dream, I thought the saint had approved of my \ngetting out one edition of the second, improved version. But a \nnagging thought wouldn’t leave me: “Why even publish this \nedition? I’ve already presented my key thoughts. Whatever good \nthey might do has been done. Enough said.” Finally I decided it \nwas my conscience talking to me! So I wrote our publishing house \nand asked them to stop the print run. It has meant some loss of \nmoney, but better that than an offense to my conscience. \nSwami Kriyananda \n \n \nIt certainly shows Kriyananda's greatness to change his direction in \na second, once he sees it needs correction.
