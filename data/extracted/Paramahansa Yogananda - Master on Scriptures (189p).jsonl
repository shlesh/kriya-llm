In other words, the Scriptures deal with \nthe three factors of human beings, namely, the material, the mental and the spiritual. \nHence, all true Scriptures have been so written that they serve to be beneficial to the \nbody, mind, and soul of man. True Scriptures are like the wells of Divine waters, \nwhich can quench the three-fold material, mental, and spiritual thirsts of man. In \naddition, the Scriptures, in order to be worth while, should really help the business \nman, the mental man, and the spiritual man. Although both the material and the \npsychological interpretations of the Scriptures are necessary, it should be remembered \nthat the scriptural authors undertook with great pains to point out to man that the \nspiritual interpretations are of supreme importance to him.  \nA materially or intellectually successful man may not be the truly, scientifically \nsuccessful man who makes a perfect success of life; whereas, a spiritual man is the \nhappy \"all-round\" man, who is healthy, intellectual, contented, and truly prosperous, \nwith all-satisfying wisdom. Since by intuition the spiritual authors first sought to \nmake man primarily spiritual, I give the spiritual interpretation with the psychological \nand material interpretations interwoven. These interpretations will help alike the \nspiritual aspirant, the intellectual man, and the business man. \nSpiritual Interpretation of Bhagavad Gita \nThe Bhagavad Gita says, \"Fight the battle of life, or you will acquire sin.\" Chapter \n2:33. \nThe psychological interpretation of the above passage is that man should struggle hard \nand honestly until victory is won. No competition or reverses should discourage him. \nHe should keep on fighting in spite of failure because to give in means death, but to \ndie still battling for success gives him satisfaction even in death. If we do not die \nstruggling before we reach the end of the trail, we are bound to meet with success, but \nif we do not struggle, we have failed to use our God-given powers, and we are bound \nto acquire sin or sorrow. We are sinful also because we failed to demonstrate that we \nare made in the image of God, and because we did not exercise all our Divine \nheritage, our powerful will, to succeed. \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 2, "text": "The psychological interpretation of the above passage is that the mental powers of \nman become stronger when they successively and continuously battle with trials, with \ntemptations to make money by dishonest methods and with sense temptations, which \nbeset all life. The law of life offers man the power of resistance so that he may show \nhis sonship of God by bringing out his hidden immortal powers. Therefore, \npsychologically, it is a sin against the laws of soul-progress to acknowledge defeat by \nnot struggling strongly against all kinds of trials. To give up the continual struggle \nagainst sense appetites is to become a slave to them, and to become the victim of \nsuffering, for only he who is a master of the senses can be truly happy, whereas a man \nwho is ruled by his senses is very unhappy. \nThe spiritual interpretation of the above passage is that, unless the soul battles \ncontinuously to overcome the consciousness of the flesh by experiencing soul-\nconsciousness in meditation, that soul acquires sin. If the Son of God, or the image of \nGod dwelling in flesh, does not fight against the limitations of the flesh, but identifies \nhimself with it, then he invites sorrow. To be in soul-consciousness is to remember the \nSpirit, but to be in flesh-consciousness is to forget the power of the soul to feel \nOmnipresence. The soul that is identified with body experiences and the limitations of \nthe consciousness within the boundaries of the physical body, is cognizant of solidity, \nthe fragility of bones, the fear of accidents, the fear of life and death, a dependence \nupon experiences for increase in knowledge, and the fears of sickness, poverty, and \nignorance. Every soul has to battle continuously with limitations of body-\nconsciousness such as these. \nThrough meditation, the soul remembers its home in Omnipresent, Absolute, Blissful \nSpirit, but after a short meditation the soul goes back again to the remembrance of the \ntroublesome limitations of the body. Therefore, the soul, through the liquid fire of \nmeditation repeatedly has to battle with ignorance and body-consciousness in order to \nwipe out the intoxicating influence of cosmic delusion and sin. \nThis sinful cosmic delusion, which produces the body-consciousness, is the root-cause \nunderlying the three-fold physical, mental, and spiritual sorrows of man. \nLike the above, the Christian Bible has three interpretations of which the spiritual \ninterpretation of the words of Jesus Christ is given in the following article. \n   \n"}

D. \nTo His parents: (St. Luke, Chapter 2.) \n\"How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father s business?\" \nThe above depicts the proper Divine Attitude of Jesus to His parents. In the above \nstatement, the perfect life of Jesus brings forth a perfect utterance as to how a Divine \nchild, consecrated to serve humanity, should behave. Jesus hints that it is the highest \nduty of parents not to worry about a Divine child like Jesus, who was protected by the \nKing of Kings. He implies also that the highest duty of the son was to look after the \ncelestial business of spreading the Kingdom of the Heavenly Father. He implied that \nduty to our Heavenly Father comes first and foremost, and that duty to parents, \nalthough important, is secondary. \nJesus knew that parental love and affection, being blind, might demand from Him \ngreater attention to His earthly father s business than to His Heavenly Father s \nbusiness, for which He came on earth. He also here signifies to His parents that they \nshould know, and at the same time wish for Him to be busy with His Heavenly \nFather s business. Since parental and filial relationships are brought about by God, \nparents should first teach their children that it is good to be proficient in God s \nbusiness. \nThe above saying was the first hint by Jesus to His parents as to what they would have \nto expect, and about what His life was going to be. As all noble parents are lovers of \nGod and of His business, so they should wish the first interest of their children to be in \nGod s business. All parents should start their children on the right road in life by \nmaking them first proficient in contacting God, and in doing all things with God \nConsciousness. A life guided by God s inner, intuitive direction can be successful, \nhealthy, and complete only when activity is balanced with wisdom and happiness. \nThe ordinary man thinks that this world, his family, and his work are his business, but \nthe spiritual man knows that parents, children, family ties, the business world, and all \n"}

Hence, all business \nshould be spiritualized; that is, everything should be done with the consciousness of \nGod within, and man should try to please God by harmonizing all things with His \nideals. \nThe Hindu scriptures say that when one duty conflicts with another, then it is not duty, \nbut something to be avoided. Religious duties should not conflict with the duties of \nbusiness; neither should duty to business conflict with spiritual duties. When such \nconflict occurs, the spiritual duty is incomplete and should be modified. Business \nduties also should be revised when they militate against spiritual duties. Spiritual and \nmaterial duties should work together like two stallions, pulling the car of life \nharmoniously and uniformly to one happy goal. \nA successful life, therefore, must be begun with spiritual culture first, for all material \nand moral actions are governed by spiritual laws. All business must first conform with \nGod s business of Divine laws in order to be of lasting benefit to mankind. Any \nmoney-making business which caters only to human luxury, and false or evil \npropensities, is bound to be destroyed by the workings of the divine law of the \nsurvival of the worthiest. The business which does harm to the real spiritual comfort \nof people is not doing real service, and is bound to meet with destruction because of \nthe very nature of its activities. \nUniversal Christ-Consciousness appeared in the vehicle of Jesus, and now through \nYogoda Self-Realization, and these intuitionally received interpretations of the \nScriptures, the Christ-Consciousness is coming a second time to manifest through the \nconsciousness of every true Yogodan. \"All those who received Him, to them gave He \nthe power to become the Sons of God.\" \nAs a small cup cannot hold an ocean within, no matter how willing it may be to do so, \nlikewise the cup of material human consciousness cannot grasp the universal Christ-\nConsciousness, no matter how desirous it is, but when the student, by the Yogoda \nmethod of Meditation and Concentration, enlarges the caliber of his consciousness to \nOmniscience, he can hold the universal consciousness in all atoms (Christ-\nConsciousness) within his own. This is what is meant by \"Received Him.\" Thus, \naccording to Jesus, all souls who can actually find their souls one with Christ-\nConsciousness, by intuitive Self-Realization, can be called the \"Sons of God.\"   \n"}

Baptism means \nimmersion in water in order to cleanse or purify. Purification of the body should \nprecede the purification of the mind. Hence, all souls who desired to begin living the \nspiritual life had to purify their bodies. \"Cleanliness is next to Godliness,\" but baptism \nof the body, unless followed by baptism of the mind, becomes practically \nmeaningless. If we bathe and thus purify our bodies, we will find that our mind will \ntemporarily become purified, but unless we change our souls wickedness by \ncalmness, and meditation, and constant spiritual vigilance, we will remain the same \nold devils with bad habits in spite of the temporary purifying effect of the water on \nour bodies. To illustrate this metaphorically, a Hindu saint said to his would-be \ndisciple: \"Son, it is necessary to bathe in the Ganges to purify the mind from sin. The \nsins will leave you temporarily while you bathe in the holy waters; but they will wait \nfor you in the trees skirting the Ganges, and as soon as you come out of the sacred \ninfluence of the holy water, they will again jump on you.\" \nIt must be remembered, however, that bodily baptism by water has its good points. \nThe custom in India is to take spiritual lessons from a holy man only immediately \nafter bathing. To take spiritual lessons with a sweaty, unclean body is not effective. \nThe Baptists do well to immerse their initiates in water, but the ceremony of \nimmersion without following it up with continued spiritual lessons in meditation and \nGod-contact is of little value. \nSprinkling of Water on Head \nThe aristocratic, modern way of baptism consists in sprinkling water on the head. This \nis all that is left of the original custom of purifying the body by water. Baptism by the \nsprinkling of water may be all right for most civilized people, for they usually bathe \nthemselves daily. Then, too, immersion of initiates in water may be unnecessary if \nthey are mentally evolved, but sprinkling of water on the head of evolved people is \n"}

Thus it \nis all right for spiritually-minded people to bathe before being baptized, but it is also \ntrue that in modern america many aristocratic people would refuse to be baptized if \nthey had the prospect of a second bath in the church. They would rather forego \nentering Heaven than be publicly immersed in water. For such people, spiritual \ninstruction, without this second bath, is all right. \nAnother important matter in connection with the baptism of Jesus Christ is that He \ninsisted on being baptized by John, who in self-realization was far inferior to Him. \nJohn said he was not worthy to unloose the lachet of the shoes of Jesus, and that he \nbaptized only with water, while Jesus baptized with Spirit. Alas, modern baptism has \nbecome baptism by water only. Yogoda methods are showing the real way of \nbaptizing self with Spirit and ultimate wisdom. Feeling his spiritual inferiority, John \nwondered why Jesus wanted to be baptized with water. This action of Jesus distinctly \ndemonstrated the ancient pre-Christian, Hindu custom and the real spiritual way, \nwhich every God-aspirant should follow. \nThe method of finding God is different from the methods demanded by most colleges \nfor any kind of specific training. Even in medical training, the student never learns if \nhe roams from college to college, joining different medical institutions, and listening \nto a few lectures, but without going through intensive training in materia medica, \nphysiology, dissection, and other studies in one college. Also, it is true that a student \ncannot join all the universities at the same time. \nA student should follow one course in one college until he receives a certificate that \nhe has completed certain studies, but alas, in spiritual denominations even the loyalty \nthe usual intellectual college expects is not given to the denomination by the aspirant, \nnor is the time necessary for Self-Realization given to the practice of the spiritual \nlessons, by thousands of students in the Western world. Such people continue taking \nlessons from any new, good, bad, or indifferent teachers, who happen to come to town \nand advertize. I say that people should discriminate between the so-called teacher, \nwho uses religion only to make money or just a living, and the real teacher who may \nuse business methods in his religion in order to serve his brethren with real \nspirituality. \n"}

That is why \nin India, in the beginning we seek many until we find the right path, and the right \nmaster, and then remain loyal to him through death and eternity, until final \nemancipation. \nGuru and Teacher \nWe can have many teachers first, but only one GURU, and no more teachers \nafterwards. Teachers call those who come to learn from them students, but a GURU \ncalls the spiritual aspirant who comes to him, a disciple. Jesus himself said: \"None \ncometh unto the Father but by me.\" This signifies that human souls are mostly truant \nchildren of God roaming away from Him in the wilderness of suffering. Such souls \nare impelled by the scourge of sorrow to have faint glimpses of their lost home of \nspiritual blessedness. They begin to long for God, and inwardly pray for a way out of \nthe conundrum of life, then when the prayers of such errant children become deep and \nstrong enough, God is touched and sends help. It is then that the One Father of All \nsends a superman on earth to give help to the lost seeking souls. Such a man, ordained \nby God, to help the individual in response to deep prayer, is not an ordinary teacher, \nbut a GURU or a vehicle, whose body, speech, mind, and spirituality, God Himself \nuses to bring the lost souls back to the Home of Immortality. \nIn the Hindu scriptures and \"Whispers From Eternity\" it is written: \"As a naughty \nbaby, I cried for my Mother Divine, and she came to me as my GURU. My Guru, I \nfound Thee in response to my soul-cries. If all the gods are displeased and yet, Oh, \nGuru, if Thou art pleased, I am safe in the fortress of Thy pleasure, but if all the gods \nprotect me by the parapets of their blessings, and yet I receive not Thy benedictions, I \nam an orphan, left to pine spiritually in the ruins of Thy displeasure. Together, Guru \nand Disciple, we will fly to His Shores, and then we will smash our planes of finitude \nforever and vanish in our Infinite Life.\" \nThe above conception of Guru and Disciple depicts the only real way to retrace the \ntruant soul s footsteps back to God. This Guru and Disciple relationship is not the \nenslaving relationship between the blind church or temple members and an ignorant \nso-called priest of a temple or church, elected, not by God, but by the temple or \nchurch organization, or by a higher church dignitary, honored by orthodox followers, \nbut unknown to God.  \n"}

Formerly, my will was \nguided by habits, but when I tuned it in with the God-guided and Wisdom-guided will \nof my Guru, I found freedom.\" \nTo tune in with a soul whose will is guided by wisdom is to find freedom of will. \nMost teachers who slavishly control their students after the pattern of dogmatic \nteachings, destroy the power of free will in them, but obedience to a Guru does not \nproduce spiritual blindness in the disciple. On the contrary, it develops his third eye of \nwisdom and intuition. Most teachers want their students to see through the teacher s \neyes, but a Guru disciplines the disciple only until he can guide himself through \nwisdom. A Guru, (a Preceptor), is sent by God. \nIf a disciple, after following a Guru for a long time, should spurn him, then he actually \nspurns the help sent by God. A Guru is not a help for this life only. He also makes a \nspiritual soul-contact with the disciple, and says: \"Let our friendship be eternal, and \nlet us help each other through incarnations until we are both completely emancipated \nin spirit.

Many people acclaim that the spiritual \ninterpretation of the Bhagavad Gita and the Christian Bible is what is predicted as the \n\"Second Coming of Christ\", because in such interpretation there is revealed and \nliberated the truth hidden in the dark caves of theoretical and theological studies. \nJesus Christ was crucified once, but His Christian teaching has been, and is now being \ncrucified by ignorant people. The Yogoda movement is attempting to show how the \nChrist-Consciousness of Jesus, free from theological crucifixion, can be brought back \na second time into the souls of men. \nThese spiritual interpretations are born of intuition, and will be found to be universally \ntrue if they are meditated upon with intuitive perception.

The discussion took place on the fields of Kurukshetra in India on the eve of \na battle there. This Holy Testament of the Hindus, (this Bhagavad Gita), is composed \nof seven hundred verses, and in included in the Sixth Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata \nepic, from the 25th to the 42nd verses. The Bhagavad Gita is one of the greatest \npsycho-spiritual treatises of the world. \nThe greatest Hindu scriptures are the four Vedas. One hundred and eight Upanishads \nwere written, containing the essence of the four Vedas. Six systems of Hindu \nphilosophy, Sankya, Yoga, Vedanta, Nimansa, etc., contain the essence of the Vedas \nand Upanishads, and the Bahgavad Gita is the essence of the six philosophies, 108 \nUpanishads, and 4 Vedas. By intuitive study of the Vedas, Upanishads, and six \nsystems of Hindu philosophy, or else by contacting the cosmic consciousness, one can \nexplain the Bhagavad Gita. The interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita as received from \nwithin, is now being given here, for the first time. The Bhagavad Gita was very \ncleverly written by Sage Byasa in that he interwove historical and psychological \ntruths. Thus, the gita is true historically, but it is at the same time a psychological \nword-painting of the tumultuous inner life of man. The principle purpose in thus \ninterweaving history and psychological truths on the part of the sage, Byasa, was to \nhide the deep spiritual truths in a hard shell of historical facts, so that only the truly \nwise would break through the shell and find the spiritual meat within. This shell of \nhistorical facts served also as a protection for the inner meanings, (the deep, inner, \nspiritual truths), from the gaze of ignorant eyes. Byasa s purpose is clearly seen in that \nhe mentions the actual battle on the field of Kurukhestra only a little here and there in \nthe first and second chapters, but then launches deeper into spiritual discussions.  \nHistorical Truth in The Bhagavad Gita \nIn the west of India there ruled over Guzerat a divine warrior, King Krishna. This is \ntold in the Mahabharata, which was compiled during the epic age, (1400-100 B.C.) \n"}

His life demonstrates that the \nrenunciation of action is a conflicting doctrine: what is really necessary is the \nrenunciation of the fruits of action. God has sent man into this life so circumstanced \nwith hunger and desires that he needs must work. Without work human civilization \nwould be a jungle of disease, famine, and confusion. If all the people in the world \nshould leave their material civilizations and live in the forests, then the forests would \nhave to be transformed into cities, or else all would die because of lack of sanitation. \nThen again, material civilization is full of imperfections and misery. What possible \nremedy can be advocated? Krishna s life demonstrates that, according to his \nphilosophy, it is not necessary to flee the jungle of material life. The problem can be \nsolved by bringing God here where He has placed us; and Heaven necessarily then \nmust come, in the mind, where God s contact reigns, no matter what the environment \nmay be. \"A Heaven without Thee, Oh God, I want not! I love to work in the factory if \nI can but hear Thy voice in the noisy wheels of the machinery. A material life without \nThee, Oh God, is a source of physical misery, disease, crime, ignorance, and \nunhappiness.\" \nComplete Renunciation \nComplete renunciation has been the theme of many, even of the oriental Christian \nBible,\n\"Take no heed for the body, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall wear.\" Swami \nShankara, the founder of the Swami order, advocated complete renunciation. Other \ngreat prophets also have done so, with the theory that material desires might be a \ncause of hindrance in the path of self-realization. On the other hand, those who plunge \ndeeply into material life grow away from God. They wallow so deeply in the mud of \nmundane worries that they cannot extricate themselves and thus walk freely along the \npath of self-realization. To avoid these two extremes of first, renunciation from the \nworld, and second, drowning in material life, man should so train his mind by \nconstant meditation that he can perform the necessary dutiful actions of his daily life \nwith the consciousness of God within. All businessmen and women should remember \nthat their worldly life can be freed from endless physical and mental ills, provided \nthey add daily deep meditation to their daily business in the office or to their family \ncontacts. \nThe doctrine of the Bhagavad Gita stands as the only doctrine suited to our modern \nbusy life of many worries. To work without the peace of God is Hades; and to work \nwith God s happiness ever bubbling in the soul is to carry a usable, portable Paradise \n"}

To be constantly worried in a large estate is to live in \nHades; to live in a rickety shack with that inner, boundless, soul-peace is real \nParadise. Whether in a palace or under a tree, we must carry this inner Paradise \nalways. Thus does the doctrine of Krishna strive to teach the modern businessman. A \ngrasping ever for more money, a plunging deeper into more prolonged work with \nattachment or blindness will produce misery. The outward renunciation of material \nthings with still an inner attachment to them, leads to hypocrisy and delusion. One \nmust be really convinced in his heart that God-happiness is preferable to sense \npleasures. \nModeration in Everything \nThe path advocated in the Bhagavad Gita is the moderate, medium, golden path both \nfor the busy businessman and for the highest spiritual aspirant. Most Christians follow \nneither the path of complete renunciation, as Jesus advised when He said, \"Sell all that \nye have and follow me\", nor do they know how to find God in their busy material life. \nFor such to follow the paths advocated by the Bhagavad Gita, would be their \nsalvation, for it is a book of universal self-realization; it embraces the underlying \nscientific truths of the oriental Christian Bible, and also of all other spiritual \nscriptures. \nIntellectual, Historical, and Spiritual Interpretation of  The Bhagavad Gita \nJust as twelve years of listening to lectures ABOUT oranges without ever TASTING \nthem would give no REAL knowledge of them, so a life-long theoretical study of the \nBhagavad Gita will produce very little intuitive spiritual knowledge. It was not \ncompiled for dry intellectualists to perform intellectual gymnastics with its sayings for \nthe entertainment of intellectual dogmatists, but rather its purpose was to show to a \nman living in the world how he could live a balanced life and at the same time \nactually contact God by following the step-by-step methods of self-realization. \nTherefore, I shall not dwell long on the history of the Bhagavad Gita, nor on the \nhistorical analyses of intellectualists, but shall dig into its heart with the pickaxe of \ndeep concentration, and bring forth its spiritual fountains which will quench the thirst \nof the deep spiritual seeker. The best way to judge the various interpretations of the \nBhagavad Gita is to ask youself how much lasting, spiritual benefit you derived from \nperusing them. \nHistory of the Kurus and Pandus \nLong ago Bichitrabirya was king of Hastinapura in India. Byasa married a relative of \nhis. Two sons, Dhritarashtra and Pandu, were born to Byasa. The elder, Dhritarashtra, \nhad one hundred sons, but Pandu, the younger, had five most pure warrior sons. \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 14, "text": "Dhritarashtra became king, but he was blind; so his son, Duryodhana, ruled in his \nstead. By a clever play of the dice, Duryodhana filched from the Pandus their \nkingdom, and sent them into the forest into exile for twelve years, after which he \npromised to allow them to try to regain their lost kingdom. At the allotted time, the \ngood Pandus returned and demanded their kingdom, but the Kurus refused to part with \nany piece of land, even as long and as broad as a needle. \nCause of the Battle at Kurukshetra \nTherefore, the five famous Pandu brothers sought the aid of the political prophet, \nKrishna, the then reigning King of Guzerat, who then offered to become the charioteer \nand chief counselor of war to Arjuna, one of the five warrior brothers. The crooked \nKurus, led by Duryodhana, and the pure Pandus, led by the five Pandu princes, \ngathered together on the holy field of Kurukshetra, (a modern small city in India.) \nKing Dhritarashtra, being blind, requested Byasa to tell him about the battle. Instead, \nSage Byasa gave him a man of impartial vision, Sanjaya, whom he then gifted with \nspiritual television. Thus he could see clairvoyantly from afar the forces of Kurus and \nPandus gathered on the field of battle. The Bhagavad Gita opens with the blind King \nDhritarashtra asking Sanjaya thus, \"Gathered together on the holy plain of \nKurukshetra, eager for battle my children, the Kurus and the Pandus, what have they \nbeen doing?\" Throughout the Bhagavad Gita the Sage Byasa took a real battle which \nactually once took place on the field of Kurukshetra, and the names of a few warriors; \nand he interwove with them psychological names and characters, and thus built out a \ndescription of a psychological war between man s crooked mental tendencies and \nphysical sense appetites, (the Kurus), and his good discriminative tendencies, (the \nPandus). When we take many of the Sanskrit names he used, and analyze the roots of \nthe words used as the titles of the warriors, we find a psychological tendency spoken \nof as a warrior; for instance, take Dhritarashtra, \n \nDhritam means held, \nRashtram \nmeans reins,\nand Jana, which means who holds the reins of the senses or the blind \nmind. This is spoken of the mind, which gives coordination to the senses as the reins \nkeep together the several horses of a chariot. The body is the chariot,\nthe owner of \nthe body, the soul, the charioteer is the Intelligence. The horses are the senses, and the \nmind is said to be blind because it cannot see without the help of the senses and the \nintelligence. \nMacrocosmic Interpretation \nByasa, representing allegorically God the Father, became immanent in the dual \npositive - negative Cosmic Vibration, which in turn gave birth to two sons,\nDhritarashtra, representative of matter,\nand Pandu, representative of intelligent Life \nwhich governs all matter, or as in the Christian Bible, God the Father,\nthe Son, \nChrist Intelligence, or Pandu,\nand Holy Ghost, (Holy Vibration). \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 15, "text": "Microcosmic Interpretation \nByasa, the soul, was the reflection of God the Father. A reflection of the sun can only \npartially (half) represent the real sun. Hence, Byasa was spoken of as the half-brother \nof Bichitrabirya, or God the Father. As the sun becomes a thousand suns when \nreflected in a thousand cups filled with water, so also God the Father, reflected in the \nbodies of many men, becomes many souls. Byasa represents the original passively-\nactive soul in man, which is responsible for creating the two children, the blind king, \nor Emperor Mind, (Dhritarashtra), and the pure King Discrimination (Pandu). \nPandu is derived from a word which means \"that which signifies intelligence\". The \nSenses and the blind king Mind, and the pure Discrimination, all reigned in the \nKingdom of the Body. The name of the field of battle stands for the body, thus: \nKurukshetra,\n(Kuru\naction; Kshetra\nfield), signifies the field of action. \nOriginally, in childhood, the kingdom of the body is reigned over principally by pure \ndiscrimination and calmness. The eldest of the five Pandu brothers was \nYudhisthira,\n(Yudhi Sthira Ja Sa,\nwho is calm in psychological battles)\ncalmness \nis thus the eldest offspring of discrimination. The other four brothers were Bhrima, \n(Power of Vitality), Arjuna, (Self-Control,\nhe who is non-attached), Nakula, (Power \nto Obey Good Rules), and Sahadeva (Power to Stay Away from Evil). But after \nchildhood, the Ego, the pseudo-soul, or the body-bound soul, (Duryodhana, the eldest \nchild of restless mind), and the hundred sense inclinations, all offsprings of restless \nmind, by a clever dice-play with sense lures and material desires, filched the bodily \nkingdom from pure discrimination and its kindred princely faculties, and sent them \ninto exile for twelve years. When bad sense habits are once well established in the \nbody, good habits and wisdom are usually banished for at least twelve years. \nComplete physiological and mental changes as well as the creation of new habits \noften are possible after twelve years. The story of the Bhagavad Gita allegorically tells \nhow after the bad habits had reigned for twelve years in the bodily kingdom, the good \nhabits, being now reawakened by discrimination, tried to return after their twelve \nyears of banishment with aid of Krishna or the Soul-force. In like manner, after the \ngrowing youth goes through evil experiences for twelve years, and takes many \"hard \nknocks\" under the sense regime of greed, anger, sex, jealousy, and egoism,\nthen \ndiscrimination and the warriors of calmness, vital force, and self-control try to return \nafter twelve years of banishment by the bad sense-habits and seek to regain their lost \nbodily kingdom. But the crooked Kurus, or mental tendencies, with their sense armies \nrefuse to give in or part with their kingdom of the body, which originally belonged to \nthe discriminative faculties. \nSo Krishna, the GURU, or the actively awakened Soul, or meditation\nborn Intuition, \ncomes to aid Self-Control, or Arjuna, and the other four discriminative tendencies of \ncalmness, Pranayama, (controlling the life-force in the nerve-telephones by switching \n"}

These sense Bolsheviks, \noccupying the kingdom of the body, have brought only sickness, mental worries, and \nthe pestilence of ignorance, and spiritual famine, due to the shortage of wisdom in the \nbodily kingdom.

There is a vast difference between the powerful sulphuric acid in a bottle \nand the mere statement of its formula as H2SO4. Neither the formula itself, nor the \ndescription of the power of sulphuric acid in a book can ever describe its burning, \nvital quality. Truths of self-realization are like little insignificant seeds, but their \npower and wisdom-yielding qualities are truly felt when they are seen to grow into \nhuge trees in the gardens of the self-realization of saints,\ntrees laden with the fruits \nof Divine Love. \nWhy a Guru Is Necessary \nWe meet little teachers in the beginning through our vague desires to know truth. But \nthe GURU (or Preceptor) is the living embodiment of scriptural truths and is the agent \nof salvation appointed by God in response to a devotee s demands for release from all \nthe bondage of matter. It is very difficult to choose the right path from the many \nreligious paths and varied religious opinions. Most people who wander from church to \nchurch seeking intellectual inspiration, never find God, for intellectual inspiration is \nnecessary only until one begins to \"drink\" God. Otherwise, intellectual inspiration, \n(when it forgets to taste God), is detrimental to self-realization. It is more easy to \nfollow a living, breathing, talking man (who lives truth) than a mute scripture. If a \nsaint has reached his goal, whether by the shorter Yoga route, or by the long-winded \nspiritual-prayer way, he experiences actual self-realization. Anyone following him \ncertainly would reach the goal by using either method. Unlike ordinary prayers, real \nprayers, which alone can bring conscious response from God, must be offered in \nmeditation, intensely and for many hours continuously until Divine response comes.  \nThe Signs of a Guru \nThe signs of a GURU are as follows: his eyes are still and unwinking whenever he \nwants them to be so; by the practice of Yoga his breath is quiet without his forcibly \nholding it in his lungs; his mind is calm without effort. If a man has eyelids that blink \ncontinually, and lungs acting like bellows all the time, and a mind always restless like \na butterfly, and he keeps on telling you he is in cosmic consciousness, laugh at him. \nJust as a man cannot pretend that he is sleeping while he continues to run, so one with \nrestless eyes, breath, and mind cannot convince you, who know better, that he is in \ncosmic consciousness. Just as sleep manifests in the body by certain physiological \nchanges, so the muscles, eyes, breath, all usually become still during cosmic \nconsciousness. No GURU can be developed alone by years of study in the intellectual \nfactory of a theological seminary, which deems it has attained its ends when it confers \nB.D. or D.D. degrees. Such titles can be won by men of good memory, but character, \n"}

The \ncomplete revival and restoration of Christian Churches can be effected only by \ndiscarding the oft-repeated theoretical sermons and too-frequently changing psycho-\nphysical ceremonies, and replacing them with added concentration during church \nservices on the part of the members;\nthey should concentrate more and more on \nperfect stillness in both the physical and mental realms. For stillness and peace are the \nreal temples wherein God must often visit His devotees. \nSecret of Religion \nThe secret of true religion lies in the cave of stillness, in the cave of wisdom, in the \ncave of the spiritual eye. By concentrating on the point between the eyebrows and \ndelving into the depths of quiet, one can find answers to all the religious queries of the \nheart. A disciple should tune in with the will of his GURU. Such tuning in of your \nhabit-led and whim-guided will with the wisdom-guided will of your GURU is far \ndifferent from mechanical obedience to an unspiritual guide, no matter whether he is \ntraditionally, religiously, or socially elected. To follow the blind unthinkingly is to fall \nwith them into the ditch of ignorance completely. To follow the awakened, if you are \nblind, is to reach the goal without danger. How can you take away the blot from your \nbrother s eyes if there is still a blot in your own? \nFreedom of Will \nVery few people truly know what freedom of will means. To be compelled to do \nthings by the dictates of your own instincts and habits is not freedom.

Having found him, follow him closely, obey him with intelligent devotion, \nand practise what he teaches you; thus ultimately you will attain your highest goal. \nThe Baptism of Jesus by Water and by the Holy Ghost \nThe gospel tells us that John the Baptist had said to the people, \"I indeed baptize you \nwith water unto repentance, but He that cometh after me is mightier than I whose \nshoes I am not worthy to bear. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with \nfire\". Jesus, being high in spiritual advancement, obeyed the law of temporary purity \nsignified by baptism by water. But immediately following His baptism by water, He \nwas also baptized by the Spirit. The real, advanced GURU asks his disciple first to \nbathe his body with water, and then after the body feels the influence of temporary \ncleanliness and purity, he baptizes him with Spirit. But sometimes it has happened \nthat when the disciple is further advanced, as Jesus was, and the GURU, like John the \nBaptist, not so far advanced, then the Spirit of God uses the Holy Ghost to baptize the \nadvanced disciple through the medium of the divine agent, the GURU, even though he \nis less advanced in spirituality than his disciple. The GURU must be wise, but \nsometimes a GURU of past incarnations is in this life less advanced in wisdom than \nthe disciple. Sometimes it is given him to redeem a disciple more spiritually advanced \nthan himself. A GURU, being the agent of salvation appointed by God, must take the \ndisciple through successive incarnations, if necessary, until complete salvation of the \ndisciple is reached. A great secret of understanding lies in the reason for the less \nadvanced GURU, John, initiating as his disciple the so greatly-advanced Savior of \nmankind,\nJesus. In his past incarnations John the Baptist had been appointed as the \ndivine agent to be the original GURU of Jesus. In the dim past, when John was first \nsent by God as the GURU of Jesus in response to His prayers, the GURU-\nconsciousness of John was more advanced than the disciple-consciousness of Jesus. \nAt that time the souls of John the Baptist and of Jesus were eternally bound together \nby the law of unconditional divine friendship, and both at this long-ago first meeting \nas GURU and disciple had made the resolution, \"We will be friends forever, striving \nfor one another s perfection until both of us redeem our omnipresence, now locked \nbehind the bars of flesh.\" So as time went on and many incarnations passed, by a \nsuperior effort, the soul of Jesus advanced further than did the soul of John.

The prophet \nElias, who was much more highly advanced than Jesus when He first became his \ndisciple, later on, through the irony of his own Karmic law (actions of past lives), had \nlessened in spirituality, and thus had the power to baptize with water only. By \nintuition John the Baptist knew of the coming of Jesus Christ, yet having less \nspirituality for a time he forgot he was once Elias. After the baptism of Jesus, John \nwas informed of this fact, \"For Elias is come already\". But John the Baptist knew that \nJesus, though now so far advanced as to become the Redeemer of the World, was his \ndisciple of former incarnations, and thus he predicted, \"I indeed baptize you with \nwater, but One mightier than I cometh, the latchet of Whose shoes I am not worthy to \nunloose. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\" Jesus was now more \nadvanced than John the Baptist, yet He accepted him as His GURU of former \nincarnations,\nthe agent first sent by God to enter with Him into this spiritual, divine \ncovenant and this divinely ordained friendship. \"We will be divine friends forever \nuntil out souls by mutual help and the lasting goodwill of many incarnations break the \nbubble-walls of caging desires and set free our imprisoned omnipresence to become \none with the sea of Infinitude\". This is why Jesus said, \"Suffer it to be so now, for \nthus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness\", and why He chose to be baptized by \nJohn with water according to the ancient custom. It is very interesting then to note \nhow the Spirit of God used the Holy Ghost for the spiritual baptism of Jesus.  \nTrue and False GURUS \nIn India real Gurus know not only how to baptize with water but also with Spirit, or \nthe Holy Ghost. But alas! Many Hindus in their temples, and many Christians in their \nchurches are baptized only with water, temporarily experiencing good physical \nbaptism, but knowing and perceiving nothing of those marvelous soul-renewing \nexperiences of spiritual baptism. Ministers in churches and priests in temples are \noftentimes chosen only by virtue of their intellectual study of the scriptures, and \nsacerdotal authority conferred on them by ceremonies, performed by formally higher \nspiritual authority. But real ministers and priests who are fit to be GURUS train first \ntheir inner selves in the theological school of intuition and meditation. They must \nspiritually baptize themselves first before they can aspire to baptize others at all. They \nteach their disciples not for mundane gains, but, being impelled by God, they baptize \nthem spiritually. It is admirable to lecture and teach good principles, but without \nbecoming a real GURU one cannot redeem souls, nor should he accept others as \ndisciples until he has progressed far himself. Once the true relationship of GURU and \ndisciple is established there will be no more blind spiritual gropings, roamings, or \npartings because of admonition on the part of the GURU, or for any other reason. \n"}

Surprised at not being profusely welcomed, he said, \"Don t you \nknow me, God?

Water \nopens the pores of the skin, letting out the disturbing body-poisons, calming and \nsoothing the circulatory system. \nBaptism by Water \nWater cools the nerve-endings and sends reports of cool sensations throughout the \nvital centers, balancing evenly all the vital energies. All life came primarily from \nenergy,\nthen from nebulae,\nthen from water. All seeds of life are irrevocably \nconnected with water. Physical life cannot exist without it. \nBaptism by Feeling \nIf you love poetry and are much in the company of a great poet, he will baptize you \nwith those clean, wholesome feelings and the appreciation of good in everything \nwhich are aroused always by good poesy.

The soul, a reflection of spirit, while \ndwelling within it, cannot remember its omnipresent state. But by meditation one can \nhear the vibration of the body by closing the ears,\nas taught in the Yogoda fifth \nlesson,\nand then tune it in with the cosmic mind which emanates from the vibration \nof all atoms and life force. The Christian Bible says, \"God is the Word.\"\n(Cosmic, \nintelligent, sounding vibration.) Sage Patanjali, greatest of Hindu Yogis, says, \"The \nSpirit, God the Father, or Iswara, manifests Himself as the cosmic vibration, or \nmatter.\" \"The Spirit was made flesh,\"\nfor the intelligent spirit materializes itself into \ngross flesh by changing its rate of vibration. Cosmic intelligence becomes cosmic \nintelligent motion, or vibration, which changes into cosmic energy. This intelligent \ncosmic energy changes into electrons and atoms. Electrons and atoms change into gas, \nsometimes known as cosmic nebulae. Cosmic nebulae, or masses of diffused gaseous \nmatter change into water. Water changes into solid matter. Man s body is a part of this \nvariously divided matter. In cosmic vibration all things are done; but when cosmic \nvibration becomes frozen into matter, then it becomes many. So man s body, being \nseparated from cosmic vibration, again must retrace the various states of higher \nvibrations in order to lift his consciousness from the vibrations of breath, heart, and \ncirculation to the vibrating sound emanating from cosmic life force and all atoms. \nWith closed eyes, one can feel his consciousness limited by feelings of the flesh and \nby the sounds of breath, heart, and circulation. But by deep meditation,\nas taught in \nthe Yogoda fifth lesson,\nthe Yogoda student can hear the voice of cosmic sound, \nemanating from all atoms and sparks of cosmic energy. By listening to this \nomnipresent sound the consciousness of the body-caged soul begins gradually to \nspread itself form the limitations of the body into omnipresence. One listening to this \ncosmic sound will find his consciousness spreading within to limitlessness. This \ncosmic sound, emanating from cosmic vibration, is called the \"Holy Ghost.\" Ghost \nsignifies an intelligent, invisible, conscious force, or intelligent cosmic vibration. It is \nholy because the eminent (outflowing) consciousness of God the Father, or Christ \nintelligence, guides it to create all finite matter. The ancients, not versed in the \n"}

The \nHindus speak of this \"Holy Ghost\" as the \"Aum\". \"A\" stands for \"Akar\" or creative \nvibration; \"U\" for \"Ukar\" or preservative vibration; and \"M\" for \"Makar\" or \ndestructive vibration. The storm-roar of the sea creates the waves,\npreserves them \nfor some time as larger or smaller waves,\nand then dissolves them. So the cosmic \nsound of Aum or Holy Ghost creates all things as Nebulae, preserves them in the \nforms of the present cosmos and worlds, and ultimately it will dissolve all things in \nthe bosom-sea of God. But this cosmic dissolution is sometimes only partial and \ntemporary, and again sometimes it is complete and for a long time. In the partial \ntemporary dissolution, portions only of matter and worlds are dissolved; but in \ncomplete dissolution the entire system of universes, all stars and planets, all things are \ndissolved. But the dissolving of all creation is impossible until all souls cease to desire \nanything at all and thus become fully emancipated in God. Unredeemed souls desire \nlife, and with it they desire the earth, the sky, and its starry beauties. So, in order to \nfulfill our desire for children, souls come on earth as fleshly human beings. Aum has \nto create the entire universe at the behest of God the Father. Because of the endless \nrise and dissolution of the desires of creatures, their universe is endlessly being \ndissolved and recreated again. \nHence, baptism by the Holy Ghost means first the dissolution of all wrong desires by \ngood desires, and then the conquering of all good desires by an only desire for the \nblessed contact of God. To know God is not the negation of all desires, but instead \ntheir complete fulfillment. Men of the world strive wrongly to fulfill desires by \nforgetting to distinguish between those of the world and those of the soul. Just as by \nfeeding somebody else your hunger cannot be satisfied, so by wrongly trying to \nsatisfy the senses your soul can never be happy. Senses crave indulgence, greed, and \ntemptations to excite and amuse them, whereas soul can be satisfied only by the \ncalmness, peace, and bliss, born of meditation and the moderate use of the sense \nservants. Ambition for good things, noble achievements, and spiritual organization \nwork, serving the many, must be instituted to displace desires for selfishness and \ngreed and for helping only one s own self or one s immediate family. Enjoy all good \nwork and achievements with God. By contacting god in the world and in meditation \nyou will find all your heart s desires fulfilled.

As he progresses \nfurther by deeper and longer meditation, he will find his consciousness vibrating \nsimultaneously in his body, in the earth, the planets, the universes, and in every \nparticle of matter. \nThe Aum Sound \nThe intelligent holy vibration, or the first manifestation of God the Father, therefore \nmanifests as the cosmic sound of Aum, or Amen, which can be heard in mediation. It \nalso manifests itself as cosmic energy in all matter. All earthly sounds and the sounds \nof the body,\nthe heart, lungs, etc.,\ncome from the cosmic sound of Aum. Aum \ncontains all the sounds of the nine octaves perceptible to the human ear, as well as all \ncosmic sounds, low or high, which can not be registered in the human ear. So also, all \nforms of earthly lights,\ncoal light, gas light, electric light, astral light,\ncome from \ncosmic energy. Cosmic sound manifests as cosmic energy and vice versa. This cosmic \nsound manifests as the astral sounds of harps, bells, etc., (microcosmic cosmic \nsounds) in the astral body of man. So also this cosmic energy exists as the reflected, \nluminous, or astral, body of man. Higher lessons of Yogoda teachings can teach one \nto hear and locate the astral sounds emanating from the spinal cord. The physical body \nis condensed cosmic energy. the astral body is also condensed cosmic energy. The \nphysical body has two eyes,\npositive and negative, due to the law of relativity. The \nastral body has only one eye, which is variously named,\nthe spiritual eye, the single \neye, (the Christian Bible), the third eye, (the Hindu Bible), the star of the east, the star \nof wisdom, the dove descending from Heaven, the inner eye, the intuitive eye, the \nShiva s eyes, the star through which the wise men saw, etc., etc. During the baptism \nby the Holy Ghost, as perceived by Jesus Christ, He perceived it as a cosmic sound or \nHeaven, and the spiritual eye as the dove. This spiritual eye is a spiritual telescope \nwith three rays as its lenses. The outer circle is golden. The inner lens of light is blue, \nand is studded with a five-pointed, silver star, (as the third ray). The microcosmic \ncosmic energy microcosmically manifests in the human body as the specific reflected \nlife energy or the astral body. The spiritual or astral eye is the eye of the astral body. \n"}

In meditation, \nfirst the life force must be withdrawn from the body, and must cross the portals of \ncosmic energy represented by the silver ring. Then it must plunge in the blue light \nrepresenting Christ consciousness. Then it must penetrate through the silver star \nrepresenting Spirit, in the region of the Infinite. These three,\ngolden, blue, and silver \nlight,\ncontain all walls of rays of ultra-violet, electronic, and atomic rays,\nrays of \ncosmic energy through which one has to penetrate before one can reach Heaven. The \ngolden halo and the blue central light are the two wings of the dove and the little \nwhite star represents the mouth of the dove. The outer golden light is the Holy Ghost \nor Cosmic Energy or Nature, the blue represents God the Son or Christ, and the silver \nstar represents God the Father. \nSo Jesus, during His baptism, saw the cosmic energy manifested in bodily shape, or \nmaterialized out of the ether, as the telescopic spiritual astral eye; and out of that \nspiritual eye representing the cosmic energy came a voice, or intelligent, all-creative, \ncosmic sound, saying, or vibrating, in intelligible voice, (for all language comes from \nthe Holy Ghost), \"Thou are my Son, (or my manifestation); I am glad thou hast risen, \n(lifted thy consciousness), from matter, and tuned in with my Omnipresence.\" \nAll material human beings are prodigal sons who have left the home of Omnipresent \nHoly Ghost and have identified themselves with the infinitely smaller territory of the \nhuman body. This Holy Ghost is the Great Comforter. Being guided by the universal, \nreflected, God-Consciousness, it contains the all-coveted bliss of God. One filled with \nthis Holy Ghost, or Holy Vibration, can talk with the diverse tongues of inspirations \nof men, animals, and atoms. Since all languages are productions of the Holy Ghost, \nwhen man can hear, touch, and spread in Aum, (or cosmic sound emanating from \nHoly Ghost), then he can understand or utter all languages, not only of men, but also \nof all animals and all atoms too. Holy Ghost, Aum of the Hindus, the Mohammedan \nAmin, the Christian Amen, Voice of Many Waters, Word are the same thing. Aum is \ncalled the word because the word signifies cosmic intelligent vibratory sound which is \nthe origin of all sounds and languages. This intelligent cosmic vibration or word is the \nfirst manifestation of God in creation. \nOn the day of Pentecost the disciples were filled with the new wine of joy coming \nfrom the touch of Aum, or the comforting Holy Vibration, and they could talk \"in \ndivers tongues.\" Such were some of the experiences of Jesus after His baptism by the \nHoly Ghost; and such can be the experiences of Yogoda students now if they study \nthe Yogoda lessons, and do not forget them, but continue to practice them constantly \nand continually in real life as the years roll by.

His life-force is a reflection of cosmic energy. His \nbody is condensed cosmic energy and life energy. Consciousness, life-force and the \nbody are the different rates of conscious, cosmic vibration. Life-force vibrating more \nfinely becomes cosmic consciousness and life-force when it vibrates grossly, changes \ninto electrons, atoms, molecules, and bodily flesh. After all, the human body, life-\nforce, and consciousness, being three different vibrations, are held together by the \nnucleus of ego and soul. Man is condensed miniature vibration. In order to free the \nsoul from the cage of the threefold vibrations of body, life-force, and consciousness, it \nhas to be baptized or united with the original cosmic vibration of \"Aum\".

By the highest meditation the body loosens \nits atomic vibrations and becomes life-force, and by deeper meditation the astral body \nbecomes elaborated into the ideational body. Then by wisdom the ideational \nconsciousness becomes expanded into Christ consciousness. But it must be \nremembered that when the Yogi or Yogoda student listens to cosmic vibration, his \nmind is diverted from the physical sounds of matter outside his body to the circulatory \nsounds of the vibrating flesh. Then his consciousness is diverted from the vibrations \nof the body to the musical vibrations of the astral body. Then his consciousness \nwanders from the vibrations of the astral body to the vibrations of consciousness in all \natoms. Then the consciousness of the Yogi listens to the Holy Ghost or cosmic Sound \nemanating from all atoms. This is the way that ordinary consciousness should be \nbaptized or expanded into Christ consciousness through the expanding power of the \nHoly Ghost, or the all-spreading \"Aum-vibrating-sound\" heard in meditation by the \npractice of the Yogoda fifth lesson. \nWhen you utter \"Aum\" it travels not only all around the earth but throughout all space \nand eternity. So the sound emanating from the vibration of all atoms is called the Holy \nGhost or the Sacred Vibration. As above said, when by the practice of the fifth \nYogoda lesson one is able to shut out sounds of matter his consciousness passes \nthrough the vibrating sounds of the body and through the musical astral sounds to the \nsound of \"Aum\" or the \"Holy Ghost\".

In other words, Jesus \nfirst felt His body as the entire vibratory creation in which His little body was \nincluded; then feeling His cosmic finite body, he felt that within the cosmic body of \nall creation there was a Christ or Universal Intelligence.

Thus, Spirit having nothing \nelse but Itself began to create a Magic Delusion, or the cosmic Magical Measurer, \nwhich made the infinite look like the finite, even as the calm ocean becomes distorted \ninto ripples on its surface by the action of a storm.

It was imperfect because it wanted to accomplish something \nwhen that accomplishment was not necessary for the completion of the all-perfect \nSpirit. \nThis imperfect desire was the original thought vibration which divided the Spirit into \nmany through the law of duality.

As the one sheet of water of the calm sea is chopped \ninto many miniature pieces of water called waves, by the action of a third agent, the \nwind storm, so the conscious Cosmic, delusive, desireless desire of Spirit manifested \nitself as the independent conscious magical measurer, or the *Maya (Cosmic measurer \nof delusion) of the Hindu Scriptures, and was solely entrusted with the independent \npower of superficially dividing the Spirit into the perception of perfect finite objects \nmaterialized as icebergs of planets, wavelets of stars floating on the vast sea of \nInfinity.  \n"}

Without this urge, propagation of the human species would come to \nan end. God materialized everything in the beginning by direct special creative \ncommand, and man being made in His image has the same power. By yielding to \ntouch temptation man, before melting into the Infinite, lost this power of immaculate \ncreation by which he was able to clothe his mental pictures with energy and will and \nmaterialize children from the ether even as God did. God endowed man with this \nsame power in the beginning. \nMan and woman, instead of seeking emancipation in God through soul unity, sought \nunity through the flesh, and finally the action of the positive and negative forces \nproduced the creative organs and the inferior method of propagating the species by the \nact of repulsion instead of by the law of attraction involved in the united will power of \nman and woman. \nEver since the original misguided urge of Adam and Eve to seek creation through \nflesh was bequeathed to man, this lower power has been a temptation. This method is \nan inferior creative law of matter as compared to the superior law of immaculate \ncreation by will power. \nWhy Temptation Exists \nThe creative urge is the sign of our mental inheritance resulting from the original \npsychological defeat of our ancestors when their desire to create by Divine will power \nwas overpowered by the desire to create by flesh. Ever since, physical creating has \ntaken the place of creating by will. An original ancestral error in creating by flesh has \nbecome the present law of imperfect creation of undesirable children imposed upon \nman by the protoplasmic law of heredity. In mental creation, children should be \ncreated to order even as God created perfect beings endowed with free choice. Being \nDivine children, they inherited this free choice and then they misused that freedom \nand wandered away from God s perfect laws. Therefore, the germ of the original error \nof Adam and Eve, of substituting physical creation for will-creation remains in all \nhuman beings as the first temptation of the flesh against the immaculate laws of Spirit. \nEach individual since that time has had to engage his soul in battle with this Cosmic \ntemptation. \nThe Way to Overcome \nPersecution, gossip, commands, and taboos cannot remedy moral errors.

Over-eating, lack of personal hygiene, unwholesome \nsuggestions, unscientific instruction, immoral books, and lack of exercise reinforce \nthe pre-natal habits. \nProbably the strongest factor in reinforcing the post-natal habits of the child is wrong \nenvironment. These habits once formed lead him helplessly on to over-indulgence in \nmarried life, which habit entrenches itself on the territory of self-control, driving away \nthe habit of moderation and bringing in the pestilence of premature old age, disease, \nand loss of ambition and happiness in the kingdom of the body mind. Remember that \nupon waking and before sleeping, the youth and the adult should ask himself in \nintrospection: \"My self-control and moderate habits, while engaged in battle with my \npre-natal physical appetite and my post-natal greed, what did they? What has been the \nresult of their conflict? Has the right side won today? \nIf you are naturally victorious over physical greed or if you have acquired self-control \nby strenuous efforts, you have nothing to worry about, but if you find yourself being \ncarried away little by little a prisoner of temptation, then you should try to train your \narmies of self-control, seek good company, eat less and less meat, eat an abundance of \nfruit and vegetables, take strenuous exercise, and keep your thoughts busy with the \nwonder and peace of God. \nGossiping about the moral weaknesses of others is the most wicked of all spiritual \ncrimes. It breeds and develops hypocrisy in social and individual life. Remember what \nthe Lord said: \"He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone.\" \"Judge \nnot, that ye be not judged.\" Do not keep your mind busy with the unholy interest of \nthe weakness of others and thus rouse and stimulate your own pre-natal sleeping sex \nthoughts. \nKeep busy cleaning your own soul of the original temptation inherited from Adam \nand Eve.

He was to \nbehold the drama of change with a changeless immortal mind, and after seeing change \ndancing on the stage of changelessness, he was to return to the bosom of eternal \nblessedness, then evil crept in, causing man to concentrate on the changes of life and \non outward appearances rather than on the underlying immortality in all things, and \nthus made him conceive the false idea of death or complete annihilation. \nDestroying the Idea of Death \nThe motion picture of a man s life, his birth, life on earth, and death, seen on the \nscreen, produces the joyous consciousness of his birth and the sad concept of his \ndeath, or end, but Satanic ignorance hides from view the motion pictures of man s \npre-natal life as he joyously began the descent from God, and the joyous return to God \nas he hurried back after death. Satan has made us forget our pre-natal and post-natal \nexperiences, and by showing us for a time this drama of life and then lowering the \ncurtain, it has produced in us the erroneous conception called death. \n"}

To say that death or change does not exist, in unmetaphysical and erroneous. To \nforget this dismal, delusive death, man should behold all change as dancing on the \nbosom of changelessness. Man should behold the changeless ocean of Infinity as \nwavelets of change appearing and disappearing. \nSupernatural Death  Versus Painful Death \nIf Adam and Eve had not transgressed the wishes of God, and their descendants had \nnot allowed themselves to be influenced by hereditary ignorance, then modern man \nwould not have to witness the heartrending painful deaths through accident and \ndisease. \nMan appeared on earth, being materialized by God, and was to live on earth, \nbeholding the birth, sustenance, growth, and the painless, sorrowless, return of the \nbody in complete perfection. Than, as it is possible to watch the slow process of a \nflower budding, growing, and disappearing on the movie screen, so man should \nbehold his life pictured on the screen of his consciousness through the stages from \nchildhood to a full-grown individual, and then his disappearance unto God of his own \naccord by his own power of dematerialization. \nMan, being out of tune with God, has lost his power of dematerialization, so he is \nfrightened by the screen picture of life prematurely cut off even before he has finished \nseeing the whole perfect picture of his changeful life. This premature withdrawal of \nthe motion picture of life produces pain due to attachment to those screen pictures of \nflesh and consciousness and is known in the world as terrible death by pain. \nWe mortals have so many misconceptions about death that it has grown into \nimportance and has fixed in us an idea of annihilation and pain instead of being seen \nas a phenomena necessary in the successive steps which the soul must follow in order \nto return from the state of change to the changeless state. It is necessary for death or \nchange to come, so that the soul may finish beholding this motion picture of life and \nbe released in order to go back to the home of Immortality. \nHow Reincarnation Was Created by Satan \nSatan saw that it would all be very simple if the immortal children of God, after \nbeholding a perfect earthly existence with a changeless attitude, would go back to \nimmortality again, so Satan made imperfect patterns or tampered with the showing of \na perfect picture of life before it was completed, and caused mental and bodily pain \nthrough delusion.

Ever since, immortals have been coming and going from earth by the \nlaw of cause and effect, which governs desires. Ever since, this law of cause and \neffect has affected free souls as the law of Karma (action), which keeps them \nearthbound. \nThis law of cause and effect, which imprisons souls on earth in Satan s Kingdom of \nfinitude, has been called \"reincarnation.\" \nHow to Destroy Reincarnation \nImmortal souls can only expect to be free by utterly destroying all seeds of earthly \ndesires by Divine contact with God through meditation. This reminds the soul of the \nunending fulfillment in the immortal inheritances of Bliss which makes desires for \nearthly ways unnecessary and ridiculous. \nKnowledge of Wholeness \nEmancipation from reincarnation is also possible by playing the living drama of a \nperfect life of health, abundance, and wisdom on the screen of consciousness; that is, \nif one can remove the consciousness of sickness and not fear sickness if it does come, \nand not desire health while suffering from ill health, then one can remember one s \nsoul, which was always well and was neither sick nor healthy. If we can feel and \nknow that we are the children of God, and as such possess everything, even as our \nfather, God does, although we may be poor or rich, we can be free. If we can feel that \nwe have Divine knowledge, because we are made in the image of God, although \nhumanly speaking we know little\nthen we can be free from reincarnation. \nFear of sickness and a desire for mortal health, fear of poverty and a desire for \nopulence, a feeling of lack of knowledge as well as a desire to know everything, \nbelong to the domain of ignorance. Of course, if we are stricken with ill health, \nfailure, or ignorance, we need not continue to remain so. We should strive for health, \nprosperity, and wisdom without being afraid of failure.   \n"}

It is \nonly because he erroneously imagined, when in spiritually ignorant mortal company, \nthat he did not have these\nthat is why he lacked them. All he has to do is to think \nright and not strive to acquire things. He needs only to know that he already has \neverything. \nOnce a healthy, wealthy, and wise prince dreamed that he was poor, and in the dream \nhe shouted: \"Oh, I am suffering from cancer and I have lost all my wisdom and \nriches.\" His wife, the queen woke up and aroused him, saying: \"Look, prince, laugh \nand rejoice, for you are neither suffering from sickness nor have lost riches and \nwisdom, but you are comfortably lying at my side in health and wisdom, in your rich \nkingdom. You were only dreaming about these catastrophes.\" \nSo it is with ignorant man. He is dreaming about lack and failure, when he might \nclaim his birthright of joy, health, and plenty as a son of the ruler of the universe. He \nis now living in his perfect kingdom, but is dreaming evil. \nKnow God First \nThe constant desire for health and prosperity, which is so much harped upon in \nmodern spiritual organizations, is the way to slavery. We must seek God first and then \nfind health and prosperity through Him. Beggars get only a beggar s share, whereas, a \nson of God gets his son s share. That is why Jesus spoke of seeking and knowing the \nkingdom of God first. When that is actually accomplished, then health and prosperity \nwill be added. The acquirement of wisdom and everything else that the soul of man \nneeds will be received as a matter of his Divine birthright. \nIt is best to feel by visualization and by Divine contact in meditation that you are \nalready perfect in health and wisdom and have abundance, rather than try to succeed \nby begging for health, prosperity, and wisdom. In fact, man s mortal efforts are bound \nby the laws of cause and effect. Man cannot get more than he deserves. By the method \nof begging, no human being can ever fulfill all his endless desires, but by first \nrealizing his oneness with God, man can own everything he needs. \nMan cannot have immortality by begging for it or by feeling a desire for it. He should \nknow that he is already immortal and that so-called death is only a dream. \nAccording to the plan of God, man should have experienced growth from childhood, \nand through youth to manhood, but should never have experienced death by old age or \n"}

In the drama of life and death, when beheld with Divine understanding, there \ncan be no pain in death, but only the showing or stopping of the motion picture of life \nat will without physical or mental pain. \nOrigin of Pain \nThe outward flowing force which struggles to keep all things in manifestation saw \nthat without pain people would not create earthly desires to hold them here, so the \nillusion of pain was created, which is purely a mental phenomena. The pain of ill \nhealth and death creates the desire for health and life, and to have health and life the \nimmortal image of God must again and again return on earth to complete its slow \ngrowth from ignorance to enlightenment. \nSatan is defeating his own purpose, for it is physical pain and sorrow which cause \nmatter-imprisoned souls to seek freedom in God. A child s pure soul feels very little \npain. A doctor friend in an Orthopedic hospital told me that children vie with each \nother to get their deformed limbs operated upon, whereas, adults have to be coaxed for \nweeks, and at the time of their operation they are usually overcome with emotion and \nfear. \nMan has fortunately discovered anesthetics to neutralize pain. Originally man had \ngreat self-control and a mind which was unattached and impersonal, and so did not \nfeel pain when the body was injured. He could behold his own body without pain even \nas one can witness an operation on another s body without becoming mentally excited \nor suffering physical pain. \nAlthough a mother feels terrible agony when her own son dies, she does not feel the \nsame when hearing of the death of a stranger s son. So it is that man feels the agony \nof accident and disease in his own body but not the suffering of others. This is only \ndue to the proximity of continued attachment. The farmer s water-proof, fire-proof, \nless sensitive child feels much less physical suffering than the sensitively brought up \nson of the rich. If you have no fear or nervous imagination, you will feel less pain. \nJesus was tempted in the wilderness with the wild beasts of passion and the fierce \nmortal desires of pain and hunger for material kingdoms, sent by Cosmic Satan. \nIn the September issue will be explained a most unusual idea as to the origin of Evil, \nand if we were God would we create a better world.\n \nThe Bhagavad Gita  \n"}

In the mother s body the baby has to battle \nwith disease, darkness, and ignorance. Each child has to fight also the battle of \nheredity. The soul has to overcome many hereditary difficulties.

He can distinguish between pure \nsensation and the reaction of thought on it. He sees sensations, feelings, will, body, \nperception, everything in thought as suggestions of God dreaming through us. \nThe superman beholds the body not as flesh, but as a bundle of condensed electrons \nand life force ready to dematerialize or materialize at his will. He feels no weight of \nthe body. Body perceived as electric energy cannot have weight. He sees the motion \npicture of the cosmos going backward and forward on the screen of his consciousness, \nso he knows that time and space and dimension are forms of thought in which the \ncosmic motion picture of dreams is constantly playing new, true-to-touch, true-to-\nsound, visible super-talkies. \nThe superman sees birth as the beginning of certain changes and death as the change \nwhich follows earthly life.

This he does not do to be exclusive and negative, but \nto be all-inclusive. The yogi first excludes all attachments, so that they may not stand \nin the way of the perception of the omnipresent.

When attention and energy are withdrawn from \nthem, the heart, the muscles, and the senses are all consciously put to sleep, then a joy \ngreater than a thousand dreamless steeps is experienced after seven days of forced \nsleeplessness. \nThe consciousness of such a yogi sees visions, great lights, hears astral sounds, and \nbecomes identified with a vast dimly lighted space, alive with glimpses of the hitherto \nunknown. Then the yogi moves his consciousness and energy to the coccyx center, \nand he feels that all matter is composed of electricity. When he draws his \nconsciousness and energy to the sacral center, he feels that the earth is composed of \nelectrons and life force. When the yogi retires to the dorsal center, he sees all gases \nand air as made of life force. When the yogi can place his consciousness in the \ncervical center, he feels that all ether is made of sparks of intelligent life force. When \nthe yogi retires into the medulla center and the point between the eyebrows, he knows \nall matter, energy, and gases as composed of thought force. These centers are \nelectrical switches of life force and consciousness, which are responsible for the \ncreation of super-vitaphone pictures of earth, water, fire, and ether, of which matter is \ncomposed. This can be better understood by personal instruction from Guru \n(preceptor). \nSo many shallow spiritual people, whose knowledge comes percolating through books \nand not through intuition, speak of matter as thought when they are still grossly \nidentified with possessions and the body. Only yogis who know not by imagination \nbut in reality and who can withdraw consciousness as well as life force from the body \nby quieting the heart, and can take them through the plexuses to the point between the \neyebrows, are developed enough to say that all matter is thought.

God is good. We were made in His image, \nendowed with the gift of free choice to tune in with His Nature of Goodness, Peace, \nand Immortality, and those who get out of tune with Him by performing evil actions \nare bound to suffer. \nMany people say that evil resulted from the erroneous effort of trying to collide evil \nactions and pernicious ways of life with the wall of eternal good principles underlying \nall things in God, or from breaking God s laws. Then others say that evil arises not \nonly from trying to reconcile good and evil, but results also from the law of cause and \neffect; that man, although made in the image of God and receiving perfect \nindependence, misused it and acted in a way resulting in the collision with good, \nwhich produced evil. \nA little boy endowed with reason may enjoy perfect health and protection under the \nstrict discipline of his mother, but when he grows up and says: \"Mother, I know I am \nsafe under your care, but I wonder why you gave me the power of free choice if you \nare always to decide how I am to act?

If the baby uses reason rightly, it becomes happy, but if reason is misused, \nthen evil is precipitated through the misuse of reason. \nSubjective Origin of Evil \nMany intellectualists claim that evil is more subjective than objective. this is not \nwholly true. It can be explained that most evil is due to the ignorance of man. For \nexample, the habit of physical over-indulgence, and its consequent evils of \nindiscretion, ill health, and grip of temptation, does not arise until man, by an act of \nerroneous judgment, forgets himself and subjectively by repeated transgressions \nallows this consciousness to become a habit. \nAll habits, good or bad, control and enslave the mind only after the will has allowed \nitself to be overcome by repeated good or evil actions born of good or evil judgment, \nas the case may be. Thus it may be said, man s good judgment, and his will, acting \nunder its influence, produce all good, and man s ignorant or evil judgment, and his \nwill acting repeatedly under its influence, is responsible for all evil. From this \nviewpoint good and evil are mostly subjective instead of originating in some objective \npower. \nIt may be asked why some children are born with special tendencies of self-control \nand some with tendencies of weakness. Some intellectuals may point out that heredity \nis responsible for good or bad traits in a child. Then the question comes: Why would \nan impartial God start one child with a good heredity and a good brain inclined only to \ngood tendencies, and another child with a bad heredity and the brain of a moron \ninclined only to do evil under the compelling influence of evil physiological instincts? \nAccording to the law of reincarnation and the law of karma, or the law of cause and \neffect, which governs the actions of all persons, it is explained that the soul attracts to \nitself a good or bad heredity, and a good or bad brain, according to pre-natal habits \nformed during the period of the past incarnation preceding death in the last \nincarnation and rebirth in this life. Therefore, it may be said that the good or bad \njudgment of all incarnations, working through the law of cause and effect, which \ngoverns all human actions, creates good or bad habits, and that good or bad habits \ncreate good or bad hereditary tendencies, and that thus all evil arises from wrong \njudgment. \n"}

The animal \nexpresses Spirit more than the plant, for the animal can cover a greater portion of \nspace by bodily movements.

This is one \nreason why fasting is helpful in attaining a state of quiet and freedom from body \nconsciousness. People who eat too much and never fast, keep the Life Force in their \nbodies busy burning carbon and cleansing venous blood, and they thus overwork the \nheart and keep the five-sense telephones forever active. \nWhen a long meditation of several days is desired, a fruit diet is to be recommended \nbecause it contains less carbon than the ordinary varied diet. It also satisfies the bodily \nbad habit of continuous eating and is better for most people than complete fasting. \nSuch partial fasting by a group of people, accompanied by long meditation, can give a \ntremendous spiritual experience. This experiment should be undertaken only under the \nstrict guidance of a wise preceptor or guru. \nMeditation is the method of connecting the life Force with Cosmic Energy, and this \ncan be accomplished only when all bodily functions are slowed up. Therefore, \nmeditating when the stomach is full defeats the very purpose for which one meditates. \nWith a full stomach, the heart, nervous system, and the five-sense telephones are all \nbusy digesting food, burning carbon, and keeping up the circulation in the body. This \nkeeps the subconscious mind busy and in turn makes the conscious mind restless, and \nthus prevents it from becoming one-pointed and concentrated on God. \nOn the other hand, to meditate when the stomach is empty is a good practice because \nthe energy which runs the nervous system is not then busy with the bodily functions. \nWhen the body, lungs, and diaphragm are still, the heart is calm. When the heart is \ncalm, the current is switched off from the five-sense telephones. \nTherefore, fasting in connection with meditation means the slowing up of activity in \nthe muscles, heart, circulation, diaphragm, and lungs by denying carbon and \nchemicals to the blood. Hence, fasting helps to draw the attention away from the body \nand its functions, and metaphysically it helps to open up the inner source of Cosmic \nConsciousness and Cosmic Energy by which the body really lives. \nJesus said: \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out \nof the mouth of God.\" Man s body battery is not sustained by sunshine, oxygen, and \nfood alone, but by the word or vibrating current of Cosmic Energy which, by radio-\nactive force descends into the body and human will through the medulla, or \"mouth of \nGod.\" Not to use the will, as some people teach, is to shut off all Divine currents from \nthe body. \n"}

Joseph Schrembs, D.D., Bishop of \nCleveland, delivered Feb. 12, 1928, and reprinted from the Catholic Universe \nBulletin, Cleveland, Ohio, (eleventh edition) we find striking facts about Teresa \nNeumann s life relative to living by Divine Energy. \n(1) \"She possesses the wounds of the Crucified Savior. The wounds remain always the \nsame. They neither fester nor heal.\" \n(2) \"She goes through the Passion of our Lord each Friday.\" \n(3) \"She repeats the Aramaic words spoken by Christ.\" \n(4) \"She divines the innermost secret of the heart.\" \n(5) \"She takes neither food nor drink. Has eaten no solid food since 1923, except \nwater or a little fruit juice.\" \nBut on Christmas Day of the year 1926 she ceased entirely taking any food or any \ndrink, so that almost for two years now, this girl has neither eaten nor drunk anything \nexcept to receive Holy Communion every morning. Now, it may be that you will say \nPerhaps she takes food on the sly. Perhaps this is all deception. No. It is guaranteed. \nIt is absolutely certified. The Episcopal Government of the city of Ratisbon has sent \nfour hospital sisters who were placed under oath to watch her night and day. These \nsisters changed off in pairs and never left her presence.

Teresa Neumann shows that her Divine Will can replace the decayed bodily \ntissues by materializing electrons of energy into flesh. \nMany Hindu saints have demonstrated that life is possible without oxygen or food. \nSadu Haridas, of India, conducted an experiment under the observation of medical \nmen and was buried several feet beneath the surface of the earth for forty days, in the \ncourtyard of a well-guarded palace, and came back to life even though he was \npronounced dead. \nThese extreme examples are cited, not in order to make you aspire to become another \nHaridas, or Teresa Neumann, but simply to show that if such great control of the \nphysical being is possible, it is also possible for a person living a normal life to so \nspiritualize his body that he can be free from physical suffering, and that he can \nactually know through experience that Divine Power is the real source of his life. \nOf course, long fasting, that is, more than three days, is not necessary in order to \ndemonstrate that you really live by Divine Power. You can also spiritualize the body, \nor make it live on this higher plane, by right eating at all times. The proper diet should \nbe chosen and care should be taken never to overeat. It is a good plan to go without \nbreakfast, eat a normal meal at noon, and very little, if anything, at night. Morning and \nevening are the usual periods for meditation. \nWhen fasting, mental resistance and fear of losing weight should be overcome, and \nthe whole attention should be put upon the spiritual purpose for which the fast is \nundertaken. During this time, you must feel alive with Cosmic Consciousness and the \nnewly awakened Life Energy. \nJesus discovered this new source of energy through fasting and meditation. He also \nfound that He had conquered the race-habit and the race-idea of the necessity of living \nby physical food alone. The Cosmic Delusive Force has led man to believe that he \nwould die without physical food and the body consciousness. Jesus refused to convert \nthe stone into bread because He knew that He lived by the power of the changeless \ninfinite Energy and not alone by the limited relative energy derived from physical \nfood. \nDuring fasting, you should say to yourself and actually realize: \"I am learning to live \nby the power of God and not by physical means only.\" Everyone should test out this \ntruth in his or her own life by long fasting and long meditation, and thus prove, as \nJesus did, that man lives by Divine Power, and that by the proper effort he can \nbecome aware of God Consciousness and Cosmic Energy. \n"}

The soul \ndescends from omnipresent Spirit to the little body, and, being identified with the \nimperfections of the body, it loses its omnipresent, perfect states and has to battle with \nall the limitations of the physical system. \nIt has been shown that the soul must do away with all identification with both the \ngood and bad conditions to which the body and life are subjected. The first step \nconsists in trying to conquer greed by cultivating the desire to succeed and to make \nmoney in the right way only. Also, the soul should conquer sense cravings by \ncultivating self-control; should conquer fear of ill-health by cultivating desires and \nactivities which make good health. \nThe second and higher step consists in rising above all personal desire, such as that for \nmoney, mental power, and physical health. In the final analysis, a man is not yet a \nmaster who has still to battle with life, blood chemicals, sense-psychology, \ntemptation, or ignorance. While experiencing the different forms of material, \npsychological, biological, ethical, and spiritual battles, the soul must ask itself each \nnight in introspection: \"The soldiers of the higher faculties, after eagerly battling the \nsoldiers of the lower faculties, what did they?\" \nThe spiritual interpretation of the first stanza ends with the description of the chemical \nand hereditary battles which the soul has to win in order to attain the changeless state \nin which health and disease, life and death, and all the pairs of opposites, appear like \nwaves of change rising and falling on the ocean-bosom of changelessness. \nDisease is the sailing of the boat of life in the stormy sea of existence. Health is \nswimming in the gently-stirred sea of Being. Wisdom consists in jumping out of the \nboat of flesh limitation and becoming one with the sea of Life. As long as we \nconcentrate wholly on the changing waves of health or disease, of life or death, so \nlong do we forget to watch the changeless sea of all-protecting Spirit. \n"}

About \nsixteen square feet of food-receiving surface is found in the small intestines, from \nwhich the food materials are taken into the blood and the lymph.

The human \nplasma is agreeable to its own red corpuscles, but when blood of a different animal is \nmixed with it, the red cells die. Animals closely related do not suffer ill effects when \ntheir blood is mixed. It is a very strange fact that man s blood agrees when mixed with \nthe blood of anthropoid apes or with blood of a different race. In blood transfusions, \nthere is no such thing as wrong mixture of blood between the brown, white, yellow, or \nred races, for all men have one blood and all are made in the image of God. \nUnder the microscope, it is seen also that the blood contains numerous little discs or \nwhite corpuscles. These act like amoebae. The red corpuscles in the blood are the \nservants who carry oxygen to the whole body. In the same blood, also, the white \ncorpuscles act as white soldiers who arrest any intruding bacteria. The white cell \nimmediately attacks any intruding bacteria, enfolds them in a death-grip and digests \nthem. \nWhenever there is a wound, malignant bacteria begin their work, but the white \ncorpuscles, led by the conscious general, Life Force, gather together to defend the \nbroken castle wall of tissues. These white corpuscles have a sort of chemical intuition \nand they mobilize in the parts which are threatened with the invasion of malignant \nbacteria. \nThe great battle between the white corpuscles and the harmful bacteria results in battle \nheat or feverishness on the part of the patient. If the white corpuscles win, the battle \nfor health is won, but sometimes, when the dangerously multiplying bacteria win, the \nbody is ravaged with serious sickness. Bacteria produce a poison or toxin which \ndestroys the chemical balance of the blood. On the other hand, the blood produces a \ncounter-agent or anti-toxin to destroy the power of bacterial toxins. From dead \nbacteria a sort of chemical or an opsonin is formed which serves as a stimulant and \nencourages the soldiers of white corpuscles to fight disease. \nTherefore, anyone desiring health should live in such a way hygienically as to make \nhis body immune to disease.

By energizing \nthe muscles, the white and red blood corpuscles are specially charged with vital force. \nThis electrification of blood cells helps to make them immune to disease and helps to \nsurround them with a charged barbed wire of life force which electrocutes all invading \ninimical bacteria.

THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST \n\"Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil. \nAnd when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward hungered. And \nwhen the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that \nthese stones be made bread. But Jesus answered and said, It is written, Man shall not \nlive by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God .\"\nMatt. 4:1-4. \nAFTER having described last month how Theresa Neumann\n \nis now living by the \nword (vibratory, Cosmic Energy) of God, and not by bread, this article continues with \nan explanation of the phenomena of hunger, and its origin. As has been said before, \nthe metaphysical Cosmic Satan, once having the independent power to create by the \nlaw of relativity, does not want finite things to return to God, as at the end of a storm, \nthe waves, after a perfect individual existence, peacefully dissolve into, and become \npart of the sea again. \nReincarnation \nSatan saw that the Divine plan was for all finite creation, after a perfect existence, to \ngo back to God, and he knew that with the disappearance of all finite creation, his \nkingdom would be gone, so he determined to use his God-given power to create \nimperfect independent desires in finite creatures in order to make them come back to \nearth again and again through reincarnation. \nSatan created the consciousness of death through accident or fear, and thus started a \ndesire in human beings for a perfect life on earth. This desire caused souls to \nreincarnate again and again in their vain hope of finding a perfect existence on earth, \nwhich can only be found in God. \nGod is almighty. He could destroy Satan, but if He used His physical miraculous \nforce, He would subjugate Satan, but would not convince his immortal intelligence of \nhis evil ways, so God is using love to convert Satan. As Satan is trying to keep human \nbeings deluded by greed, anger, fear, desire, attachment, and delusion, so God is using \nthe psychological counterparts of unselfishness, calmness, courage, satisfaction, \nunattached Divine Love, and wisdom, to bring man to His Divine Kingdom.    \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 96, "text": "Evil \nThere was no evil in God. Satan precipitated evil by the misuse of his God-given free \nchoice, and his power of creating finite things. God might have anticipated the origin \nof evil in Satan through His omniscience, yet He organized this Cosmic Play in order \nto enjoy Himself through His many selves, and because He knew that, ultimately, His \ngoodness would bring all things back unto Him. After God gave independent power to \nSatan, who had been an archangel, to create perfect finite things, Satan mis-used his \nindependence, as a rebellious general sometimes turns against his King. Ever since \nthen Satan has created an ugly counterpart for every beautiful creation of God, in \nman s body, mind, and soul, and in Nature. God created a beautiful body to be \ncharged by Cosmic Energy, and to live in a free, unconditioned, Divine state, but \nSatan created hunger, and the lure of the senses. For mental power, Satan substituted \nmental temptation; for soul s wisdom, Satan invented delusive ignorance; for \nbeautiful Nature, Satan substituted ugly warfare, disease, germs, earthquakes \ncataclysms, floods, and other disasters. \nIf there were no individual and industrial greed, selfishness, sex temptation, nor false \nambitions, this earth would be free from physical and moral crimes and war. By these \nmisfortunes, Satan is systematically fighting God s perfect plans of unselfishness, \ninternational cooperation, self-control, and true ambition, which includes the \nhappiness of other people in one s own happiness, brotherhood, and so on. \nLiving by God-Power \nWhy must God s children be hungry? The soul, identified with the Satan-desecrated \nhuman body, feels hungry, and in turning to the earth-products for nourishment, \nremains earth-bound. Thus, the soul forgets that it can live like God by God s Cosmic \nEnergy. \nJesus, as he contacted God, found that hunger is a delusion connected with the law of \nchange in the body, and can be overcome gradually until one can live entirely by \nGod s energy. Man should behold the soul as above hunger and the desire for food, \nfor as long as the soul feels dependent upon food, it is earth-bound, and so long must \nit come back again and again to satisfy this flesh desire. This does not mean that the \nspiritual aspirant should stop eating, but it does mean that he should joyously eat to \nmaintain the temple of God (the body) and not eat just to satisfy sense craving.  \nEven when Jesus said that stones could be made into bread by changing their rate of \nelectronic vibration, he realized that it would be foolish to remember and encourage \nhis mortal habits when tempted by Satan, since he knew that he was immortal and \ncould live by God-power. Stones can be changed into bread when man understands \n"}

God s intelligence has divided \nvibrations into solids, liquids, and gases, and is holding them in balance by mind, \nthermal, and electrical laws. \nMan must understand how his intelligence controls the atoms of his body. When he \nlearns that, he will find that his intelligence is a reflection of Divine Intelligence, \nwhich supports the life of his body. When he understands that, he knows that his body \nis not maintained by the physical law of bread only, but that it is sustained principally \nby God s Cosmic Energy. So Jesus controlled his mortal enemy of hunger by His \nDivine Memory of unconditioned spiritual existence, which is self-sustaining. \nThe Cosmic Satan, through past mortal memory, asked Jesus to use his Divine power \nover atoms to change stones into bread. Satan wanted Jesus to forget his newly \nremembered Divine State of unconditioned existence. So Satan worked through the \nmind of Jesus, and said: \"Why don t you use your Divine power to change stones into \nbread?\" If Jesus had done that, he would have misused his Divine power, and also \nwould have again catered to the Satanic psychology of physical hunger, instead of \nliving by Cosmic Energy. \nIf Jesus had converted stones into bread, he would have had to depend again on bread \nfor life. Of course, Jesus humanly ate bread even after this experience, but he did it as \na God-man, and not as a deluded human being, subject to physical hunger. Great \nsouls, who attain the highest, do not use their miraculous power for themselves, but \nlive in the common human way, so that they may attract people to God by the higher \nmiracles of love and devotion, and not by ostentatious physical miracles. \nBy not yielding to Satan s temptation to turn stones into bread, Jesus conquered, and \nfrom then on it was at His option to live with or without food. Jesus found that a Son \nof God should not test God, for that is to doubt Him. God s power should not be used \nto satisfy the challenge of unbelievers, unless so commanded by God Himself. For \nthose who see the miracles of God, there is nothing left to disbelieve. It is those who \nbelieve in God s power without seeing, who deserve to behold the miracles of God. \nSo Jesus answered within himself with a great vibratory force of thought, to the \nmetaphysical Satan, who was tempting Him to transgress God s laws. The word \n\"said\" signifies vibrating thought, and not a speaking voice. Jesus quoted the \nscriptural truth, not theoretically, as so many theologians do, but after his own \nexperience of finding the mystery and origin of life through a forty-day fast, and by an \nintense inner meditative preparation. Man does not need to depend upon bread, or \nsolids, liquids, and gases only for sustaining life, but upon the vibrating Cosmic \nEnergy proceeding from the medulla (Mouth of God) into the human system. \n"}

Evil existed from the time the Cosmic Satanic force first \nmisused the Cosmic Energy to create imperfect things and beings. Even when Adam \nand Eve were created, Satan foresaw that if they remained perfect on earth, and were \ndematerialized and drawn back into God, there would be nothing left for him to do, \nand he would lose his power, so, even in that early period, Satan had already turned \nagainst God, and had created such patterns of imperfection as physical temptation, to \nmake Adam and Eve transgress the perfect laws and become earth-bound through the \ncreation of imperfect desires. \nAdam and Eve, by yielding to Satan s temptation of physical procreation, lost the \npower of immaculate creation, by materializing their tendencies and energy into \nDivine children, even as God had especially created them out of the ether. All creation \nis special in the beginning, and physical creation is secondary, for male and female \nmust first exist before physical creation is possible. \nFrom then on, the law of reincarnation became effective from the outworking of \nhuman desires on the earth plane by rebirth. Satan created this law because he wanted \nsouls to be bound to the earth by earthly desires. \nCause of Reincarnation \nReincarnation originated principally from Satan trying to immortalize changeable \nflesh in order to keep creatures under his subjugation. Satan found, however, that flesh \nwas subject to the law of change, which included the change of the state called death. \nFinal Freedom \nSouls, being immortal, could not go back to God, with the imperfect desires \nengendered on earth by Satan, so they had to return to earth, through reincarnation, to \nwork out their material desires. In a way, Satan is helplessly acting as the tool of God \nin ultimately freeing souls from Body and earth attachment. Reincarnation assures \nfreedom, for it gives immortal souls time to work out their past desires. In that way \nSatan is deceived into thinking that souls will remain earthbound forever, whereas, at \nthe expiration of the incarnation of desires, they will be liberated. \nWhen a soul incarnates to work out its desires of past incarnations, Satan, fearing the \nfreedom of that individual at the end of the working out of those desires, creates new \ndesires in this incarnation by ingenious temptations, so that the soul may keep on \nreincarnating by weaving fresh nets of desires. Reincarnation, forced by earthly \ndesires, is painful, and wrought with suffering, and is the tool of Satan to keep souls \nearthbound and miserable. \n"}

Satan made souls think death was a \nparting from the beautiful earth, and as such, that they should grieve and desire to \ncome back.

In the mother s body the baby has to battle \nwith disease, darkness, and ignorance. Each child has to fight also the battle of \nheredity. The soul has to overcome many hereditary difficulties. It has also to contend \nwith the self-created influencing effect of the pre-natal Karma or past actions. See \nJune East-West\n \nfor complete spiritual interpretation of first stanza. \nTHE accompanying charts show the clash between the Ego, holding the five \nsearchlights of sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch, and the Soul, holding the five \nGod-revealing super inner searchlights. \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 100, "text": "Man s soul holds two bundles of inner and outer searchlights. The soul, which is \nreally ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new, individualized Bliss-Spirit, and its pure \nreflection, withdraws, during deep meditation, its limited matter-identified attention, \nwith the power of the inner eye of attention. The soul beholds, through the \nsearchlights of astral visions, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, the territory of \nOmnipresent Cosmic Consciousness, and its blessed boundlessness. \nIn this state, Prince Soul, freed from the intoxications of delusion and illusive mortal \nhabits, thinks of all the twinkling atoms of Cosmic Energy as his own eyes. He enjoys \nthe fragrance of Bliss in everything, along with the astral fragrance. He tastes the \nastral nectar of liquid, Cosmic Energy. He feels his voice vibrate, not in a human \nthroat, or body, but in the throat of all vibrations, in his body of all finite matter. In its \nown state, the soul, as pure reflection of Spirit, instead of feeling the little body as the \npseudo-soul, or ego, feels its blood of perception run through all the veins in the body \nof all finite vibratory Creation. \nSoul and Ego \nNow then, we find that Prince Soul, when deluded and tempted by Cosmic Delusion, \nor psychological Satan, becomes the limited ego. When Prince Soul identifies with the \nbody, and its material relatives and possessions, it becomes the deluded ego. The soul, \nas the ego, ascribes for itself all the limitations and titles of the body with which it is \nidentified. In the ego-state, Prince Soul, being identified with the slum of matter, \nimagines himself poor and limited, just as a rich prince, wandering and living in the \nslums, might imagine himself to be poor. \nOuter and Inner Sight \nThe soul, as ego, has its attention identified with the outer searchlights of the five \nsense of sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch, and beholds only the limitations of \nmatter. A searchlight reveals only objects in front of it, not behind. The matter-bound \nsearchlights of the senses, turned toward matter, reveal only the limitations of matter \nin front of them, and not the vast Kingdom within. In the ego state, the Soul sees not \nthe beautiful Cosmic Energy in every speck of space, but only the limitations of \nhuman faces, flowers, and the beauty of Nature. On the other hand, the soul coaxes its \nattention to turn its searchlight inward, and behold, through its astral vision, the ever-\nburning, ever-changing, multicolored lights of the fountain of cosmic Energy, playing \nthrough the powers of all atoms. \nThe beauty of a face, or of Nature, is fleeting, and depends upon the power of the \nphysical eyes. The beauty of Cosmic Energy is everlasting, and can be seen with or \nwithout the physical eyes. The astral beauties of roses, scenery, and heavenly faces, \n"}

They were ideal \nlovers, the envy of all the class. I said to them: \"I am very fond of you both, but I do \nnot envy you, though your youth, beauty, and love are the envy of most people. Some \nday you will envy me.\" Whenever they sat talking with me, being swayed by the \nbreeze of love, they would bring their faces together, like two half-opening roses, \nwhispering fragrance and beauty under the spell of the gentle breeze. The boy was \ndreamy, well formed, beautiful, and so was the girl. \nIt was a perfect match. He said: \"If only I could get a job, we would be supremely \nhappy. Please pray for me.\" And I answered, feeling that my prayer was heard: \"You \nshall have a job, but at the end of a year I shall visit you and see if that is all you need \nto make you happy. I will compare my love with my Beloved Omnipresence, who \nsings to me through stars, atoms, and nightingales, with your limited human love.\" A \nbaby was about to come. \nOne year later, God took me to them. The boy came out of a grocery store. His back \nwas bent, his brow was wrinkled, and he said with a bedraggled smile: \"I got a job all \nright, but it is such hard work. However, I still believe in God.\" Then I saw his wife. \nAnother baby was coming. All her smiles were gone. She greeted me with a tired, \nworried face, and said: \"I never see my husband any more. He is in the store from \neight in the morning until eight in the evening. The baby cries all the time.

In this \nstate, the soul no longer revels in imitation perfumes, the lure of material greed for \nfood, and sense pleasure. It lives by its own Divine energy, and its eternal, living state, \nand does not think it must depend upon physical food only. \nLast of all, the ego battles to keep attention a prisoner in the domain of touch. The \nphysical plane has promised happiness, but has given only ill health, and hastened old \nage, nervousness, disease, and death. The sense of touch has given only enslaving \nbody comforts, which has made it always afraid of hurt and exertion.

Just as ships can be \ncontrolled by a distant radio, so the Cosmic Consciousness of God keeps all thoughts \nand cells alive in the body by continually sending energy to them. \nDuring the suspended state of the body, unless the cell and thought radios are tuned in \nwith Cosmic Consciousness, or with the superconsciously-charged subconscious, the \ncells and bodily functions will be destroyed because of the lack of a controlling \nintelligence. Human conscious intelligence, charged with God Consciousness, is the \nsupreme sustainer of the body. Without that, no human body can live; so, in the \nsuspended states of the body, the super-consciously - charged subconsciousness \nwithdraws the Life Force from the organs and unites it with Cosmic Energy, to \nelectrify all the body cells and convert them into dry batteries. When the cells are \nelectrified with this super-current, they cease to grow or to decay. This is what is \nmeant by \"suspended animation.\" The Life Force and human consciousness cease \ntheir outward activity with the material world, and temporarily suspend their slavery \nto oxygen, food, and sunshine, and learn to depend wholly upon the true body \nsupports, Cosmic Consciousness and Cosmic Energy. The Yogis suspend the activity \nof change in the muscles, blood, nerve force, and all tissues, and support the body by \nthe changeless power of Cosmic Consciousness and Cosmic Energy. \nThe body, being a cluster of atomic, cellular, circulatory, muscular, astral, electrical \nmotions, depends usually upon such motion for its existence, but when the animation \nis suspended in the right way, the body is charged by the Cosmic Source. If you gently \ntouch the spring of a fine watch, it will stop, and when you shake the watch, it will run \nagain. In the same way, when the heart is stopped, by stilling the activity of thoughts, \nthe animation of the body is suspended. \nWhile buried, the cold earth acts like a refrigerator, preserving the body from the work \nof heat. Besides, the inner Life Force creates a sort of coolness in all the cells, which \nserves to preserve them by direct current from Cosmic Consciousness and Cosmic \n"}

In this state, the cells temporarily forget their bad habit as food addicts, and \nthey live by the Word, or the vibration of cosmic Consciousness and Energy. \nTo return to activity, the Yogi takes his will and consciousness into the spine and \nbrain. Then he puts in the switch of the will, and the thoughts begin to stir. With the \nconnecting of the switches of the thoughts, the life force begins to bring animation \ninto the body again. \nBesides the above, it is a known fact that each gram of flesh in the human body has \nenough energy in the electro-protonic center to run the electrical supply of the city of \nChicago for two days. The Life Force in the ordinary human body usually derives \npower from the chemical energy in food. It does not know how to live on the electro-\nenergy stored in the protonic center in food atoms. In the state of suspended \nanimation, some Yogis, instead of drawing on Cosmic Energy by disintegrating atoms \nthrough the power of will, release the electro-protonic heat to keep the body cells \nelectrified like billions of dry batteries. \nRecharging the Body Battery \nGood electricity is extremely necessary in maintaining a battery. In the same way, the \nbody battery needs to be inwardly charged with good thoughts, wisdom, and Cosmic \nEnergy. Dietetics is not delusion. Distilled water (and not any kind of water) is \nnecessary for the life of the battery; so, also, good food, pure oxygen, through proper \nbreathing, sunshine, and less carbon-forming foods, are necessary for the proper \nupkeep of this body battery. The body is a battery within batteries. \nThe body battery is charged outwardly by good food, chemicals, and so forth, and \ninwardly by pure mind, pure soul, Cosmic Consciousness, and Life Energy. The body \nbattery is contained in the mind and soul batteries. \nRecharging the Mind and Soul Batteries \nThe mind battery is charged by Life Energy, bodily chemicals from the outside, and \ninwardly it is charged by super-consciousness of the soul. A weak, dilapidated body \nweakens the mind, but a healthy body does not always mean a remarkable mind, \nunless it is charged with superconsciousness of the soul. Likewise, the soul battery is \ncharged with a good mind, good Life energy, and good chemical energy of the body \nfrom the outside, and inwardly the soul is charged by Cosmic Consciousness through \nthe channel of the superconscious. \nIn other words, remember that the more you daily meditate deeply, and feel your joy \nincreasing, the more your soul battery will be recharged with daily wisdom poured out \n"}

The more one meditates, keeps in the company of Saints and intelligent, \nmentally-powerful people, reads good books, introspects, does creative work in art, \nscience, literature, and business, the more one feels mentally powerful. \nThen last of all, it must be remembered that, since the soul has descended into matter \nfrom Spirit, and made the imperfect body its playground, all the perfection of Spirit \nand soul and mind must be centered in the body in order to enable the flesh-entangled \nsoul to remember its vastness in Spirit. \nA diseased body discourages the soul, due to the latter identifying itself with the \nformer. A strong soul, which finds its joy in meditation, on the other hand, can \ninfluence a disease-stricken body to manifest healing and perfection. \nThe soul s battle for immortality, diseaselessness, and everlasting happiness, must be \nwon and established in the body, at least from the mental standpoint, before the soul \ncan disentangle its attachment from the mortal, imperfect condition of the body. A \nspiritual man, unless highly advanced, eating food injudiciously, would find the body \nstanding in the way of spiritual realization. Also, a food fanatic will find the thought \nof the body hindering spiritual realization. \nEat the right food and then forget that you live by food. Think that you are always \nliving by Cosmic Energy and Cosmic Consciousness, which changes the food into \nenergy. You must realize that food alone cannot support the body, whereas, in the \nstate of suspended animation, the body can be sustained by the consciousness and \nsubconsciousness in the brain and spine. No one can live without the inner \nintelligence of subconsciousness drawing energy from the protonic center of cells, or \nCosmic Energy. When consciousness departs from the spine and brain in the \nsuspended, or dead body, death is instantaneous, and decay starts. \nIn the case of Theresa Neumann, mentioned in the November issue of East-West, we \nfind one of God s many miracles. She is slightly active, breathes, enjoys sunshine, has \nher heart and circulatory system working, but she does not live by bread, water, and so \nforth. This is most unique. She is demonstrating in this age the teaching of Jesus, \nnamely that the body does not have to live by bread alone, but that it can live by the \nvibrating energy of God, sent through the sunshine, oxygen, and the Life Force, into \nthe body. Of course, very few persons in the world have lived by sunshine and oxygen \nonly. Saint Theresa Neumann lives by her will, drawing Cosmic energy, and by the \nCosmic Consciousness of Christ. \nSaint Theresa Neumann is sent by God to demonstrate that the future food of man will \ncome through oxygen, sunshine, and etheric energy.

On the \nother hand, Theresa Neumann apparently has to depend a little upon mortal breath and \nsunshine. Yogis of India, in the suspended state, live only by Cosmic Energy, and do \nnot depend upon oxygen and sunshine. \nThe suspended state is not the highest state, however. When a Yogi can at will remain \nconscious and active without breath and sunshine, and can live, then he is known to \nmake the body live by God, and by the Word of God (Cosmic Energy) alone. Yogis \nwho can do this are much higher than those who remain in the suspended state only. \nSaint Theresa Neumann s state is a higher state than the Yogi s, (who remain \nsubconsciously alive only in suspended animation,) in that she consciously lives \nwithout eating and is active and breathing. There is an even higher state than this. \nSome Yogis live consciously only through God and Cosmic Consciousness (Word of \nGod). Jesus could do this. He ate only to be human. By the manifestation of Cosmic \nConsciousness during His forty days of fasting, He attained this. Therefore, He said: \n\"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the \nmouth of God.\" Yogis, after attaining the above state, may not eat at all, or they may \neat to remain human, and thus help out this drama of life. \nRight Eating and Spiritual Development \nThe spiritual aspirant, however, must eat rightly. He should eat less carbonized food, \nand very little in the morning and evening, the times of meditation. Most kinds of \nmeat and heavy food keep the Life Force busy working in the vital organs, burning \ncarbon, and therefore it is difficult to disengage the active Life Force from the senses \nand vital organs, and to reverse the current and attention toward God, without \nretarding digestion and receiving opposition from the vital organs. \nMeditation, after heavy meals, in the early stages, sets up a tug of war between the \nbody consciousness and superconsciousness. That is why fruits, containing less \ncarbon, are better than most heavy meats, like pork and beef, since fruits, having less \ncarbon to burn, do not use much Life Force, and do not tax the nervous system, vital \norgans, kidneys, and so on. The heavy meat eater will find the mind pulled down to \nthe region of the senses during meditation. In the morning eat fruits, at noon eat a \ngood meal, (whatever you want) at night fruits, milk, and cooked vegetables. \nFast once a week on orange juice and meditate. Fast three days consecutively on \norange juice every month, or every forty-five days, and meditate long and deeply (two \nor three hours). This will not only give rest to the body, and eliminate poisons, but it \nwill teach you how to live more by Cosmic Consciousness, and less by food. \nConcentrate during fasting.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 112, "text": "Material Desire reigns supreme in the person who does not meditate. Material Desire \nis the king of all sense tendencies, because it is desire which lures discrimination to \nfollow the sense pleasure of idleness, bodily comfort, and so forth, instead of \nfollowing soul happiness, which consists in all-round peace of mind. As soon as \nmeditation awakens discriminative qualities, King Material Desire becomes extremely \nafraid of losing his hold in the kingdom of life and tries to reinforce himself by \nrecalling the pleasures of past evil habits. \nKing Material Desire by himself is easily overcome by an act of judgment, but \nMaterial Desire, that has been ripened into habit, is hard to eject by discrimination, so \nKing Material Desire tries to overcome discriminative tendencies by luring them with \nthe memory of past evil habits, and the joy which they yielded. It is easy to conquer a \nmaterial desire, but hard to conquer material habits. That is why we find that the \nspiritual aspirant, who tries to meditate, will be bothered, not only with new desires to \ngo for distraction to shows or plays, or eat, or while away time in idle talk, or sleep, or \nlaziness, or to travel, or to go after money, and so on, but he will also be invaded by \nstrong habits of the body, such as restlessness, idle talking, sleep, amusements, bodily \nenjoyments, and pernicious habits of spiritual indifference. The spiritual aspirant \nshould be aware of this. \nDrona, or Past Habits \nAccording to the historical story, Drona was the preceptor who had taught archery to \nthe wicked Kurus, and to the good Pandus, but during the battle between the two \nparties he sided with the Kurus. Drona represents Intelligence, influenced by past \ngood or bad actions. The good discriminative tendencies, or Pandus, and the wicked \nmental tendencies, or Kurus, both learned the art of wielding the piercing power of \ngood or evil during a psychological battle, but as a bird cannot focus the vision of \nboth its eyes on the same object at the same time, but has to see with one eye at a \ntime, so Intelligence, born of habits, (Drona) unless purified by wisdom, usually \nfollows Durjodhana, or King Material Desire. That is why this bad-habit-influenced \nIntelligence sided with the wicked mental tendencies, and helped them to use their \narrows of piercing evil power against the psychologically prepared discriminative \npowers. \nBeware, devotee! As soon as you try to meditate and rouse the powers of self-control \nand discrimination, you will find King Material Desire, and the wicked mental \ntendencies, trying to rouse the memory of your bad habits of possible sense pleasure, \nor spiritual indifference (Drona) and to give battle to the forces of discrimination. In \nother words, as soon as the devotee tries to find happiness in meditation, he finds \nhimself tempted by memories of sense pleasures, and is often led to restlessness. \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 113, "text": "According to deep spiritual introspective intuition, the devotee who tries to meditate, \nfinds that King Material Desire calls the material habits to behold the mighty armies \nof spiritual perceptions (Pandus) of calmness, vitality, self-control, and so forth, \narrayed in the spinal plexuses and brain, ready to give battle to the tendencies of greed \nand sex-temptation, located on the outer surface of the body. The ordinary \nindividual s consciousness is usually located on the outer surface of the body. He is \nidentified with the palate, with feelings of physical comfort and idleness, with nice, \nsweet words, falling intoxicatingly on the ear drums, with the enticements of beautiful \nobjects, and with the lures of physical fragrance. \nBy indulging in the sense pleasures constantly, the ordinary individual becomes sense-\nensnared. He finds himself enjoying on the surface of the flesh. This sense pleasure \nyields fleeting happiness, and shuts out the more subtle, more pure, and more lasting \nenjoyments of the silent taste of blessedness, and of the innumerable blissful \nperceptions which can be felt when, by deep meditation, the consciousness of the \nperson meditating is turned from the bodily surface enjoyment to the inner perception. \nWhen you are greedily eating, your soul s happiness is drowned in the muddy well of \ninsatiable greed on the soil of the palate. When you are listening to flattering words, \nyour soul s wisdom is sunk beneath the waters of falsehood. When you are addicted to \nsex-temptation, your soul s happiness of touching God in every speck of space, with \nendless exhilarating thrills of happiness, is substituted for the passing, misleading, \npeace-destroying, physical emotions. \nIt is not a sin to eat with self-control, or to live an upright, honest family life, but the \nspiritual aspirant should be ever watchful not to get into the small ruts of material \nhabits and sense pleasures, and entirely forget the vast, unending happiness of \nspiritual perceptions, felt in the Silence, and in the perceptions of the inner Centers. \nMental balance, and ever-increasing happiness, are lost when sense pleasures crowd \nout the soul happiness felt in Silence, but it is wonderful to enjoy the pure pleasures of \nthe senses with the joy of God, felt in meditation. They are fools who drown their \nsouls happiness in the cesspools of impure, enslaving pleasures of the senses. \nRemember, all the sense pleasures which you indulge in, in spite of the warnings of \nyour reason and conscience, are peace-destroying. All pure enjoyments of the senses, \nindulged in with self-control, produce Divine happiness. \nThe ordinary man wakes, bathes his body, enjoys the after-bath sensation, eats a hot \nbreakfast, hurries to work, begins to get weary, and becomes refreshed by lunch, then \nworks again, and goes home tired, worried, and cranky.

This means that the mind of Jesus, \nalthough it had reached the pinnacle of meditative intuition in His Christ state of \nconsciousness, was still subject to the temptation of ignorant delusion. His past \ndelusive habit of yielding to temptation, finding constant defeat in the sacred \nconsciousness of Jesus, was making a last effort to dislodge his Divine habit of right \nthinking and claim Him as its own. The memory of His past delusive habit cast a \ntempting thought in His mind, and He was led to think: \"Since I have regained my lost \nhigh state of Divine Sonhood by deep meditation, it is safe for me to cast myself down \ninto temptation, because God will protect me through my guardian angels of spiritual \nconviction, intuitive experiences, and meditation-born wisdom. Even if I fall into \ntemptation, the angels of spiritual thoughts will lift me up again to my high estate of \nconsciousness, and will prevent my strong foot of will power from dashing against the \nstone of misery-making spiritual error.\" \nThe better spiritual habit conquered, and Jesus replied by thought to temptation within \nHimself. The highest wisdom, as written in the great Scriptures, says: \"Attention must \nnot stray from God, the Father, the Creator of all forms of consciousness, but that \nconsciousness must remain identified with and concentrated upon God. It must not \nseparate itself from Him and try to drag Him matter-ward.\" \nAll craving and desire in man should be transmuted and turned toward God, instead of \nallowing it to try to delude the God in man. Temptation is a delusive, compelling, \nconflicting, joy-expecting thought which should be used to pursue happiness-making \ntruth and not misery-producing error. Although God is the creator of consciousness, \nstill the vitiated consciousness in man turns away from Him and tries to lure the soul \nto concentrate upon the temporary joy of the senses. When Jesus found this, He \nsnubbed His temptation, and told it not to be audacious enough to tempt the God in \nHim. \nAgain, the psychological temptation followed Jesus to His very high, mountain-like \nstate of Self-Realization, and in a quick mental vision showed Him all the power and \ntemporary glory that material possessions could give Him, and thus lured Him with \nthe thought: \"I will give you all this power and wealth.\" Further, His psychological \ndelusive habit made Him feel that it had complete power over all temporarily-glorified \nmaterial things, and that it had the power to give Him enjoyment of all material \nobjects if only He would fall from His high state of self-control and happiness in \nSpirit, down to the plane of sense enjoyment. \n"}

To eat only for \nthe pleasure of taste, produces greed, slavery, indigestion, and death. To eat for the \nmaintenance of the soul s body temple, produces self-control, long life, health, and \nhappiness. \n\"My senses were given to serve me,\" thought Jesus, \"and were not made for me to \ncater to their insatiable appetite.\" As a man cannot satisfy his hunger by feeding \nsomeone else, so also the soul cannot be happy by catering to the unnatural appetite of \nthe senses. \nWhen the Psychological Delusive Habit had finished tempting Jesus with memories of \npre-natal and post-natal material habits, the delusion of mortal habit departed, for a \ntime at least, giving rise to the feeling of victory of the good habit.

Of course, it must be \nremembered that the occult soldiers can easily rout the forces of restlessness when \nthey are reinforced by the soldiers of discrimination and before the throne of \nconsciousness is usurped by King Material Desire. \nIt is good to start meditation at an early age, or failing in that, to start meditation as \nsoon as the mental discriminative inclination is receptive.

M. N. Olmsted \nTHIS is the record of John, when the Jews sent Priests and Levites from Jerusalem to \nask him: \"Who art Thou?\" He confessed, and denied not; but confessed: \" I am not the \nChrist.\" \nAnd they asked him: \"What then? Art thou Elias?\" And he saith: \"I am not.\" \"Art thou \nthat prophet?\" And he answered: \"No.\" Then said they unto him: \"Who art thou, that \nwe may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?\" He said: \"I \nam the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Make straight the way of the Lord, as \nsaid the prophet Esaias. \nAnd they which were sent were of the Pharisees, and they asked him, and said unto \nhim: \"Why baptizeth thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that \nprophet?\" John answered them, saying: \"I baptize with water; but there standeth One \namong you whom ye know not; He it is who, coming after me, is preferred before me, \nwhose shoe s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.\" These things were done in \nBethabara beyond Jordan. where John was baptizing. \nAnd John bare record, saying: \"I saw the Spirit descending form heaven like a dove, \nand it abode upon Him. and I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, \nthe same said unto me: Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and \nremaining on Him, and same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.

Then Jesus turned and saw them following, and saith \nunto them: \"What seek ye?\" \nThe Priests and Levites, with only ordinary spiritual perceptions, were naturally \nskeptical about the qualities of a Christ. Wise men, meeting a Christ-like man, would \nnot ask him if he were Christ, because the wise, by their own wisdom, can recognize \nthe qualities of a Christ-like man. It was the ignorant priests who asked John if he \nwere the expected Christ. \nHuman consciousness is circumscribed by the circumference of the body, but Christ \nConsciousness is unlimited, stretched over the entire tract of Eternity. Many people \nignorantly worship the body of Jesus, and forget to recognize the consciousness of the \nChrist which could encompass the entire Cosmos with all the island universes, just as \na cup can take up all the soup in a vessel. \nJohn, being a good saint, in spite of his greatness, could not see that he had expressed \nChrist Consciousness in his consciousness. If souls can be made in the image of \ntranscendental God, the Father, they are automatically also made after the pattern of \nthe Christ Consciousness present in all Creation. My contention is that everyone is a \npotential Christ, and all those who can make their concentration deep enough and \nbroad enough can receive Christ within their own consciousness. John was a potential \nChrist, still, due to his identification with ignorance, he could not feel that in essence \nhe had reached the state of Christ Consciousness. Therefore, John spoke the truth and \nconfessed that the potential Christ in him had not yet manifested in his outward \nhuman consciousness. That is why John confessed: \"I am not the Christ.\" \nJohn also denied that he was Elias, because, (as told before) he could not remember \nhis previous incarnation as Elias. John, as Elias, was the Guru (preceptor) of Jesus. \nTeachers are many, but there can be but one Guru. He is the vehicle which God uses \nto bring a prodigal son back to His mansion of freedom. Elias had been spiritually \nadvanced in the earlier incarnation, but had somewhat fallen from his high \nconsciousness during his incarnation as John. It was Jesus, John s disciple, who had \nadvanced so greatly that he was able to remind his Guru of his forgotten incarnation. \nBesides, John was humble because he had fallen somewhat spiritually, and he did not \nwant to identify himself with the high state of his previous incarnation as Elias. He \nsaid: \"I am not Elias;\" i.e., I am not as highly developed in this incarnation as I was \nwhen Elias. He gave an evasive answer when he was asked; \"Who art Thou, that we \nmay give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest Thou of Thyself?\" He said: \"I \nam the voice of one crying in the wilderness; make straight the way of the Lord, as \nsaith the prophet Esaias.\" \n"}

The \n\"wilderness\" signifies the consciousness of a saint where no green herbs of fresh \nmaterial desires can grow. The saint makes his soul barren so that God may come in \nwithout resistance from the weeds and brambles of material desires. And as John \nheard the all-knowing cosmic Sound within him, in the Wilderness of Silence, he \nheard the intuitive wisdom command him silently: \"Make straight the way of the \nLord.\" Manifest the Lord, or the subjective Christ Consciousness in all Cosmic \nvibratory Creation, through the awakened intuitive feeling of a straight spine during \nthe state of meditation. \nThough John denied that he was as developed as Elias, still he spoke of his inner \nspiritual state as having attained the knowledge of expanding Omnipresent Cosmic \nVibration. He also made it plain that he not only knew he had sustained the Cosmic \nVibratory state, but that he was meditating with a straight spine, and trying to open up \nthe spinal centers, so that the locked-out Christ Consciousness could descend into his \nbody. The word \"straight\" signifies also following the straight path of Truth, through \nwhich alone the soul can reach God. \nJohn told the priests in all spiritual subtleness that he was neither the body of Jesus \nnor Elias, but that he was the Omnipresent, Cosmic Vibration trying to feel Christ \nConsciousness in his body. \nJohn also hinted to the ignorant mass of people that the only way by which a \nmetaphysical, Omnipresent Christ Consciousness could be received is by means of a \nstraight spine with awakened centers of consciousness. \nThe populace was looking for Christ in a physical body, so John subtly told how he \nwas welcoming Christ through a straight spine, and said that anyone who wanted to \nknow Christ must receive Him in meditation with a straight spine, and must follow the \nstraight path of Truth. \nOf course, the physical interpretation is that John cut down the bushes of peoples \nignorance, and created a straight path of Truth so that others might follow that path to \nreceive the teachings of Jesus in attaining Christ Consciousness. \nJohn was also explaining that just worshipping the body of Jesus was not the right \nway to know Him. The Christ Consciousness embodied could be felt only in the \nAstrally-awakened straight spine. John was educating the people in order that they \nmight know the straight way by which the metaphysical Christ Consciousness in the \nbody of Jesus could be understood and intuitionally perceived. \n"}

The flow of Life Force through the spine and nerves causes man to \nperceive and appreciate sense objects only, but when the searchlights of the senses are \nreversed and thrown back on the Spirit through the awakened spine, then Christ \nConsciousness is revealed. \nAll the Yogis (those who seek scientific union with God) of India lay the utmost \nimportance on keeping the spine straight during meditation, and upon concentration \non the point between the eyebrows. The idea is that when the attention is switched off \nfrom the senses it begins to withdraw the currents from the sense telephones, and to \nreverse them towards the Spiritual Eye, situated between the two physical eyes, and \nthe medulla. \nThe Spiritual Eye is a reflection of the medulla. As one switch throws light into the \ntwo lights of an automobile, so the medulla throws the current into the two physical \neyes, but by making the eye single; i.e., concentrating on the point between the two \neyes, one can see the medually reflected as only one light. \nThe Pineal Eye and the Medulla Eye are one and the same, reflected through the two \nouter eyes. By making the eyes single again, the diffused light of the two physical \neyes is seen as one Spiritual Eye. Jesus said: \"If, therefore, thine eye be single, thy \nwhole body shall be full of light.\" \nAttention is the conductor of our life currents and consciousness. Those who greedily \nindulge too much in the pleasures of the senses of touch, smell, taste, sound, and sight \nfind the searchlights of their consciousness and Life Force turned outward towards \nmatter, but when, by self-control and meditation, the attention is focused on the point \nbetween the eyebrows in the spiritual sensorium, then the Life Force and \nconsciousness steadily begin to throw a revealing light over the Christ Consciousness \nOmnipresent in all finite Creation. \nEvery spiritual aspirant should know that a bent spine during meditation offers real \nresistance to the process of reversing the life currents. A bent spine throws the \nvertebra out of alignment and pinches the nerves, making it impossible for the Life \nForce to reverse its direction and flow through towards the Spiritual Eye and the \nmedulla. \nJohn, Esaias, and Yogis say that to receive Christ Consciousness from Jesus, or from a \nreal Yogi preceptor, more than a simple physical contact is necessary.

He was \nmore conscious of the body than of the Spirit, and so he thought: \"I have lots to \novercome in order to purify my body before I can baptize my Spirit.\" Since John s \nconcentration was on purifying the body first, he taught the way of baptizing with \nwater. It has been explained elsewhere that cleansing the body with water before a \nSpiritual Initiation is conducive to a receptive state of the mind, due to the calming \nand cooling effect of bathing. \nAfter the body is clean, the soul should be baptized by wisdom, magnetism, spiritual \nradiation, or Holy Ghost, (or holy, silent, ghost-like vibratory emanations from the \npreceptor). John knew that he could bring a temporary spiritual influence into the \nbody of his disciples, but that Jesus, with His Cosmic Aura, could baptize the souls of \npeople with wisdom, and with Cosmic Vibratory Emanations. \nJohn speaks of Jesus as the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world. A \nlamb is the symbol of innocence, humility, and loyalty. Jesus was innocent, pure, \nhumble, and true to God in every way. His was not the arrogance or power of a tyrant \ntrying to destroy evil. Evil never can be uprooted by evil. Murder can never be \nabolished by murder. Unless the desire to murder is torn from the heart, it will leave \nits roots in the hearts of men and go on growing. Evil can only be destroyed by good. \nMurderers should not be hanged, but should be reformed with wisdom. The thought of \nmurder must be banished from all hearts before killing will leave the shores of this \nearth. \nIf God, powerful as He is, punished man by physical means, man could not live on \nearth and exercise his independence of judgment and thus learn by his own mistakes. \nTherefore, God uses love, and like a lamb lets Himself be butchered so that some day, \nby the example of the humble resignation of the lamb to the butcher, He may awaken \nthe higher sympathy and kindness in man. \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 127, "text": "Therefore, Jesus came as the lamb of spirituality, humble, loyal to God, ready to offer \nHimself as a sacrifice before the Temple of Truth, so that by His supreme example of \npurity, humbleness, and meekness He might act as the greatest spiritual light to drive \naway the dark sins of the world. Darkness cannot be chased away by darkness. Sin \ncannot be dispelled by sin. Lying cannot be stopped by lying. Murder cannot be \nstopped by hanging. Revengefulness cannot be stopped by revengefulness. \nDarkness can be dispelled only by light. Sin can be dispelled by righteousness. Lying \ncan be stopped by examples of truthfulness. Murder will cease by example of \nforgiveness and love, for the murderer s desire to commit murder can only be healed \nby forgiveness. Revengefulness can cease only by forgiveness. Jesus, Son of God, by \nHis unique example of grand, humble, Almighty Godliness, has become the light of \nages to show people the way out of darkness for all time. \nJohn predicted that Jesus would come after him, destined by God to work out His plan \nof showing people the path of redemption. John at first did not know that Jesus had \ncome, so he continued to baptize with water in the way that he knew best how to do \ngood to mankind. \nJohn spoke of The Christ Consciousness, immanent in all vibratory Cosmic energy, as \nsymbolized in the dove-like Spiritual Eye, the star-marked opal-blue light encased in a \nring of golden ray. This light is symbolized by a dove because it brings perennial \npeace. The star represents the mouth of the dove and is the secret passage to Cosmic \nConsciousness. The blue and golden lights are the two wings of the dove. The blue \nrepresents the Cosmic tunnel leading to the perception of the subjective Christ \nIntelligence in all Creation. The ring of light represents the objective Cosmic energy, \nCosmic Vibration, or the Holy Ghost. \nThe Spiritual Eye is composed of the life-tron (like electron) or the finest ultimate unit \nof intelligence and energy. It is finer than electrons, of which all matter and \nconsciousness are composed. Each microcosmic lifetron contains in miniature the \nessence of all the macrocosmic creation. The Cosmos is made of the transcendental \nGod, the Father, the consciousness beyond all Creation; and God, the Son, (the \nconsciousness of the Father reflected in the womb of Cosmic Energy as the Only \nBegotten, only reflected Christ Consciousness) and the Holy Ghost, or Cosmic \nVibration. This Cosmic Vibration appears as the Cosmic Sound of all lifetrons and \nCosmic Energy. \nMicrocosmically each lifetron, or the Spiritual Eye in man, is composed of the \nelements God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or of transcendental Cosmic \nConsciousness, of Christ Consciousness, and of Cosmic Energy.

Simply seeing the light, or showing others the light \nof the Spiritual Eye, is not enough (as advanced students of Yogoda Kriya, the \nHighest Art of Realization, can). One must be able to perceive the Spirit through the \nSpiritual Eye. This is what is meant by the Spirit remaining on Om.

It is very encouraging to know that the same Truth is given in both of the \nforemost Scriptures of India. \nPatanjali was one of the greatest of Hindu Yogis and his Sutras describe the scientific \ntechnique of uniting the individualized soul with undifferentiated Spirit. The Yoga \nSutras of Patanjali were compiled after the birth of Christ, but the Bhagavad Gita was \ngiven to the world long before the birth of Christ. It was Patanjali who understood that \nthe Bhagavad Gita was the \"Song Celestial,\" by which the Lord wanted to unite the \nsouls of his ignorant and wandering children with His own Spirit. This was to be \naccomplished scientifically through spiritual law. Patanjali explains this very clearly \nin definite metaphysical terms, while the Gita gives it in allegory. \nThese metaphysical soldiers, mentioned above, must come to the aid of the devotee \nwho wants to battle the evil soldiers of the senses. King Desire, Durjudhana) tells his \npreceptor, Drona, (past habit) about the spiritual, occult soldiers who were lined up in \nbattle array in the spinal plexuses. \nAlmost every soul is a prisoner of the senses, which are entrenched on the surface of \nthe body. The soul s attention is lured away from its inner kingdom in the medulla, \nthe Spiritual Eye, and the plexuses, to the outer region of the body, where greed, \ntemptation, and attachment have their strongholds. The devotee, who wants to lead \nKing Soul away from the misery-making slums of the senses, finds that he cannot do \nso without a severe clash between the soldiers of the senses and the Divine soldiers of \nthe soul. \nThe fourth, fifth, and sixth stanzas of the Bhagavad Gita describe the metaphysical \nsoldiers of the soul which are roused by meditation. The fifth, sixth, and seventh \nstanzas describe the soldiers of the senses which become excited and try to hold back \nthe awakened soul and to resist his occult armies which struggle to rescue him. \nThe man rolling down hill finds no resistance, but as soon as he wants to climb up he \nmeets great resistance, so it is with the man who is fast sliding into evil. He does not \nfind resistance until he tries to reverse his direction and climb up the hill of virtue. \nThe man who wakes up and tries to become better finds his evil habits clashing with \nhis desire for self-control. If the soul wins the first psychological battle through self-\ncontrol, it finds that it has to go through another and more subtle metaphysical battle \nbetween the faculties of Self Realization and its own pre-natal and post-natal evil \nhabits.  \nThe first stanza of the Gita describes the initial psychological clash between \ndiscrimination and sense habits, through which every spiritual novice has to struggle. \n"}

M. N. Olmsted. \nInterpretation \nAndrew, after staying with Jesus for a day, was so saturated with His spiritual \nmagnetism that he understood who Jesus was. After a short acquaintance with Jesus, \nAndrew became filled with the vibration of Jesus, the Christ. Christ Consciousness \ncannot be intellectually inferred, but has to come through intuitional awareness. There \nis a difference between Jesus, the son of man, and Jesus, the Son of God. \nSignificance of Christ Vibration \nThe Cosmic Energy and Cosmic Consciousness enter the medulla oblongata as \npositive and negative currents, forming a series of attracting magnets. Each individual \nis a bundle of these magnets and attracts others according to their strength. Jesus was \n"}

The optical magnet can charm, enthrall, \nand draw people so strongly that they may feel the magnetism of one s soul through \nthe eyes. Some highly developed people are able to spiritualize or heal a whole \naudience just by the magnetism of the eyes. \nThe laying of the hands on sick people is done to send the healing X-Rays of the \nhands into the body of the patient to electrocute the disease germs. There is no power \ngreater than the Life Force flowing through the hands, provided it is made strong by \nan indomitable will. Man s strong will, which refuses to be discouraged by anything \nand which flows continually and energetically toward the accomplishment of an \nobject, becomes divinely empowered. The strong will of man is Divine will. \nHow to Know Each Other \nThe best way to know an individual is to reside with him in the same house. Two \npeople living in the same room, even if they did not talk, would attract each other with \ntheir consciousness, nature, vitality, and so forth. Each would feel the silent emanation \nof the other s thought, Life Force, and the range and strength of his vital magnetism. \nEach man carries a tell-tale silent evidence of his own vibrations with him. All \nunbiased, spiritually sensitive souls, can know people simply by looking into their \neyes, or by merely coming in close contact with them and feeling their emanating \nvibrations. Worried, calm, timid, brave, cruel, wise, or godly people can be felt \ninstantly even by people with little spiritual perception. \nPeople with ordinary perception can feel others only when within close range of their \nmagnetism. Great minds, however, can feel one another from a distance, although \nperception is stronger if they have been closely associated for a while. Thus it was that \nAndrew s great soul, after remaining with Jesus for a day, felt His Christ magnetism \nand he was able to say to his brother Simon: \"We have found the Messias.\" \nWho is Christ? \nWe find Christ defined in the bible as \"The first begotten of the dead, and the prince \nof the kings of the earth.\" Rev. I:5. \n"}

With the change \nof the physical body, called \"death,\" the soul remains encased in the astral and \nideational bodies and is still unable to loosen its Life Wave to join the ocean of Spirit. \nIt is possible by higher meditation for the soul to free itself from the physical and \nastral worlds and then to merge itself in the ocean of Christ Consciousness. \nThat is why, in the above passage, it is stated that this Christ Consciousness can be \nexperienced only by those souls who have seen the complete death or dissolution of \ntheir encasing physical, astral, and the ideational bodies, and not by all who are \nmerely physically dead. \nIn the human consciousness, the soul experiences itself as identified with the physical \nbody, name, titles, possessions, nationality, and so forth.

For that reason, on the eve of a psychological battle, when the soul \nand its metaphysical soldiers became awakened and try to reclaim the lost, the Past \nTendency is especially liable to side with the evil soldiers of the senses. That is why \nwe hear King Material Desire speaking of Preceptor Past Tendency as fighting for \nhim. \nStill, King Material Desire knows that Preceptor Past Tendency was also the tutor of \nthe following metaphysical soldiers: \nOne, devotion; 2, vital celibacy; 3, spiritual memory; 4, Samadhi (Oneness); 5, \ndiscriminative intelligence; 6, extreme dispassion; 7, power to resist evil, or negative \ngood power; 8, power to follow positive rules or positive good power; 9, proper \nbodily posture, helpful in mind control; 10, inwardly controlled Life-Force reversed \ntoward God; 11, faculty of withdrawing consciousness from the senses. (Dhyana, or \nmeditation.) \nTherefore, King Material Desire wishes the evil Past Habit Tendency to know first \nabout the error-resisting opposing metaphysical soldiers, their principalities, and their \nstrength. This was done to show Evil Habit the strength of Good Habit, and how Evil \nHabit could be overpowered. \nAfter doing this, King Material Desire tells his Preceptor Past Evil Habit about the \nfollowing sense soldiers: \nOne, delusion; 2, only seeking Ego; 3, attachment; 4, repulsion; 5, flesh infatuation; 6, \nKarma, action; 7, past evil tendency; 8, desire, and so forth \nKing Material Desire is afraid that the metaphysical soldiers and the Preceptor Good \nHabit Tendency will be able to defeat the sense soldiers plus the preceptor of the bad \nhabit tendencies. \nEvil Habit Tendency, along with King Material Desire and his soldiers, could not \npossibly rule the body without having a serious clash with good habit and its \nmetaphysical soldiers. \nStanzas IV, V, and VI in Chapter I of the Bhagavad Gita describe the metaphysical \nsoldiers which were arrayed against the sense soldiers mentioned in Stanzas VIII and \nIX.

The Ego consciousness in man is always ready to resist Samadhi, or the \nconsciousness of Oneness with God. \nThe Ego and the Soul \nThe Ego consciousness in man tries to keep the soul attached to matter in the form of \nindividual traits and mortal desires born out of them. The Soul, being a reflection of \nthe Omnipresent Spirit, ought to reflect its omnipresent, all-knowing character. It is \nthe pure, perfect reflection of the Spirit, but when it forgets its own real nature and \nbecomes identified with the body and its attachments, it loses its consciousness of \nOmnipresence and becomes conscious only of the limitations of the body. This body-\nbound soul is called Ego. The soul in the Ego state is a prisoner of the flesh and its \nlimitations. \nThe soul, through meditation, can reach the state of Samadhi and thus can do away \nwith its Ego or matter consciousness. Reaching Samadhi, or Oneness with God, is the \nonly method by which the Ego consciousness can be completely defeated. \nSamadhi is the great general of the metaphysical army which leads the soldiers of \ndevotion, vital celibacy, spiritual memory, discriminative intelligence, extreme \ndispassion, negative good power, positive good power, proper bodily posture, \nreversed Life-Force, and withdrawn consciousness from the senses to battle the \nsoldiers of Ego, Bhisura, or King Material Desire. \nThere are different stages in the realization of Oneness. There is the realization of \nOneness of the Ego and the soul, and that of Oneness of the Soul and Spirit. There are \nreally three kinds of Samadhi: Jara, or unconscious trance; Swabikalpa, or perception \nof Spirit without the Waves of Creation; and the third and highest state is that of \nperception of the Ocean of Spirit with the Waves of Creation. \nThe unconscious state is useless for the most part because it is produced by a physical \ncontrol, or by the mental anaesthetic of keeping the mind blank. In this state a sense-\nbound soul can only be kept from increasing its attachments. It can never acquire \nwisdom or roast the seeds of pre-natal or post-natal bad habits. In this state, the mind \nis unconscious within and without. \nIt is related in the Hindu Scriptures that a wicked snake charmer went into a trance \nand fell into a well. The well dried up and became full of dirt and the man remained \nburied there for a hundred years with his body perfectly preserved in a state of \nsuspended animation. At the end of a hundred years some people who were digging \nout the old well found him and revived him by the application of hot water.

His hundred years of \nunconscious trance had not roasted the seeds of bad thought habits or cured him of his \nwickedness. \nIn the Swabikalpa Samadhi state the attention and the Life-Force are switched off \nfrom the senses and are kept consciously identified with the ever-joyous, ever-wise \nSpirit. In this state, the soul is released from the Ego consciousness and becomes \nconscious of Spirit beyond Creation. By repetition of this state of Samadhi, the soul \nabsorbs the fire of Spirit Wisdom, which roasts out the seeds of mortal desires. In this \nstate, the soul, as the meditater, its meditation on the Spirit, and the Spirit as the object \nof meditation, become one. The Wave of Soul meditating in the Ocean of Spirit \nbecomes merged with the Spirit. It does not lose its identity, but only expands into \nSpirit. In this state, the mind is conscious of the Spirit within only. It is not conscious \nof Creation without. \nIn the most advanced, or Nirbikalpa Samadhi state, the soul does not expand itself into \nthe big Spirit, but realizes itself and Spirit as existing together. This is the highest and \nmost enjoyable state in which the Ego consciousness, the soul consciousness, and the \nOcean of Spirit are seen all existing together. It is the state of watching the Ocean of \nSpirit and the Waves of Creation at the same time. In this state, the individual does not \nsee himself any longer as John Smith related to his body and his outer environment, \nbut he sees that the Ocean of Spirit has become not only the Wave of John Smith, but \nalso all the waves of all lives and of all things. In this state, the soul is conscious \nsimultaneously of Spirit within and of all Creation without. \nThe Swabikalph Samadhi and Nirbikalpa Samadhi states are described int he \nfollowing ancient Hindu song: \n\"In the Swabikalpa Samadhi Yoga (union) \nYou will drown (melt) yourself (Ego) in yourself (Spirit). \nIn the Nirbikalpa Samadhi Yoga \nYou will find (see) yourself (Ego) in yourself (in Spirit).\" \nThe Ego consciousness tries to keep the body under its control by reminding it of the \nlimited physical relations of country, race, nation, family, possessions, characteristics, \nand so forth. The soul is held to the body by the Ego consciousness. Struggling of the \nstate of Samadhi through meditation is the way to overcome the Ego consciousness. In \nthe highest Nirbikalpa Samadhi state the soul unites its Ego consciousness of race, \ncountry, family, body, possessions, and characteristics with the omnipresent, \n"}

THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST \n\"They came and saw where He (Jesus) dwelt and abode with Him that day; for it was \nabout the tenth hour. One of the two which heard John speak and followed him, was \nAndrew, Simon Peter s brother. He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto \nhim: We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. And he \nbrought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, He said: Thou art Simon, the son \nof Jona. \" \nIt is important to note the difference between Jesus the man and Jesus the Christ. Jesus \nwas the name of the man. The Sanskrit origin of this name is found in the word \"Isa,\" \nor, Lord of Creation. Mispronounced by travelers in many lands, and being used in \nmany different languages, the word Jesus came to be used in place of Isa. The Spanish \npronounce it \"Hazus.\" \nDifferent people, with voices influenced by different climates, pronounce the same \nwords differently and give birth to different languages with different spellings. The \nword \"Calcutta\" is spelled differently by different races. The English spell and \npronounce it \"Calcutta.\" The Bengalees pronounce it and spell it \"Kalicata.\" The \nWestern Hindus pronounce and spell it \"Kalicutta.\" Some Norwegians pronounce and \nspell the same word as \"Colquita.\" This illustrates how the name \"Isa\" could be \nchanged through the ages into \"Jesus.\" \nOriginally names expressed a quality of an individual. Then they were handed down \nfrom father to son for generations. This complicated matters and later each individual \nhad to have the name of his family, and also a name signifying his individuality. This \nmay be illustrated by my own name, which is a combination of Yoga and Ananda. \nYoga means scientific union, and Ananda means Bliss. The distinctive quality is the \nlove of scientific union of the soul with God. For that reason, the name of Yoga was \n"}

Ananda corresponds to a family name, but in this case it belongs \nto the order of Swamis and means those men who seek Divine Bliss. \nJesus, the Christ, likewise has meaning. Jesus was the name given by the family \nsignifying a Divine child, or lord of Creation, and the name Christ was given later and \nsignified the Christ consciousness which was manifest in the body of Jesus. Strangely \nenough, the family of Jesus, seeing the miraculous signs which attended His birth, \nnamed him \"Lord of Creation\" or \"Isa,\" and later, due to changes in pronunciation, \ncalled Him \"Jesus.\" \nThe Sanskrit name \"Kutastha Chaitanya,\" or Christ Consciousness, and the name of \none of the greatest prophets of India, Christna, who lived about 1500B.C., show that \nthe word Christ is a very ancient word, meaning the unchangeable consciousness \npresent in every atom of matter and in every speck of finite Creation. The Hindu \nprophet was called Jadaya, the Christna. Jadava was the family name, Christna the \nspiritual name. Jesus, the Christ, signifies that the body of Jesus was the vehicle in \nwhich the Christ Consciousness, or universal intelligence present in everything, was \nmanifest. \nPeople, through different ages, have sought the Messiah, or the christ, who could turn \ntheir attention from the soul s consciousness of little portions of the matter-world, \nsuch as country, society, and family, to the Omnipresence of Christ Consciousness. \nThroughout the ages, when the souls of people, instead of being identified with Christ \nConsciousness, became entangled in individual, family, social, and national \nconsciousness, they became limited, producing many miseries. Blind attachment of \nfamily property, and so on, leads to selfishness, quarrelsomeness, delusion of \npermanent possession, inharmony, worries, and the like. So-called blind patriotism \nproduces commercial greed, desire of wresting the possessions of others from them, \nand terrible wars. \nAfter souls suffer by repeatedly passing through family, social, and national troubles \nin different incarnations, they automatically desire to be released from misery and \nlong to find emancipation through a Christ-like savior. The Bhagavad Gita says that \nself-liberated souls are used again and again as vehicles of God, and are sent on earth \nto express the Christ Consciousness in order to help release matter-entangled souls. \nGod never created Himself into a human being, subject to the weakness of flesh and \nmental limitations. If God manufactured Jesus Christ as His Son, already complete \nand perfect, then the temptations of Jesus, by Satan, and His victory, were nothing but \nDivine Acting. Christ, who was already above death and temptations, could not have \nneeded any mental strength to overcome them. Hence, Jesus, as a perfect Son of God, \ncould not be an example for us. \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 144, "text": "Jesus was a liberated soul, one of the greatest that ever came on earth. He had \nstruggled through many incarnations in order to come to that Christ State, and it was \nduring the Christ State, in which He could feel His consciousness in every atomic cell \nof His great body of all matter, that He could act as a Savior of mankind. It is only in \nthis State that any Soul is able to feel Its perfect identity with God. Jesus, Himself, \nsaid that all those who received Him, (i.e., were mentally advanced enough and \nspiritually transparent enough) to them He gave the power to be the Sons of God. In \nthe words of Andrew we first find the differentiation between Jesus and Christ. \n\"And when Jesus behold him (Simon Peter) He said: Thou art Simon, the son of \nJona: thou shalt be called Caphas, which is, by interpretation\nA Stone. \" \nJesus saw Simon Peter and predicted that his spiritual life would be strong as a stone. \n\"The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith \nunto him: Follow Me. \" \nWhen great Masters, like Jesus, come on earth, they bring with them their advanced \ndisciples, in order to give them the higher teaching, and to test their spirituality on the \npsychological battlefield of the earth. So, Jesus, knowing His previous Guru, \n(preceptor), and disciple relationship with Philip, calmly said: \"Follow Me.\" This was \na command to Philip, for Jesus recognized His spiritual responsibility as a preceptor \ntoward Philip as His disciple. Jesus indicated that Philip should tune in his instinct-\nguided reason and will power with the higher wisdom-guided reason and will power \nof Jesus because that was the only way Philip could free himself from mortal delusion \nand overcome the compelling temptation of flesh. \nDelusion and pre-natal bad habits may completely overpower the reason and will \npower of a disciple during crucial tests when the delusive dictates of his own reason \nseem to him to be virtuous and true. In this state the disciple should never trust to his \nown decisions, about new undertakings of his life. Vice wears the cloak of virtuous \nreason to lure him away from the spiritual path. At that time the foresight of the \npreceptor should be consulted and his advice should be followed obediently by the \ndisciple, even though his own befogged reason may rebel and tell him to do otherwise. \nIn the delusive state the best undertakings may end in a disaster, for Satan, the \nUniversal Metaphysical Tempter, tries by every means to take the virtuous man from \nthe spiritual path. \n\"Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip findeth Nathaniel, \nand saith unto him: We have found Him, of whom Moses in the law and the prophets \ndid write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. And Nathaniel saith unto him: Can \nthere any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him: Come and see. \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 145, "text": "Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and saith unto him: Behold an Israelite indeed, in \nwhom there is no guile. \" \nPhilip quotes the intuitive revelations of Moses and the prophets, about the coming of \nJesus, the Christ. This raises the question: \"Are the happenings on this earth and \nearthly human affairs all predestined?\" We do not think so, but if not, how could \nMoses and the prophets foretell the coming of Christ? We think it was this way: \nMoses, by his intuitive foresight was able to trace the law of cause and effect which \ngoverns human life. He knew also of the law of God which sends self-emancipated, \nChrist-like souls onto the earth at different ages, when the people of the earth become \nburdened with sin. God uses the vehicles of Christ-like souls to inspire sorrow-laden \nmortal beings with the courage to seek salvation. \nNathaniel was a plain-spoken, sincere man, and he knew the sin-laden state of \nNazareth, and naturally he expressed doubt that such a place could ever produce a \nSavior. Philip was practical, and without argument tried to bring Nathaniel into the \ntransmuting personal magnetism of Jesus Christ. Philip knew that Christ, by His very \nlook and His magnetic life-force could electrocute the seeds of bad habits and doubts \nthat had formed grooves in the brain of Nathaniel. Jesus gave Nathaniel a soul-\npenetrating look which scorched out his ignorance and took an intuitive photograph of \nhis life. That is why Jesus said: \"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no \nguile.\" Behold a soul which is free from satanic insincerity. \n\"Nathaniel saith unto him: Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and saith unto \nhim: Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. \" \nNathaniel was astonished to hear Jesus analyze him so correctly and he wanted to \nknow how it was done. So Jesus said: \"Before Philip called thee, I saw thee.\" This \nseeing was not by the superficial eye, but it was the intuitive photograph of the soul \ntaken on the sensitive perception of Jesus, who was Omniscient and versed in the art \nof telepathy. \nOmnipresent God would never been born on earth as a human being, for God in His \ngreatness could never completely identify Himself with the limitations of temptation, \nmortality, and so forth, of a human existence. Unless God could forget Himself in a \nhuman incarnation, He could never in reality struggle with the limitations of human \nnature and make Himself a spiritual example to us. \nIf Jesus was already God, and came as God, His trials and sorrows, struggles, victory \nover Satan and crucifixion, were but Divine acting. In that case, Jesus acted out the \npre-ordained Divine part of His life without being touched by it, just as an actor plays \na part on the stage without being inwardly identified with it.

It is only when he tires to climb out of the \nsubterranean pit that he finds resistance from evil desires and habits. \nThe above ideal warns the spiritual aspirant that, as soon as he tries to change the \ncourse of his life from evil to good, he will find the awakening of material desires and \nan army of pre-natal and post-natal bad habits ready to give battle to his sacred \nresolutions and holy actions instituted to find emancipation from earth bondage. \nMaterial desires are gathered by the soul through incarnations, from the time it leaves \nthe abode of Spirit. Mundane desires are born of material habits. Pre-natal material \nhabits appear as worldly instincts, and after birth, material habits appear as strong \ntendencies. King Material Desire describes these matter-bent tendencies as great \npsychological heroes skilled in the use of various psychological weapons. \nWhenever the spiritual aspirant becomes inwardly awake, he finds that his \nconsciousness becomes the battleground where the mental warriors of bad tendencies, \nwith their weapons of temptations, rally to fight the forces of good habits and \ndiscrimination armed with the weapons of wisdom. \nMost people who are meek prisoners of bad habits do not encounter any resistance, or \nbattle with the various weapons of lure used by bad material tendencies.

He met a saint and took the vow to abstain from drinking. He asked his \nservants to hide his costly wine in locked boxes and to keep the key, and instructed \nthem to serve the liquor to his friends only. Everything went along all right with Mr. J. \nfor some time because of his joy in the power of a new resolution against drink. For a \nwhile he did not feel the unseen gripping lure of the liquor-tempting habit. \nAs time went on, and he felt himself proof against liquor temptation, he asked his \nservants to leave the key of the wine room with him so that he could serve the red \nliquid to his friends himself. Feeling further mental security, he thought it was too \nmuch bother to go to the cellar to get liquor for his friends, so he kept some wine \nbottles hidden in the parlor. After a few days, Mr. J thought: \"Since I am proof against \nliquor, let me look at the sparkling red wine in the bottle on the table.\" \nEvery day he looked at the bottle. Then he thought: \"Since I am absolutely proof \nagainst temptation, I may just as well smell it.\" This went on for a few days. Then he \nthought: \"Since I no longer care for liquor, I will take a mouthful of wine, taste it, and \nthen spill it out.\" He did this. Then he thought: \"Since I am so strong and am proof \nagainst liquor, there will be no harm if I drink once and swallow a little.\" After that, \nhe thought: \"Since I have conquered the liquor habit, let me take only one gulp of \nwine at a time, as many times as my unenslaved will desires.\" Then he found that he \ngot drunk and kept on being helplessly drunk every day in spite of his will, just as he \nhad before. \nThe above illustration shows how: \n1. The liquor drinking habit was put down temporarily by the strong resolution to \nconquer. \n2. It shows how Mr. J. failed to realize that his resolution against liquor had not had \nenough time to ripen into a good habit.

The \nlatter causes the former and is more dangerous. \n3.

Therefore, Nathaniel, feeling the consciousness of Jesus transferred within \nhimself, felt himself divinely transmuted and acknowledged Jesus as the Son of God \nand the King of Israel. The first title is the Divine Title and is of tremendous \nsignificance. \nNathaniel spoke of Jesus as the son of God and owner of the universe and, being such, \nhe was also the greatest power (King) in Israel, which lay somewhere on this little pill \nof earth situated in God s Kingdom of the universe. \nJesus answered and said: \"Because I said unto Thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, \nbelievest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.\" Jesus was pleased to find \nNathaniel respond to His spiritual vibrations. Nathaniel s belief in the words of Jesus \nwas the result of the vibratory experience which Nathaniel received from Jesus. \nMany people do not believe even after they feel a truth, so Jesus said unto Nathaniel: \n\"As you believe in Me, just receiving My vibrations, you will see greater things, \n(greater miracles) than these, i.e., than these miracles of My sending to you astral and \nthought vibrations.\" \nAnd He said unto him: \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, hereafter ye shall see heaven \nopen and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.\"  \nSpiritual Interpretation: \nVerily, I say unto you: Afterwards you shall see the astral region through the opening \nof the telescopic Spiritual Eye and you shall see the luminous astral bodies ascending \nout of the dead physical bodies into the Astral Kingdom.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 155, "text": "In this Stanza the two important opposing generals of the forces of good and evil are \nBhima and Bhisma. It is found that Bhima, the Soul-guided vital force and breath-\ncontrol, leads to Soul consciousness. For this reason, the Soul-guided vital force is \nspoken of as the greatest enemy of Bhisma, or the body-identified Ego.   \nHow Bhima, or Breathing Exercises, Help You to be Spiritual: \nBy proper breathing exercises, as taught in the classes of \"Highest Self Realization,\" \nthe venous blood is burned out and the body is electrified. When the body stops \ndecaying, the heart gets rest and learns to control the Life Force moving through the \nfive sense-telephones of touch, smell, taste, hearing, and sight. \nOf course, when the Life Force is shut off, the material sensations cannot reach the \nbrain to snatch the attention away from God and entangle it in the material world. \nThat is why Bhima, or proper breathing exercises, and the few strong soldiers of \nconcentration, intuition, inner perception, calmness, self-control, and so on, can be \nawakened to fight the forces of the Pseudo-Soul, or Ego. \nIt is the breathing exercises that are responsible for cutting off the nerve force through \nwhich the sense impulses reach the brain and invade attention with darts of material \ndesires. Therefore, Bhima, or Soul-guided Life Force, is the principal enemy of Ego, \nor Bhisma. \nRevelations About the Genesis of Ego Consciousness: \nOn the other hand, the purpose of Bhisma, or Ego, is to keep the Soul s attention \ncontinually busy with the living reports and countless enticing ways of sensations. \nThe Ego, or Pseudo-Soul, instead of throwing the searchlight of attention on God, \nkeeps it reflected on the senses. The Ego consciousness is the consciousness of Prince \nSoul in bondage in the slums of the body. Hence, it is the Ego, and the deluded \nfleshbound consciousness of the Soul, which is responsible for awakening all the \ncountless soldiers of temptations couched within the human body. \nWithout Ego consciousness, the entire army of evil and temptation vanishes like a \nquickly-forgotten dream. If the Soul dwelt in the body without being identified with it, \nas the Souls of saints do, then no temptations could keep it tied to the body, but the \ntrouble is, as the Soul descends into the body, it projects its individualized ever-\n"}

Essentially the Soul is ever pure. Ordinary mortals allow \ntheir Souls to live as flesh-entangled Egos and not as Spirit s reflection, or real Soul. \nA wealthy boy prince went into the slums and lived there so long that he thought he \nwas poor and miserable. He ascribed to himself all the troubles that go with poverty, \nbut when he was forcibly brought back to his palace and lived there for some time he \nrealized that he had never been poor except in his imagination. \nLikewise, when, by proper breathing exercises, the five sense-telephones are \ndisconnected, then Prince Soul s attention is automatically switched off from the Ego \nconsciousness and misery-making senses. Then the Soul, finding itself, says to itself: \n\"I was never anything but ever-new joyous Spirit, and I only imagined I was a mortal \nman subject to temptations.\" \nHowever, it is hard to realize that you are not a fleshly Being and that in reality you \nare neither a Hindu nor an American Temple, nor any of the other limited sense-\nbound things you appear to be.

And both Jesus was called, and His disciples to the marriage. And when \nthey wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto Him, They have no wine. Jesus \nsaith unto her: WOMAN WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH THEE? MINE HOUR IS \nNOT YET COME .\"  \nJesus addressed His mother as \"woman\" because He saw only the Divine Spirit as His \nreal mother and father, and His earthly mother as only a human being. \"Woman, I can \nhave nothing to do with thee, even though thou art my mother, until the right time \ncomes for me to be directed by the Divine Power to act, and to manifest His glory.\" \nJesus did not perform the miracle of turning the water into wine just to accommodate \nHis mother, or to show His Divine Powers, but He performed the miracle in obedience \nto God s direction. \nAt the proper time, before people who have the possibility of Spiritual awakening, \nmiracles are sometimes performed by Saints in order to bring people unto God. Saints \nusually prefer to draw people by the love of God and not by miracles. That is why \nthey seldom show their power. Miracles draw curiosity seekers, while the love of God \ndraws highly developed Souls. For that reason Jesus did not want to perform miracles \nuntil He was commanded by God to do so at the right time. \n\"His mother saith unto the servants: Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it. And there \nwas set there six water pots of stone, after the manner of purifying of the Jews, \ncontaining two or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them: FILL THE \nWATERPOTS WITH WATER .\"  \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 158, "text": "At Divine intuitional suggestions, Jesus asked the servants to fill the waterpots so that \nHe could declare the glory of God by changing the water into wine. Besides, He had \nthe pots filled with water before their eyes in order that they might see it and know \nthat it became wine through Divine Power and not through magic. \n\"And they filled them up to the brim. And He saith unto them: DRAW OUT NOW \nAND BEAR UNTO THE GOVERNOR OF THE FEAST. And they bare it. When \nthe Ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence \nit was, (but the servants which drew the water knew) the Governor of the feast called \nthe bridegroom, and saith unto him: Every man at the beginning doth set forth good \nwine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse; but thou has kept the \ngood wine until now. This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and \nmanifested forth His glory; and His disciples believed on Him.\"  \nThe above sentence distinctly shows that the miracle of Jesus was not meant for the \ngaze of curiosity seekers, but was meant to enhance the faith of the disciples in God s \npower over all things. \nWine and the human body are equally made of electrons. It is the different rate of \nvibration of these electrons that constitutes the endless variety of material forms. \nJesus, being omnipresent in God, knew the metaphysical relation of matter to Divine \nWill. He demonstrated that one form of matter could be changed into another form, \nnot only by chemical processes, but by the Universal Power of Mind. This miracle \ntestifies to the fact that all matter is controlled by the one unifying and balancing \npower of Divine Intelligence and Will. \nBy reacting to this Divine Intelligence, Jesus changed the arrangement of electrons \nand protons in the water and thus turned them into wine, which has a different specific \ngravity from water. The law of causation of all material forms can be traced to the \nactivity of electrons, but beyond that the sources of the law of cause and effect is lost. \nScientists do not know why electrons and protons rearrange themselves into different \nforms and create different kinds of matter. \nHerein lies room for a Divine Intelligence, says the scientist, inasmuch as it must be \nthat power which commands the subtle electronic and protonic bricks and directs them \nto arrange themselves in different combinations, thus creating different substances. \n\"After this He went down to Capernaum, He, and His mother, and His brethren, and \nHis disciples; and they continued there not many days. And the Jews Passover was at \nhand. And Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and found in the temple those that sold oxen \nand sheep, and doves, and the changers of money, sitting. And when He had made a \nscrorge of small cords, He drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the \n"}

It was not the little cord, but the personality, the \nDivine vibration and the colossal Spiritual force behind it, which frightened away the \nmoney changers. Great prophets, though they are internally free from anger, may use \nthe semblance of anger to admonish and correct those who respond more to fear and \nvibrations than to love vibrations. \nJesus, who tells you to love your enemies, shows by the above action that the Divine \nSaint also has power behind His meekness. No one dared to resist His Spiritual Power \nand determination, as was shown by the fact that a whole group of able-bodied money \nchangers fled before the power of a single meek man. \nJesus said that the House of God should be free from the contradictory vibrations of \nmaterial thoughts involved in buying and selling. He only meant that according to the \nlaws of concentration we should center our minds upon one thing at a time. While in \nthe house of God, we should concentrate upon Him, and there should be nothing there \nto awaken material thoughts. He meant that buying and selling should be carried on in \nthe market and not in the temple. \nThere is a spiritual lesson in the above act of Jesus. The temple of mind, during \nprayer, should not be a place where the thoughts of material gain persist. Many \npeople, during prayer, carry in the background of their minds the thought of buying \nand selling of material things and the profit thereof. Jesus says this is disastrous \nbecause it brings neither God nor prosperity. \nDuring meditation, as often as the money changers of material thoughts come to your \nmind, so often should you make a scourge of calmness, formed out of the gathered \nwill power acquired throughout life, and drive out the restless material thoughts from \nyour temple. \n \nThe Bhagavad Gita \nLocation of Various Powers In the Centers \nChapter I, Stanza 11 \n"}

Even Past Tendency can be killed by a \ngood, strong, new tendency, but it is very hard to kill the Ego consciousness, which \nmakes the Soul think of itself as a body weighing so many pounds, containing brittle \nbones, subject to poverty, sickness, and death, and many other limitations. \nThis Ego, which is conscious of being identified with a body, is carried in the heart of \nthe Soul through many incarnations. That is why King Material Desire is strong and \nstrives to protect the body consciousness by all means, for that consciousness, along \nwith the army of limitations, can keep the Soul a prisoner of matter. \nKing Material Desire thinks that even if Past Evil Tendency is destroyed, other evil \ntendencies may be created to keep the Soul in bondage, but King Material Desire is \nafraid that if the Ego consciousness is slain in the psychological battle during the \nspiritual skirmish of meditation, the Soul will remember its state of Cosmic \nConsciousness and will be able, with its power, to annihilate all the armies of delusion \n"}

The soldiers of King Material Desire occupy, \ntogether with he true forces of the Good, the coccygeal, sacral, and lumbar plexuses, \nplus the entire skin surface and the dugouts of the uncontrolled senses. \nAnother version of the above Stanza is that on one side are assembled  \n \n(1) the Spirit as Christ Consciousness (Krishna, of the Bhagavad Gita),  \n \n(2) the power of Samadhi (or intuitional Oneness with God) in the medulla and \nthe point between the two eyebrows, and \n \n(3) King Calmness (Yudhistira) centered in the cervical skiey plexus, as Divine \nDevotion, and  \n \n(4) Bhima, or Vital Breath and Power, in the dorsal breath center, and  \n \n(5) Arjuna, or Life Force, Patience, and Self Control, in the lumbar-fire center, \nand  \n \n(6) Nakulor, or power to follow good rules, in the sacral-water center, and  \n \n(7) Sabedeva, or power to follow prescribed rules, in the coccygeal or earth \ncenter. \nThen on the other side, the senses also are assembled in the coccygeal, sacral, lumbar, \ndorsal, cervical, and medulla centers as Bhisma, Drona, and Kripa (as Ego and its \ninclinations); Material Pride, or Shalya; Material Attachment, or Shakuni; as Greed \n(Karna and Bikarna); Anger (Duhshashan, hard to control) and Jayadratha, (fear of \ndeath) and King Material Desire, (Durjodhana) respectively. \n[The Sanskrit names are given for reference to the historical and psychological \nnames, for the convenience of Sanskrit scholars, but can be omitted by the average \nreader if found confusing.]     \n"}

And when he had made a \nscourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the Temple, and the sheep and the \noxen; and poured out the changers money, and overthrew the tables; and said unto \nthem that sold doves: TAKE THESE THINGS HENCE: MAKE NOT MY \nFATHER S HOUSE AN HOUSE OF MERCHANDISE. And His disciples \nremembered that it was written: The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. \" (\"Walks \nand Words of Jesus,\" by Rev. M. N. Olmsted.) \nIn the foregoing passages, it looks as if such a great Son of God, as Jesus, should not \nhave become angry and made a scourge of cords with which to hit the money-\nchangers. In this action of Jesus it looks as if He contradicted His own saying: \"But I \nsay unto you, that ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, \nturn to him the other also.\"\nMatt., 5:39. \nJesus used the cord more or less to scare these grown-up ignorant children of God \n(His brethren) and to send them away so that they could not desecrate the House of \nGod. He meant that merchandise in the House of Prayer was a distraction, just as an \naltar and preaching in the shop would be a distraction. Jesus, in this act, tried to show \npeople that they should concentrate on one thing at a time. In the house of business \nthey should think of selling articles. In the House of God they should think of Him. \nBesides, Jesus, with his little cord, didn t hurt anyone, nor was He actually angry \ninternally. He put on a show of anger to frighten the big, naughty children who were \ntrading in God s House. If Jesus had been really angry, He would have used His \nDivine powers to destroy these desecrators of God s Temple. \nThis is well illustrated by an old Hindu story. Once upon a time, long, long ago, a \nvenomous, vicious serpent used to live in a hole in the hill on the outskirts of a \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 163, "text": "village. A hermit of great miraculous power also made his home in this village. Many \nof the villagers children, who ventured to play around the hill, were attacked by this \nvicious serpent and stung to death. The serpent extremely resented any noise around \nits dwelling. The villagers tried their utmost to kill the serpent, but met with no \nsuccess. Failing in this, the villagers went in a body to their local hermit and asked \nhim to find a remedy to prevent the death-dealing work of the serpent. \nYielding to the legitimate prayers of the villagers, the hermit went near the hole in the \nhill, where the serpent resided, and by his spiritual powers summoned the serpent to \nappear in his presence. The master hermit scolded the serpent for stinging the \nvillagers children to death, and instructed him never to bite again, but to practice \nloving his enemies. \nThe hermit left the village for a year on a pilgrimage, and as he was returning to the \nvillage by way of the hill, he thought: \"Let me see how my friend the serpent is \nbehaving.\" As he approached the hole in the hill, he found the serpent lying half-dead \nwith several stitches in his back, in front of the hole. \nThe hermit said: \"Hello, Mr. Serpent, what s all this?\" The serpent dolefully \nwhispered: \"Master, this is the result of practicing your teaching. Whenever I came \nout of my hole in quest of food and minded my own business, the village boys noticed \nmy docility and refusal to attack them, and then they threw small stones at me, and \nwhen they found me running away from them they made it their business to throw big \nstones at me, with the object of killing me. Master, I dodged many times, but also got \nbadly hurt many times, and now I am lying here with several stitches in my back \nbecause I have been trying to love my enemies. \nThen the village hermit looked at him and said rebukingly: \"Fool, I told you not to \nsting to death, but why didn t you hiss and scare them away?\" \nThis story illustrates that a person although meek and spiritual, should not be spineless \nor without common sense, and allow himself to be made into a doormat. When \nprovoked or unnecessarily attacked, the spiritual man should try to scare his enemies \naway by a show of anger or strength, but without getting really angry internally. \nHowever, one should never hiss, even with a show of anger, if he has the tendency to \nbite or to materially injure anybody. That is what Jesus did. He hissed at the money \nchangers and scared them away, but did not injure them or become really angry \nhimself. Instead, he tried to put sense into them so that they would not incur bad \nKarma (results of evil action) by blasphemy against the Temple of God. \nJesus said: \"Take these material things away, for they spread material vibrations and \nevoke material thoughts.

The vibration of a candle in the \nchurch throws out the symbolical thought of unruffled peace or of the light of \nWisdom, whereas, oxen in the church remind one of the slaughter house or of farm \nlabor, and so forth. Jesus signified that the church should be so equipped that it would \nemanate only spiritual vibrations. \nJesus distinctly advises that churches should be places of worship and not places for \nthe sale of material thought-arousing objects. It is all right to sell Bibles or books in \nthe Temples if they are sold with a spirit of rendering continuous spiritual service. \nUsing the proceeds from the sale of spiritual books, or using the money for some other \nspiritual purpose, is all right; whereas, a gun sold in a church is contradictory to the \nvibration of the Holy Place. \n \nThe Bhagavad Gita \nMaterial Desires and Meditation \nChapter I, Stanza 12 \nSanskrit: \nTasya sanjanaynyharsam Kurubridha Pitamaha. \nSinghanadam Binodoehai Shankham daddhau protapaban. \nEnglish: \nGrandsire Bhisma, oldest and most powerful of the Kurus, with the purpose of \ncheering Durjodhana, blew his conch shell with a lion-roar. \nSpiritual Interpretation: \nIt must be noticed that Kurjodhana, King Material Desire, did not find any response \nfrom his preceptor Drona, or Habit, even though in the Eleventh Stanza he says: \"Let \nall the soldiers of the restless mind (The Wicked Kurus) get together and protect the \nbodily Ego Consciousness.\" (See July issue of East-West). \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 165, "text": "This is because Preceptor Habit was also the teacher of the discriminative tendencies \n(the Pure Pandus). In other words, the Bad Habit and its wicked mental tendencies, \nare often concentrated on the invading Good Habit and its discriminative tendencies, \nand they have no time to pay attention to the thoughts and urgings of King Material \nDesire to protect the supremely important Ego. In a psychological battle between \ngood and evil tendencies, Bad Habits think themselves of sufficient importance to \ncrush the Good Habits. Usually the Bad Habits do not realize the very important parts \nwhich Material Desire and Ego play. \nIn a psychological battle between the habit of yielding to temptation and the habit of \nself-control, the latter may easily subdue the former, but it is very hard for Good \nHabits to overcome newly created, constantly evolving material desires of the body-\nbound Ego. Material Desire, and Ego, or body consciousness, go together. \nBody consciousness (Bhisma) gives rise to material desire (Durjodhana). Material \ndesires are born, not only due to bad habits, but also to the body attachment of the \nEgo. If this body consciousness, or Ego, is conquered by the consciousness of \nOmnipresence, in Spirit, then King Material Desire and all his armies of sense \ntendencies are instantly slain. Body attachment of the Ego and its desires flee like \ndarkness before the light of Soul s consciousness of Omnipresence. \nOf course, we find King Material Desire (Durjodhana) urging Drona (Habit) and the \nsense soldiers to protect Ego, or body consciousness, (Bhisma) who is the root cause \nof all material desires. \nThe all-knower, Ego, mentally saw that Material Desire did not find any response to \nhis Stanzas, so the Ego sent a strong vibration of determination (blew the conch shell) \nin order to cheer King Material Desire. This prevented him from getting discouraged \nbecause he did not get any response from the Bad Habit which was furiously busy \nmaking plans for fighting Good Habits. \nIt is a fact that in meditation the devotee finds his body consciousness resisting the \nconsciousness of Omnipresence. He also finds that the Ego consciousness often wants \nto make an encouraging noise by breathing fast, and thus inviting the senses to destroy \nthe breathlessness of meditation. The minute the Ego breathes fast, (the blowing of the \nconch shell which produces material sounds through the action of the air) then the \nMaterial Desire of the body is awakened and cheered and fights to drive away the vast \nSpirit Consciousness which is born of our stillness and meditation. \nDuring meditation, any material vibration set forth by the Ego helps to awaken the \nmaterial desire to revive the consciousness of the body, and to dispel the \nconsciousness of the vastness in Spirit. \n"}

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 167, "text": "Jews meant that it was illegal for Jesus to drive away the money changers unless He \nhad Divine authority greater than human laws to do so. \nIt is beautiful to see that Jesus accepted this challenge in a peculiar Divine way. He \ndid not employ a new miracle to convince the Jews of His greatness. He simply told \nthem what was going to happen. Jesus was not in a hurry to convince His enemies. He \nonly said this to demonstrate the wish and work of God in His life. Jesus thought that \nno other proof of His divinity could be greater than the telling about a future event in \nwhich God was to perform the miracle-of-miracles by rebuilding His crucified body \nafter three days. (What Jesus meant has been several times described and performed \nby the Yogis of India.) \nHuman nature is composed of three qualities; namely, good, evil, and activating \nqualities. The soul of man has three dresses: the ideational, astral, and physical, just as \nwe put on an undergarment, a suit, and an overcoat. The Soul of man can only be \nliberated from the bondage of mortal Karma and limitation when it rises above the \ndesires of the physical, Astral, and Spiritual bodies. It takes three distinct efforts for \nthe Soul to leave the physical, Astral, and Ideational bodies. \nSome people take years and many incarnations to accomplish this, but Jesus knew, \nadvanced as He was, that He would be able to liberate His Soul from the limitations of \nthree bodies by three distinct efforts in three days, and would be able to unite it with \nthe unlimited power of the Spirit. \nIt is only when Souls, by desirelessness, are free of the limitations of these three \nbodies that they are not compelled to remain in the Astral or to reincarnate in the \nphysical. It is then that they are imbued with the power of God to re-create any dead \nbody, even as He can. Jesus knew that once He was out of the three bodies, He would \ndemonstrate His Oneness with the Father, and His powers, by re-creating His \ncrucified body as no one could except His Heavenly Father. \nThere is a story that the East Indian Saint, Kabir, told his Hindu and Mohammedan \ndisciples that he would never die, and yet, when he lay in his coffin dead, the first \nthing his Hindu and Mohammedan disciples did was to doubt the truth of his saying \nabout his deathlessness, and they began to fight with one another. The Hindus wanted \nto cremate his dead body and the Mohammedans insisted upon entombing it. \nAt last they fought so hard that their Master Kabir could not keep still any longer and \nhe broke the after-death paramount vow of silence and rose up in his coffin and \nrebuked his disciples. \"Look, you dreamt that I was dead. Lo! I am even living in the \nbody. Since I told you not to fight about anything and then you quarreled about my \ndead dream body, I will convert it into the same Divine Cosmic Dream from which it \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 168, "text": "came.\" Saying this, and blessing them, he said: \"Whatever is left in the coffin, half of \nthat bury, and half of it cremate.\" \nWhen the disciples lifted the coffin lid, they found that their Master ad dematerialized \nthe body and left in its stead a few golden flowers. The Hindus cremated half of these \nflowers and the Mohammedans buried the remaining half. \nIt is said from an authoritative source that our great Guru (preceptor) Shyama Charan \nLahiri Mahasaya of India consciously left his body when his life work was finished, \nand that he appeared again in the flesh the next day in three places. \nGreat saints of India, who have lived knowing and contacting God in their lives, have \nbeen known to raise their bodies after death both before and after the time of Christ. It \nis reported that some saints, like our greatest Guru Babaji, never experience the so-\ncalled human death, but keep their bodies for centuries, and through Eternity, \nenjoying communion as the Infinite God and as the specific finite body. \nOne can see the ocean without the waves, or one can see the ocean as the ocean in the \nwaves. Likewise, some souls see God without the finite body or any delusive waves of \nCreation, and yet others may behold God as the Infinite become the finite, or the \nbody. In the latter case, the soul beholds God become the wave of one or more souls. \nBabaji, the great Guru, experiences himself not apart from God, but perceives that He \nhas become Babaji, you, and me, and all manifestation. In the ultimate experience, \none does not lose his Soul or individuality. One only expands it and finds that God has \nbecome one s soul. \nThe little Soul-Wave, tossed by the storm of dark ignorance, finds itself isolated from \nthe Ocean of Spirit, but when the sunshine of highest wisdom comes, the little Soul-\nWave finds that the Ocean of Spirit has become the Soul-Wavelet. \nBhagavad Gita \nObstacles to Meditation \nChapter I, Stanza 13 \nSANSKRIT \nTasya sanjan ayanaharsam Kurubridah pitamaha sinhanadam binodachai shankham \ndadhou protapaban. \nLITERAL GLOSSARY \n"}

Then this discriminating intelligence, Pandu, by his first consort, the power of \ndispassion, (Kunti) gave birth to the children of the vibrating ether, vitality, and fire \nelements, (The Three Pandu Princes). Then this selfsame pure, discriminating \nintelligence, through his second consort, (Madri), the faculty of attachment to \ndispassion, gave birth to the two offsprings of vibrating water and earth elements, \n(Two Pandu Princes.) \nSPIRITUAL INTERPRETATION \nKing Material Desire had called upon the Preceptor Past Habit to protect General Ego \nwith all the soldiers of the senses, but when the Preceptor Habit did not give inner \nsupport, General Ego himself roared with the vibration of pride. \n"}

THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST \n\"THEN said the Jews: Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt Thou \nrear it up in three days? But He spake of the temple of His body. When, therefore, He \nwas risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this unto them; \nand they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. \nNow, when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, on the feast day, many believed in \nHis name, when they saw the miracles which He did. But Jesus did not commit \nHimself unto them, because He knew all men, and needed not that any should testify \nof man, for he knew what was in man. \nThere was a man of the Pharisees, names Nicodemus, a ruler of the jews. The same \ncame to Jesus by night, and said unto him: Rabbi, we know that Thou art a teacher \ncome from God; for no man can do these miracles that Thou doest, except God be \nwith him. Jesus answered and said unto him: VERILY, VERILY, I SAY UNTO \nTHEE, EXCEPT A MAN BE BORN AGAIN, HE CANNOT SEE THE KINGDOM \nOF GOD.\n \nNicodemus saith unto him: How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the \nsecond time into his mother s womb, and be born? Jesus answered: Verily, verily, I \nsay unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the \nKingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of \nthe Spirit is Spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be born again. The wind \nbloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence \nit cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.\" \nThe Jews misinterpreted the saying of Jesus about raising the temple in three days. \nNaturally they wondered how Jesus could rebuild the temple of Jerusalem in three \ndays if it were destroyed, when it took forty-six years to build it the first time. His \nraising the body after death was much more wonderful than rebuilding a broken \ntemple in three days would have been. \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 174, "text": "At the Passover many believed in Jesus because of His miracles, but Jesus did not \ncount upon man s testimony for the spread of His message. He went on preaching His \ngospel, being impelled by His Infinite Force. \nNicodemus visited Jesus secretly in the night, for he was afraid of social criticism. Yet \nit took a lot of courage, faith, and sincere curiosity for him to seek Jesus. Upon \nmeeting, he declared that only Divine Beings, who had actual God-contact, could \nwork the super-laws which govern the inner life of all Beings and things. \nJesus, in his answer to Nicodemus in the following way: \"VERILY, VERILY, I SAY \nUNTO THEE, EXCEPT A MAN BE BORN AGAIN, HE CANNOT SEE THE \nKINGDOM OF GOD,\" suggests the way in which we can contact God and the way in \nwhich Jesus contacted God. Jesus meant that only super-Beings who contact God can \nperform miracles, and that anyone can contact God and can perform miracles if he is \nborn a second time. \nThe Hindu is Twice-Born \nIn the Hindu Scriptures the newly born child is called Kayastha, which means \"body \nbound.\" The two physical eyes in the child are given by its physical parents to look \ninto alluring matter, but when the child grows older, and at the age of seven, or later, \nis initiated, his Spiritual Eye is opened by his Spiritual father, or Preceptor. Through \nthe help of his Preceptor, the initiate can use this telescopic eye to see Spirit, and then \nhe is called Dwija, or the twice-born, or the Brahmin, or the one who knows Brahma \nor Spirit. \nAlas, even in India this initiation from the body consciousness to the Spiritual \nconsciousness has become just a formal ceremony performed by the priests, who only \nbaptize the body in water, but great Hindu Masters baptize the body in Spirit. John the \nBaptist also said that he baptized with water, but that Jesus was to baptize with Spirit. \nJesus meant that the ordinary consciousness is tied to the flesh, and that through the \ntwo physical eyes and senses, with their limited powers of perception, man can see \nonly into the tiny playhouse of this earth. \nWhen a person is flying in an airplane, he sees no walls, but only the vastness of \nlimitless space and free skies, but if he is suddenly locked up in a little cage \nsurrounded by walls he loses sight of all the vision of vast space. \nLikewise, when man s Soul is thrown out of the vast eternal Spirit into the little bodily \ncage, he beholds nothing but the limitations of matter and the little earth experiences. \nSo, Jesus said, with the modern scientists, that we can see and know as much as our \n"}

The modern microscope can magnify bacteria only 17,000 times, but it is \nnecessary to magnify much more before many persons can see bacteria or particles of \nmatter made of electrons and atoms. \nJesus said that after man s Soul, is born in water or protoplasm, and then by self-\ndevelopment is born again through the awakening of the sixth sense, intuition, and the \nopening of the Spiritual Eye, his illumined Soul goes out of the body and can then \nenter into the Kingdom of God. \nJust as, by a 200-inch telescope, a man can enter into the vast region of star-peopled \nspace, so by developing the intuitional sense through meditation he can enter the \nKingdom of God and behold the birthplace of thoughts, stars, and Souls. \nJesus meant that body-bound Souls can see nothing but limited matter through the \nsmall outer windows of their senses. It is only when Soul opens the inner window of \nOneness with the Spirit by meditation that he can enter into the perception of the \nvastness of omnipresent Spirit. \nJesus said that the body born of flesh has the limitations of the flesh, whereas the \nSoul, born of the Spirit, has potentially limitless powers. The ordinary man knows \nhimself as so many pounds of flesh. Such a person, being born of flesh, sees nothing \nbut flesh or matter in and around him, but when, by meditation, the Soul s mind is \ntransferred from the body to the invisible powerful presence of the Soul, then it \nrealizes its Oneness with the eternal Spirit and not with the limited body. Jesus said, \nas the Hindu Masters have said, that man has to be born in body and in Spirit in order \nto know God. \nNicodemus could not see how a Soul could be born twice, so he asked Jesus if He \nmeant that old men could reincarnate in their mother s bodies and become young \nagain. Jesus was not talking of reincarnation; that is, of a second birth after one birth \nand death.

Just as the source of the wind is hidden, and is known by its sound, so the \nSpirit substance is invisible, hidden beyond the grasp of human senses, and the birth \nof Souls from the Spirit is the visible phenomena. By the sound, the invisible wind is \nknown. By the birth of intelligent Souls, the invisible Spirit is manifest. \nJesus was only stating that, as it is difficult to find the source of the wind, so it is \ndifficult to find the Spirit source from which all things come. Jesus said that all Souls \nborn of Spirit are known by their existence, but very few know all about the Spirit \nsource from which they come. \nThe Bhagavad Gita  \nPhysical and Astral Sounds \nChapter I, Stanza 14 \nTatah sankhascha Bahijarshcha Panabanaka Gomukhah Sahasaibavhyahanyanta sah \nshabdastumulobhabat Tatah (them); sankhascha (conch shells and); bhaijarscha (kettle \ndrums); panabanaka gomukah (trumpets, tabors, and cow horns); sahasa aba (most \nsuddenly); abhyahanyanta (blew forth); sah shabdastumulobhabat (that sound was \ntremendous). \nIn the 12th and 13th Stanzas we saw how the Ego consciousness revives material \ndesire and the senses by disrupting the calm breath. The four factors of mind, breath, \nvital essence, and body are ever interrelated. When any one of the four factors is \ndisturbed, the other three automatically become disturbed too. \nHence, the devotee who aspires to develop uniformly and steadily in spirituality must \nalways calm the mind with the practice of concentration, keep the breath quiet by \nproper breathing exercises, preserve the vital essence by self-control and good \ncompany, and keep the body quiet and not in perpetual motion and restlessness. \nWhen Ego disturbs the breath after deep meditation, the Soul again tries to revive its \nintuitive consciousness by the revival of Astral vibrations.

As the body is woven with tissues of flesh, so the Astral body is \nwoven with filaments of the electrical Life Force. \nThe circulation, pumping of the heart, and movement of breathing in the physical \nbody all emanate physical sounds. The Soul hears these sounds when it is \nconcentrated on the inside of the body. When the Soul, as Ego, concentrates upon the \noutside body, it hears the sounds of the physical world, but as the Soul, in meditation, \npasses from the physical sounds of matter and the droning sounds of circulation, and \nthe thump of the heart, it begins to hear the various vibratory sounds of the Astral vital \nforces, like the blowing of conch shells, or round, full, rolling vibrations. \nIn the battle between the Ego and the senses pulling towards the body, and the Soul \nmoving towards the Astral, the devotee hears the roaring sound of the breath when he \nbecomes identified with the body, but listens to the Astral bells and music of the \nspheres when he approaches the Soul through the Astral Kingdom. \nStanza 12 specially describes those ugly vibrations of the senses (Kurus), which keep \nthe devotee s attention upon the internal physical body.

Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that \nWe have seen, and ye receive not our Witness. If I have told you earthly things, \nand ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things? And no \nman hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the \nSon of Man which is in heaven.\" \n\"And as Moses lifted up that serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of \nMan be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have \neternal life. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that \nwhosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God \nsent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through \nhim might be saved. \nHe that believeth on Him is not condemned. But he that believeth not is \ncondemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten \nSon of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and \nmen loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone \nthat doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be \nreproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made \nmanifest that they are wrought in God.\" \nJesus told Nicodemus that it took more than being a master of the house of Israel to \nknow the mysteries of life. Nicodemus was informed by Jesus that the spiritual \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Master on Scriptures (189p).pdf", "page": 179, "text": "things which He was describing were known only by intuitive experience. \"WE \nSPEAK THAT WE DO KNOW\" means something deeper than the knowledge \nderived through the senses of understanding. Human knowledge percolates through \nthe senses, understanding, and intuition. \nThe senses are limited in their powers, so is understanding, which depends upon \nthe senses for its data. If the senses lie, the conclusion drawn by the understanding \non that data is also incorrect. If you see in the distance a white cloth that looks like \na ghost, you conclude that there is a ghost, but coming nearer to the object you \ndiscover the error of your conclusion. \nThe senses and understanding are the outer doors through which knowledge of the \npneumena, or the eternal substance, percolates into the Soul. The senses and \nunderstanding are deluded because they do not know or see the real nature of all \ncreated things. Jesus, with his intuition, knew the real nature of the cosmos and of \nlife, so He said authoritatively: \"WE DO KNOW.\" \nJesus regretted that Nicodemus doubted the intuitional experiences of the Christ \nstate, and He said to Nicodemus: \"If I tell you about matters pertaining to human \nSouls who are visibly present on earth, and how they can enter into the Kingdom \nof God, and you believe not, then how can you believe me if I tell you about \nhappenings in Heaven or the Astral realm, which are completely hidden from the \nordinary human gaze?\" \nAll Astral Bodies and Souls Are Projected From Heaven \nJesus went on to say that no man can ascend to Heaven except the one who came \ndown from Heaven. A man is composed of a Soul and the three ideational, astral, \nand spiritual bodies. Just as the little threads of flame coming through the holes of \na gas burner are all individualized flames coming out of the one flame under the \nburner plate, so also Souls are individualized Spirit. The one flame of Spirit lies \nunder all things and comes out individualized threads of Soul-flames through each \nhuman Soul and through every living thing. \nThe threads of flame first come out of one big flame, and when the light is put out \nthey go back to the same flame. To do that, the little flames have to come out of \nthe big flame. This illustrates what Jesus said about Souls ascending and \ndescending from heaven. The Spirit projects the desire, then the Soul projects the \nidea of the body, then the idea becomes energy or Astral body, and the Astral body \nbecomes condensed into the physical body. \n"}

This Heavenly region is the abode of all Astral forces and \nangels. Thus Jesus said that no physical body could get back into the Astral \nKingdom which did not in the first place come out of the Astral plane. In other \nwords, all men were first created as Souls with Astral bodies in the Heavenly astral \nKingdom. From there they were projected into matter as men with physical bodies. \nThen the logical conclusion is that all supermen who conquered material desires \nand were promoted back to Heaven were originally in Heaven and had fallen from \nthere through earth-bound desires. \nJesus spoke of a very strange truth when He said: \"Even the Son of Man which is \nin heaven.\" Jesus often used the phrase, \"Son of Man\" whenever he referred to His \nown or to any physical body. So Jesus said that the Son of Man, His own physical \nbody, could exist in the finer Astral Kingdom as well as on the earth. The highest \nHindu Yoga Scripture tells how some Yogis have the power to appear in two \nplaces at the same time in two similar bodies. It is said that some Yogis never die, \nbut carry their bodies into the Spirit, and never lose their personality or \nindividuality. \nJust as the ocean and the wave can exist together, so some Saints with their bodies \nare said to exist eternally in God without ever melting the bodily form in the \nCosmic Ocean. Other Saints are said to become One with the Spirit and dissolve \nthe bodily wave in the Spiritual Ocean. Such Saints only materialize their bodies \nwhen they want to come on earth to bring back deluded Souls unto God. \nJesus spoke of His body which dwelt simultaneously in the Astral and the physical \nworlds because He was conscious of both His physical body and His Astral body. \nOrdinary Souls behold their bodies roaming only on the earth, but advanced Souls, \nlike Jesus, can see their Souls simultaneously present in the physical and in the \nAstral Kingdoms. This is also proven by the fact that, although Jesus experienced \ndeath as the Son of Man, or physical body, still He was conscious of the Astral \nKingdom all the time, and after death He raised his physical and took it back to \nHeaven. \nThe Soul is encased in the Idea body of thirty-four ideas. \nMoses Lifting the Serpent in the Wilderness \nThe Soul is encased in the Idea body through delusion. This Idea body, through \ndesires, is tied to the Astral body, and the Astral body is fitted in all details to the \nfinest mechanisms of the physical body. The Astral body is tied to the physical \n"}

The last tie which binds the Astral body \nto the physical body is the attachment emanating through a coiled knot at the base \nof the spine, called by Hindu Saints, the Kundalini, or Serpent Force. Jesus spoke \nof this Serpent being lifted by Moses in the wilderness. That is, Moses, in the \nwilderness of silence, by deep meditation, learned the art of relaxing or of \nconsciously withdrawing the Astral body from the physical body by first doing \naway with bodily attachment, and then be reversing the Astral current from the \nsenses to the spine, Godward, through the coiled passage at the base of the spine. \nUnless one knows how to open this coiled knot of Astral and physical power at the \nbase of the spine, one cannot enter into the Astral Kingdom. \nJesus said that each Son of Man, or each bodily consciousness, must be lifted from \nthe plane of the senses to the Astral Kingdom by reversing the Life Force through \nthe serpent-like coiled passage at the base of the spine. Every time you meditate \ndeeply, you automatically reverse the Life Force and consciousness from matter to \nGod. This helps to loosen the Astral and physical knot at the base of the spine. \nFew people know about this Kundalini and often confuse it with sex force. That is \nwhy so many ignorant teachers make a mystery about it and frighten their gullible \ndisciples by telling them that it is dangerous to awaken this Life Force (Kundalini). \nIt takes years of meditation under the guidance of a competent Teacher-Guru \nbefore one can dream of releasing the Astral from its bondage to the physical by \nawakening the Kundalini. \nAnd as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man \nbe lifted up: that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal \nlife. For God so loved the world that he gave his only Begotten Son, that whosever \nbelieveth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\n(\"Walks and Words \nof Jesus,\" by Rev. M. N. Olmsted.) \nThese passages are interpreted in the following and are very important. Moses, and \nJesus Himself, along with the Hindu Yogis, knew the secret of scientific spiritual \nlife. That is why they unanimously said that all physically-minded people must \nknow the art of lifting up the serpent force in order to accomplish the first retracing \nof the inward steps towards the Spirit. \nThe Son of Man  \nWas Savior of the Disciples  \nAnd Other People  \n"}

But \nJesus realized that His physical body was to remain on the earth plane for a little \nwhile only, so He said that in His absence people would be able to find God. \nThe Only Begotten Son of God Is the Savior of People For All Times \nThis confusion between Son of Man, Son of God, and Only Begotten Son, has \ncreated much bigotry in the followers of churchianity, who never want to \nacknowledge the human element in Jesus and that Jesus was a God-man who \nevolved and became God Himself. If Jesus were God Himself from the beginning, \nthen His life and His struggles before crucifixion and at the cross were nothing but \nDivine Acting. However, a superman Jesus, who, by spiritual discipline became \nGod Himself through His efforts, stirs more hope of salvation in the human heart \nthan a God-manufactured Jesus. No doubt a God-made Jesus could conquer \ntemptation, and while on the cross could say: \"Father, forgive them, for they know \nnot what they do,\" but how could this be expected of a human being of manifold \nfrailties. \nSons of God Existed Before and After Jesus \nBefore and after the coming and passing of Jesus, Sons of God existed. Jesus never \nset a limit to time. He Himself said: \"All those who received Him, to them He gave \nthe power to become the Sons of God.\" As the sunlight shines equally in the same \ndegree on the diamond and on the charcoal, so also, God sheds His light equally on \nthe diamond and the charcoal mentalities. The difference is that the believing \ndiamond mentalities receive and reflect the rays of God more than the doubting \ncharcoal mentalities. So, all Souls who, by meditation, become pure and \ntransparent, will be able to receive and reflect God and be called Sons of God. \nEach Soul who leaves delusion and becomes One with God is termed a Son of \nGod.

The \nonly way to convince him that the talking picture is nothing but a play of electric \nvibrations is to take him near the screen and let him touch the shadowy pictures, \nand feel their unreal nature. Another way to convince the bushman that the talking \npictures are nothing but electric vibrations and shadows is to take him to the booth \nand show him how the torrent of electric light emanating from the little opening in \nthe operating room carries the realistic pictures and projects them on the screen. \nLikewise, to the materialist, the whole world, with all its complications of solids, \nliquids, fire, gases, and so forth, seems to be composed of real material objects, but \nwhen the Yogi, advanced on the path of inner perception, says: \"This world and the \nCosmos are only shadows of life thrown on the screen of space, or that the world \nconsists of dream pictures reflected in our conscious and subconscious chamber, \njust as the electric flood of light going out of the booth can be seen to be like a \ntransparent searchlight without any visible pictures, so also God, from His Booth \nin the Center of Eternity is throwing a spherical bundle of rays of invisible \nsearchlights, producing an endless variety of apparently realistic pictures on the \nscreen of space. \nTo be more scientific, the Yogi, with closed eyes, peering into the invisible \ndarkness, finds six booths of the coccygeal, sacral, lumbar, dorsal, cervical, and \nChrist Centers in the spinal column, and the point between the eyebrows. By \nconcentrating upon the Six Centers, he first hears the music of the bumble bee, \nflute, harp, gong bell, sea roar, and a symphony of all the Astral sounds emanating \nfrom the Six Centers, respectively, as described before, and representing the \nvibration of various elements. \nJust as the electric flood of light thrown on the screen makes a peculiar noise, due \nto electric vibration, so the various spinal Centers, throwing off different currents \nin space, producing the true-to-sight, true-to-touch, true-to-hearing, true-to-smell, \nand true-to-taste picture of the body, emanate different musical sounds. \nThe true-to-touch picture of the body is produced by an earth current in the coccyx, \nby a water vibration in the sacral, fire vibration in the lumbar, air vibration in the \ndorsal, ether vibration in the cervical, and consciousness and life vibration in the \nmedulla and Christ Center. \n"}

The lumbar center keeps \nup the Astral and electrical heat of the body and oozes out the beautiful sound of a \nharp. The dorsal center keeps the oxygen and air elements in the body combining \nwith the flesh and sends forth the sound of a gong bell. \nThe cervical plexus maintains the etheric background in the body and times it to all \nspatial vibrations. This cervical center reverberates with the Cosmic Vibration of \nocean rumblings. The Christ Center, in the medulla and in the point between the \neyebrows, is the dynamo of consciousness, Life Force, and elemental vibrations, \nwhich mainly keep the elements of life, consciousness, flesh, blood, heat, air, and \nether of the body continuously recharged. \nIn other words, the body is not as it appears to be. It is a combination of Six \nCurrents, emanating form the Six Plexuses. First, the Spiritual aspirant, who wants \nto know about the mystery picture of the body, has his attention withdrawn from \nthe body to the inner six booths, which throw six currents and produce the \nconsciousness of the body. By the knowledge of these Six Currents, in the Six \nCenters, and by years of higher meditation, the veteran Yogi learns to know the \nbody as a combination of Six Currents and not as a solid mass. \nThe operator in the booth knows that the talking pictures are unreal, combinations \nof light and sound, but the audience takes the pictures to be realistic. Likewise, the \nYogi, concentrating upon the inner operating booths of the Six Centers, beholds \nthe body as a combination of various currents, while the people of the world \nbehold the body as a solid substance.
