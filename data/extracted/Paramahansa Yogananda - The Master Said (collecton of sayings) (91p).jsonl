But \nnow and then there appears on earth one of that noble lineage of God-realized souls of \nwhose existence the Master of twenty centuries ago hinted: “He that believeth on me, the \nworks that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do.”\nMen become Masters through discipline of the little self, or ego; through elimination of \nall desires save one – the desire for God; through singlehearted devotion to Him; and \nthrough deep meditation, or communion of the individual soul with the Universal Spirit. \nOnly that man whose consciousness is unshakably established in the Lord, the sole Reality, is \nrightfully called “Master.”\n________________\nIt is the hope of the Master’s disciples that this little book will inspire many hearts with a \ndeep desire for God.\nParamhansa Yogananda, the Master whose words are lovingly recorded here, was a \nteacher whose spiritual magnitude can scarcely be comprehended by those who have not \nexplored the same realms of divine consciousness. From Africa to Alaska, through his \nteachings and such writings as  Autobiography of a Yogi, Whispers from Eternity,  and \nnumerous other books, he ignited the spark of love for God in the hearts of men. \nA college education and many years of spiritual training in his native India, under the \nSpartan discipline of his own spiritual teacher or guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar, prepared \nYoganandaji* for his mission in the West. With a love for God that fired his soul with \nunceasing zeal, Paramhansaji was undaunted by the darts of mistrust and prejudice that \nsometimes met his efforts; and surely and steadily, through his lectures and his writings, he \nawakened sleeping souls in every nation of the globe and brought them where his own heart \nlay – at the feet of God. \nThrough his life and teachings he proved the precepts of original Christianity and original \nYoga to  be identical,  and  wove them into a unified message – the message of  Self-\nRealization. This was his mission, which began in 1920 when he was invited to Boston as a \ndelegate to a Congress of Religious Liberals. He established the Self-Realization Fellowship, \nthrough which he brought a teaching so practical, so abundant, that it stirred a spiritually \nsluggish world to its very depths. Into the confusion of creeds and dogmas he brought the \nharmony of one divine truth that all men may share. \nHere was a man who set aside family attachment to serve the larger family of truth-\nseekers  throughout  the  world,  a  man  who  was  not  afraid  to  live  Christianity  and  to \n* See glossary\n 4\n"}

Sparkling beside it \nis his loving understanding of and compassion for all mankind. \nAn account such as this, compiled by the Master’s disciples, might be deemed prejudiced, \nbut the following true incident from Paramhansaji’s life illustrates the loving reception given \nhim by all men of goodwill and understanding, regardless of creed. \nParamhansaji  was  traveling  in  the  United  States,  and  stopped  one  day  to  visit  a \nmonastery. The brothers received him with some apprehension, noting his dark skin, long \nblack hair, and ocher robe – traditional garb of monks of the Swami Order. Thinking him a \nheathen from some godless land, they were about to refuse him an audience with the abbot, \nwhen that good man entered the room. With beaming face and open arms, he approached and \nembraced Paramhansaji, exclaiming, “Man of God! I am happy you have come.”\nIn  a  similar  creedless  spirit,  the  disciples  of  Paramhansa  Yogananda  present  this \ncollection of his words, garnered from treasured diaries and cherished memories, that the \nreader may share in some measure the joy of instruction at the feet of a Master. \n \n 5\n"}

No other light is necessary.”\n*****\n“Master, Dr. Lewis was your first disciple in this country, wasn’t he?”\nThe Master answered, “That’s what they say.”\nSeeing that the questioner was a little bit taken aback, he added, “I never say that \npeople are my disciples. God is the Guru. They are His disciples.”\n*****\nSome people seem to defy progress itself, preferring their own well-worn ruts of \nthought and activity. The Master said, “I call such people psychological antiques. You \nmust not be a psychological antique, so that when you die the angels say, ‘Oh! This is \nan antique coming. Let us send him back to earth!’”\n*****\nSome of the disciples, caught up in the whirl of activity, were neglecting their \nmeditation.* Seeing this the Master said: \n“Do not say, ‘Tomorrow I will meditate longer. Tomorrow I will do this and that.’ \nYou will suddenly find that a year has passed by without your having done anything \nyou intended. Instead say, “This can wait and that can wait, but my search for God \ncannot wait.’”\n*****\nA disciple with a logical turn of mind was inclined to argue with the Master. And \nthe Master said, “You must not argue with me, for in your reasonable thought you \nwill miss much truth. You must with faith be always in tune with what I say or ask \nyou to do. You will find better results, and blessings.” \n* See Kriya Yoga in glossary\n 6\n"}

If the will is weak and \nyour ambition is dead, then you have lost life already. But you must not let ambition \nproduce attachment. If you seek things for yourself, that is destructive; if you seek \nthings for others, that is expansive; and if you seek to please only God, that is freeing \nto the soul.” \n*****\nOne man, although deeply attracted to the Master, would not listen to his advice, \nbut the Master said of him, “I cannot be angry, for I see that God is in his heart. He \nmakes many bad mistakes, but he is good and God knows that. If he would let me I \nwould lead him to God, but nevertheless he will get there in time. He is a Cadillac \nstuck in the mud.” \n*****\nWhen a friend criticized the use of advertising to spread the Self-Realization \nteachings, the Master said, “If Wrigley can use ads to make people chew gum, why \nshouldn’t I use ads to make people chew good ideas?”\n*****\n* Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF).\n 7\n"}

He hung the moon and the stars in the sky so that \npeople would know He is there”. \n*****\nA skeptical caller told the Master, “I have always believed in God but it has never \ndone me any good”.\nAnd the Master said, “Belief is good if it inspires you to practice the truths that \ncaused you to believe. But belief must be converted into experience. Then you have \nfaith, and that is when God can do you good!”\n*****\nWarning the disciples against the company of evil people, the Master said, “You \ncannot be around either a rose or a skunk without being affected by it. So it is best to \nassociate only with human roses”. \n*****\nA disciple had the unpleasant habit of often telling to others his own doubts about \nGod. To him the Master said, “It is serious enough when you are bad, but when you \ntalk about it and influence others to be bad, the divine Law will punish you severely”. \n***** \nPointing  out  the  folly  of  bad  company,  the  Master  said,  “Peeling  garlic  or \nsqueezing a rotten egg leaves unwanted smells on the hands, which will then require a \nlot of washing.”\n*****\n A disciple questioned, “What value have books?”\nAnd the Master said, “Books are meant to inspire the devotee, to encourage him to \na greater zeal for God. But the mistake comes when he reads dead books – those \nwithout God in their pages, and when he reads too much, never practicing the good \nthings he learns.

God created routine. The sun shines until dusk and the \nstars shine until dawn.”\n*****\nOn the subject of brotherhood the Master said, “God is trying the evolve the art of \nhigh living by expressing His truth through a combination of particular civilizations, \nmentalities, and nationalities. No nation is complete in itself. An emulation and \ncollection of the best in all nationalities will supply us with the best information on \nthe art of living. It is important to note that all the great saints attained the best in all \ncivilizations, and manifested the highest ideals embodied in all true religions.”\n*****\nA student once confided to the Master that he feared he could not continue on the \nspiritual path because his bad habits were so strong it wore him out fighting them. \n“I’m too caught up in mistakes to make any progress,” he said sadly. \nAnd the Master said, “Will you be better able to fight tomorrow than today? You \nhave to turn to God some time, so isn’t it better to do it now? Just give yourself to \nHim and say, ‘Lord, naughty or good I am Thy child. Thou must take care of me.’ If \nyou keep on and don’t stop trying you will change. A saint is a sinner who never gave \nup.”\n*****\nTo a young devotee seeking his advice the Master said, “The world creates bad \nhabits in you, but the world will not stand responsible for your actions springing from \nthose habits. Then why give all your time to the world? Reserve even an hour a day \nfor actual scientific soul-exploration. Doesn’t the Giver of the world itself, of your \nfamily, money, and everything, deserve one twenty-fourth part of your time?”\n*****\nThe Master often stressed the need for balance between activity and meditation on \nthe spiritual path. “When you work for God, not self, it is just as good as meditation. \nThe work helps your meditation and meditation helps your work. You need the \n 9\n"}

With \nactivity only the mind becomes restless and you forget God.”\n*****\nCautioning some of the disciples against losing their spiritual balance, the Master \nsaid, “Duty to the body must not contradict duty to the mind; and duty to the mind \nmust not contradict duty to the soul. Remember, if you do your duty to the soul, body \nand mind will benefit too, but if you neglect the soul, then body and mind will suffer \nno matter what you do.”\n*****\nThe familiar Bible quotation, “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man \nhear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and \nhe with me,” the Master explained thus: “Christ is seeking to enter the doors of your \ndevotion, but you have latched them with your restlessness.”\n*****\nThe Master, encouraging his students to follow God’s laws for the care of the \nbody as well as the soul, once said, “The body is the link between our higher and \nlower nature, the cart that carries within it the essence of all we may be – in fact, all \nwe shall be eventually.*  Why not speed up the transition through proper diet and \nother health measures?”\n*****\nOne disciple, greatly distressed because a fellow-disciple seemed to be making \ngreater spiritual progress than he, complained to the Master about God’s seeming lack \nof cooperation with his own efforts. And the Master said: \n“You too much keep your eyes on the platter instead of on your own dish, thinking \nof what you didn’t get instead of what has been given you.”\n*****\n* God has equipped the body of man, alone among His creatures, with the secret spinal centers whose \nawakening (by yoga or, in some cases, by intense devotional fervor) confers divine illumination. The Hindu \nscriptures therefore teach (1) that a human body is a precious gift, and (2) that man cannot work out his \nsalvation except in physical encasement. He will reincarnate on this earth again and again, until he is a Master. \nOnly then will the human body have fulfilled the purpose for which it was created. \n 10\n"}

He told the story to the Master, who said, “One does not do good without \nbeing criticized. But what of it? Those who love God don’t take their eyes from Him. \nIn pleasure and pain, sickness and health, success and failure, they are unshaken. That \nis how you must be. What is said won’t affect what I am unless I am weak and let in \nthe negative thoughts of criticism. You see, it is not others who make us suffer, but \nourselves. Why listen to negative things? You are concerned with God.”\n*****\nThe Master was returning late one night to Mount Washington,* after a visit to his \ndesert retreat. Seeing a quiet park as he passed through a small town, he asked that the \ncar be stopped, and then requested everyone to get out and take a little exercise. A \nnumber of passers-by were obviously curious about the little group taking its exercise \nat such an odd hour, and the exercisers felt slightly uncomfortable at being a part of \nthis exhibition. But the Master said, “They think it is unusual only because they don’t \ndo it.”\n*****\nA man and his wife came to the hermitage to make the Master’s acquaintance. \nWhile there the man said, “I like your teachings and your words are very practical. \nBut are you a Christian?”\nAnd the Master said, “Didn’t Jesus say, ‘Why call ye me Lord, and do not the \nthings which I say?’ Today there is ‘churchianity’ and Christianity. Going to church \non Sunday and being a devil the rest of the week is heathen. But keeping God in the \nheart all the time and doing what Christ taught – that is being a Christian. It is for you \nto decide whether or not you think I do that.”\n*****\n“You are very hard to understand, Master!” a disciple remarked.

But if there is too much, everyone forgets what it is all about.”\n*****\nTo the congregation of the Self-Realization Fellowship* Church at San Diego the \nMaster once said: “Let the church cathedral remind you of your own cathedral within, \nwhere you should go in the dead of night and in the dawn. There you can listen to the \nmighty organ music of Om,* and hear in it the sermon of divine wisdom.”\n*****\nThe Master, always open-handed, ever giving away that which was given him, \nsurprised the disciples one day by saying, “I don’t believe in charity.” Noting the \namazed looks on the faces of those about him, he added, “It enslaves people. But to \ndo things for people that will help them to help themselves is important and is greater \nthan any material charity.”\n*****\nCounseling the disciples against too much visiting, the Master said, “Don’t mix \nwith people too closely. The desire for companionship is in reality the soul’s desire \nfor companionship with God. But the more you seek to satisfy that desire outwardly, \nthe more you will lose of divine companionship. Friendships that are not rooted in \nlove for God only make men restless and dissatisfied.”\n*****\nThe Master had talked for a long time about creation and why God started it.

Enlarge the cup of your \nreceptivity and then you will be able to hold the ocean of infinite wisdom.”\n*****\nTwo disciples, angry with one of their brothers, took their lengthy and unjust \ncomplaints to the Master. He listened in silence and when they were through he said, \n“Change yourselves.” \n*****\nA student who was dissatisfied with his station in life complained to the Master \nthat he thought God should have given him a better role in the cosmic drama. Why, \nwas his plaint, should some people have to play inferior parts?\nAnd the Master said, “It is absolutely impossible to have a play if every one of the \nplayers is the star.”\n*****\nAfter pointing out a disciple’s error, the Master said, “You must not feel sensitive \nbecause I correct you. It is because you are winning all the time that I show you the \nway of self-discipline. I bless you every day for a glorious future in good. I use so \nmuch caution lest you get used to mechanical habits and forget to make daily the \ndeep, thirsty, supreme, conscious effort to reach God.”\n*****\nGood advice was given all mothers when the Master said:\n“Train the will of your children. When they become self-willed about something \nthat is right, don’t call them bad. Don’t curtail their freedom, but give suggestions \nwith love and understanding of their own little desires. If you try to save time by \nbeating them, you will lose time. Reason with the child and then say nothing. Let him \nget his own little hard knocks and he will then understand. He will learn much \nsooner.” \n(The Master’s disciples have often observed that he followed his own advice with \nchildren of all ages, helping them to develop their own wills and understanding of \ntheir individual capacity to accept and follow. He seldom admonished a person twice; \nrather, he reasoned with the “child” and then said nothing. The wisdom of his \ninstruction has many times been proved through those disciples who perfectly follow \nit.)\n 13\n"}

That’s why I was sent here.”\n*****\nA disciple who did not have much devotion came to the hermitage. Every time the \nMaster saw him he would say, “Get devotion! You must have devotion. Remember \nwhat Jesus said: ‘Father, thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and \nhast revealed them unto babes.’”\nSome time later this disciple was with a group of others visiting the Master at his \ndesert retreat. It was near Christmas time, and the Master, taking some toys out of a \nbox, began playing with them. After enjoying them for a time, just like a child, he \nasked this intellectual disciple how he liked them.

If we love souls, we must not try to keep them near us for our \npleasure  and  comfort.  If  we  really  love  them,  we  will  continue  to  love  them, \nparticularly when they are taken away from us to advance on their path toward soul \nfreedom, or when they are called to rest in the bosom of the Father.\n“In the sorrow of separation from their loved ones, fools cry for awhile and then \nforget, but the wise find the impulse to seek their lost love in the heart of the Eternal. \nWhat we lose in finite life we must seek in the chamber of Infinity.”\n*****\nLooking at the stars glimmering overhead while he enjoyed an evening stroll with \nsome of the disciples, the Master said: “How many tiny stars you are – stars of atoms! \nIf your life force were suddenly released you would cover the whole sky. Some great \nsaints, when they die, see their life spread over all space. It is a beautiful experience.”\n*****\nTwo of the disciples were discussing their spiritual progress with the Master while \nenjoying the sunshine. One said, “My desire for God is very great.” And the Master \nsaid:\n“That is the greatest blessing, to feel His pull on your heart. When that desire \ncomes it is His way of saying, ‘Too long you have played with the toys of My \ncreation. Now I want you with Me – come home!’”\n*****\nOne of the disciples asked the Master, “Is it good to believe blindly?”\nAnd the Master said, “There are two kinds of doubt, destructive and constructive. \nDestructive doubt is habitual skepticism. People who have this mental habit never do \nanything to find out the truth. \n“On the other hand, constructive doubt is intelligent questioning. It isn’t good to \nhave arbitrary disbelief without investigation, for this kind of doubt is the static on \nyour mental radio that causes you to lose the program within.”\n 15\n"}

They  never  cease  unless  curbed.  Desires  should  be \nconverted into the desire for God alone. Then only can one find happiness.” \n*****\nA new student, eager to circumvent the trial of this terrestrial sphere, was told by \nthe Master, “The Divine Physician is holding you in the hospital of delusion until \nyour disease of desire for material things is cured.

It is the heart that God watches, not the \noutward actions of a person.”\n*****\nThe Master was expounding the evils of gossip, and he told the disciples, “My \nguru Sri Yukteswar used to say, ‘If it isn’t something I can tell everybody, I don’t \nwant to hear it.’”\n*****\nThe Master was indeed the meekest of the meek so long as those around him were \nsincere, but when the need for correction arose he could be like steel. Once when a \ndisciple, having seen the soft side of the Master, took advantage of it and neglected \nhis duties, Master scolded him severely. Seeing the amazement in the disciple’s eyes \nat his unexpected discipline, the Master said, “We get along fine until you do \nunreasonable things. Then I remember my position and have to correct your faults.”\n*****\nA man meeting the Master for the first time asked, “One of your students told me \nthat you are his guru. What did he mean?”\nAnd the Master said, “‘Guru’ means one who leads from the darkness of ignorance \nto the light of wisdom. Such a spiritual teacher, knowing God, has but one desire – to \nimplant the love of Him in others. He shows the devotee that God alone is the goal of \nlife and tells him how to get there. It is not I who am the guru – God is the only guru – \nbut God has made me His instrument.”\n*****\nDisciples  deemed  it  a  privilege  to  render  service  to  the  guru,  who  labored \nunceasingly for their welfare. To two monks who had performed some small courtesy \nfor him the Master said, “You are all so kind to me with your many attentions.” A \ndisciple hastily replied, “O no! It’s you who are kind to us, Master!”\nAnd the Master said, smiling sweetly, “God is helping God. That is His drama.”\n 33\n"}

I will not interfere with Thy plan for me by \nharboring any desires of my own.’”\n*****\nReminding the disciples of the need for good company, the Master said, “This \nsimile should be remembered: milk cannot float on water, but the butter that is \nchurned out of it can. Similarly, a man whose childhood has been spent in churning \nthe butter of Self-realization from the milk of his mind is able to remain in the world, \nactive for God, without getting mixed up with worldly desires and attachments.”\n*****\nAfter praising a disciple the Master said, “When you are told you are good you \nmust not relax, but try to become better. To be better means more happiness for \nyourself and for those who think of your welfare.”\n*****\nThe Master constantly stressed the importance of good company and right action. \n“Every good action,” he would say, “is like a pickax that digs into the soil of \nconsciousness and brings forth the fountain of God’s joy.”\n*****\nA student expressed surprise that a bad person who decides to be good should \nthereafter encounter difficulty, but the Master explained, “The man rolling down hill \nfinds no resistance, but as soon as he wants to climb up he meets with great resistance. \n 34\n"}

The \nreal leader is that one who has learned to follow and who doesn’t idolize his job as \nleader. Those who want praise and approval from the people don’t deserve our \nadmiration, but he who serves all has a right to sit on the throne of our hearts.

The next time, sing to God, and not to me nor to \nanyone else.”\n*****\nA student with a scientific turn of mind asked the Master, “Does creation go \nthrough a process of evolution?”\nAnd the Master said: “Evolution is a suggestion of God in the human mind, \nbecause actually everything that is going on is going on in the present. \nIn the mind of God there is no evolution, as there is no change in the beam of light \nthat is instrumental in manifesting all the transient scenes of motion pictures.

The soul, having lost its contact with God-Bliss, tries to satisfy itself with \npseudo pleasures of the senses; but the soul of even the most worldly person is \ninwardly conscious of its lost supernal Bliss, and that is why it can never remain \nsatisfied for long with temporary sense pleasures only, no matter how alluring they \nmay be. The worldly man goes on searching for his lost happiness in God by flying \nfrom one sense pleasure to another. At last, when he suffers from satiety, he begins to \nseek God-Bliss within, where alone it can be found.”\n*****\nExplaining the state of the soul in the worldly man, the Master said, “The soul is \nclouded over with matter and material instincts. Like a caterpillar in a cocoon, man is \nsurrounded  by  his  silken,  clinging,  temporarily  sweet  prenatal  and  postnatal \ntendencies. He must cast them off and spread the gorgeous, delicate wings of his \nhidden soul before the silkman Death gets him.”\n*****\n“Master, can a soul really be lost forever?”\n“Impossible! The soul is a part of God. How can you destroy God?”\n*****\nWhile talking with a group of typical American businessmen and their wives, the \nMaster said, “Don’t think so much about material security.

Self-control means channeling the energy \nand the thought away from wrong desires by applying it to right thoughts and actions. \nThose who dwell on evil hurt themselves, but those who put it out of their minds by \nthinking  good  thoughts  and  performing  good  actions  spare  themselves  untold \nsuffering and misery.”\n*****\nLong ago one of the disciples said to Master, “Don’t forget, blood is thicker than \nwater.”\nAnd the Master said, “Blood may be thicker than water, but Spirit is finer than \nblood!”\n*****\nOnce, after giving a severe scolding to a disciple the Master said, “So sorry I had \nto mend you so much.

Then I knew that I had a place in the heart of God – that I was not forsaken.”\n*****\nFor those who think that saints enjoy their blessed reward as a result of some \npartiality on God’s part the Master had a good answer: “God chooses those who \nchoose Him.”\n*****\nThe Master always urged everyone to start now in his search for God. “Remember, \nevery day lost leaves you that much farther from God.”\n*****\n“Everything else will pass away,” the Master often said. “You must become \nanchored in the Infinite, where you can stand unshaken amidst the crash of breaking \nworlds.”\n*****\nMaster once told a group of devotees, “God never demands that you decide in His \nfavor. Why? Because He says, ‘If you love Me you will follow Me.’ He will try you \nto the limit, will almost seem to push you away. But the clever devotee says, ‘No, \nLord, I want Thee. There is only one thing I pray for: that Thou wilt never send me \nthe test of obliviousness to Thy presence.’”\n*****\nA man once complained to the Master that he could find no work. But the Master \nsaid, “To say you have no job is error. Shake up the whole world to find your work, \nand don’t give up until you find it.”\n*****\nMaster once reminded certain students who were blindly living on the theory and \nnot the experience that creation is a dream, “The difference between the fanatic and \nthe scientific student is this: the fanatic denies everything as a dream, but the student \n 77\n"}

Such songs, like live matches, produce the fire \nof God-contact whenever they are struck on the foundation stone of devotion.”\n*****\nLate one afternoon Master called one of the disciples, asking her to wait in the \nsmall library until he was ready to see her. It was a hot day, and she was wearing a \ndress with a stiff tight belt. To increase her comfort she unfastened the belt. When the \nMaster summoned her, it was with these words: “Gunny sack, come here!” Amused at \nher new name, the disciple hastened to greet her guru. With a twinkling smile the \nMaster said, “I called you gunny sack because I saw that you had on the brown dress, \nand your belt was hanging.” As there had been two closed doors between herself and \nthe guru, the disciple understood that he meant he had seen her with his inner vision. \n*****\nThe Master was sitting in the living room at the desert retreat one evening, \ndictating and discussing with a small group of disciples how all creation is the result \nof the Cosmic Vibration, or Holy Ghost. One of the disciples brought Master a special \nparsley drink that she had made. He took a sip and then made a face. “What’s the \nmatter with it? It tastes like rat!”\n“It is the same as I always make it, Sir, and you usually like it,” replied the \nabashed disciple.\nMaster drank a few more sips. “It tastes just if you had dragged a rat through it,” \nhe insisted. “Here, take it away.”\n 78\n"}

After another swallow he asked in a puzzled voice, “Is it a special \nmanifestation created by the Holy Ghost?”\n*****\nThis promise of the Master was directed to every person who sought his help: \n“Not one soul that comes to me in sincerity shall go away empty-handed. Those who \nare in tune with me find Him that sent me.”\n*****\nMaster’s birthday party was drawing to a close. Since there were over two hundred \nguests and disciples who wanted to receive the Master’s blessing before leaving, each \none had to wait his turn in line. One of the older disciples found herself close to the \nend of the long queue. Standing for many hours during the course of the evening had \ncaused her knees to feel wobbly. Many devotees, oblivious of all except the Master’s \nblissful presence, stopped before him for conversation and advice. The hours went by; \nthe line slowly shortened.\nWhen the older disciple’s turn came at last, the joy of being in her guru’s presence \nwas  momentarily  overshadowed  by  the  painful  prospect  of  kneeling.  As  she \napproached  the  Master,  his  beautiful  eyes,  ever  alight  with  divine  love  and \nunderstanding, looked into hers. Gently he said, “Don’t try it.”\n*****\nMaster had taken some of the disciples with him on a long tour of antique shops to \nmake inquiries about certain fixtures for one of the churches. It was 9:30 p.m. when \nhe gave the driver instructions to turn for home. None of the company had had supper \n– some had even missed lunch – and while Master was still in one of the shops they \nhad been discussing their empty stomachs.\nAfter driving only a short way in silence, the Master said, in a voice sparkling with \nfun, “Start looking for drive-ins. You all are wondering, ‘Is he going to feed us?’”\n*****\nThe individual’s influence on the universe as a whole was clearly pictured when \nthe  Master  said,  “Nature’s  calamities  are  occasioned  by  the  sum  total  of  the \nmultitudinous wrong human thoughts.

We find all the forces of nature – the earth, the sun, the wind, and water – \nworking together to yield our food. The more spiritually civilized we grow the more \nwe will control nature. The servant nature rebels and makes trouble when the master \nof the house of civilization sleeps.”\n*****\nMaster’s teachings ring with the call to action – the call to step forward and to \nsomething to right the wrongs most people deplore in speech but do little in actuality \nto correct. \n“It  is  easy  to  talk  of  universal  sympathy  and  understanding,  but  we  must \ndemonstrate it in our lives too.

Do \nnot be tempted by this Satan to forget God and your daily meditation. On the altar of \nprayer and meditation, lay your offering daily to God, and soon the Satan of bad \nhabits will have no power over you. Before your strength, his hold will weakly relax. \nThere is hidden strength within you to overcome all obstacles and temptations. Bring \nforth that indomitable power and energy!”\n*****\nMaster clarified the meaning of the path of renunciation with these words: \n“Outward  renunciation  of  sense-enjoyments  without  a  corresponding  inward \nrenunciation develops hypocrisy and a greater, though suppressed, attachment to \nmaterial life. Outward renunciation is only helpful when the inward desire for sense-\npleasures is satisfied by finding greater pleasure in God. Renunciation is not an end \nitself.

Smile \nfrom within all hours.”\n*****\nA  warning  to  every  devotee  lies  in  these  words  of  the  Master:  “Material \nentanglements, sweet and mysterious, keep us dreaming so that we forget to wake up \nbefore the dream of life vanishes into the Infinite.

Wise, \npersevering activity with unfading smiles brings sure success.”\n*****\nKnowing the value of intense, devotion-filled prayer, Master often spoke about it. \nOn one occasion he said, “Watch yourself when you pray.

Depend on God.”\n*****\nMany years ago the mother of one of the Master’s students suffered a severe \nstroke. The doctor told the family she might live only until morning. \nThe Master was in Cuba at the time, but the student mentally called on him for \nhelp. His mother lived. A few months later this student paid a visit to the Master. The \nsubject of the mother’s health was brought up. The Master commented, “Well, the \nLord has spared her life for quite some time.”\nThe student inquired if she would be with them much longer, and the Master said, \n“If she lives four months we must be satisfied.”\nJust four months later to the day she passed away. \n*****\nA student in whose home the Master was staying was faced with a serious \nfinancial problem – so serious it might have meant the loss of a fortune. He told the \nMaster about it and observed that the Master remained perfectly calm. The next day \nthe situation was corrected. \nIn thanking the Master the student remarked, “How is it, Sir, that you remain \nundisturbed under such conditions? I wish that  I  could feel the same peace and \nserenity.” \nThe Master looked at him intently and said, “Remember, the same Father who \nprotects me, protects you. He is our common Father.”\n*****\nUrging the devotee away from trust in sense testimony alone, the Master said, \n“Our senses do not tell us the whole truth – that, for instance, the electrons in a small \npencil could explode a skyscraper, or that the energy released from the electrons \nconstituting a human body could explode a part of Mt. Everest.\nIf our senses conveyed the whole truth to us, we would see the earth not as solid, \nliquid, and gaseous, but as rivers and glaciers of electrons.

The physical body with its \nethereal thoughts, the sparkling lakes, heaving oceans, sky, air, and fire – all are but \nthe vibrations of the same Cosmic Energy. \nYet the senses differentiate and tell us the delusive story that the solid hurts us, the \nliquid drowns us, the fire burns us, the sky does not hold us, and the gas chokes us.”\n*****\nMaster once defined self-control: “Self-control is a tremendous thing – a power \nlittle known in the world. When you have so much power over yourself that food \ncould be placed in your mouth and still you wouldn’t taste it, or when the mind gains \nsupreme control over sexual desire, so that it means nothing to you, that is real self-\ncontrol. \nFew people have it.

Men who imagine that the Impersonal cannot manifest in a personal form are in effect \ndenying not only Its omnipresence but also the possibility that man can commune with his Maker. \nThe Lord in the form of the Cosmic Mother appears in living tangibility before Her true bhaktas \n(devotees of a Personal God).”\nThe Lord manifests Himself before His saints in whatever form each of them holds dear. “A \ndevout Christian sees Jesus; a Hindu beholds Krishna, or the Goddess Kali, or an expanding Light if \nhis worship takes an impersonal turn.”\nHOLY GHOST:  Om  or  Aum,  the Amen, the all-pervading sound emanating from Cosmic \nVibration – the voice of all creation, or of God.

The Old Testament  prophets called  maya  by the name of Satan (lit., in Hebrew, ‘the \nadversary’). Satan or Maya is the Cosmic Magician that produces multiplicity of forms to hide the \nOne Formless Verity. The sole purpose of Satan is to divert man from Spirit to matter.
