I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the\nsaffron−colored garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the entrance of the hermitage to\ngive me welcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly\nfirm, but slender and well−formed, and his step energetic. He had chosen as his place of earthly abode the\nholy city of Puri, whither multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of every province of India, come daily on\npilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath, “Lord of the World.” It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed\nhis mortal eyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transitory state of being and passed on, knowing that his\nincarnation had been carried to a triumphant completion. I am glad, indeed, to be able to record this testimony\nto the high character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar.

MY PARENTS AND EARLY LIFE\nThe characteristic features of Indian culture have long been a search for ultimate verities and the concomitant\ndisciple−guru {FN1−2} relationship. My own path led me to a Christlike sage whose beautiful life was\nchiseled for the ages. He was one of the great masters who are India's sole remaining wealth. Emerging in\nevery generation, they have bulwarked their land against the fate of Babylon and Egypt.\nI find my earliest memories covering the anachronistic features of a previous incarnation. Clear recollections\ncame to me of a distant life, a yogi {FN1−3} amidst the Himalayan snows. These glimpses of the past, by\nsome dimensionless link, also afforded me a glimpse of the future.\nThe helpless humiliations of infancy are not banished from my mind. I was resentfully conscious of not being\nable to walk or express myself freely. Prayerful surges arose within me as I realized my bodily impotence. My\nstrong emotional life took silent form as words in many languages. Among the inward confusion of tongues,\nmy ear gradually accustomed itself to the circumambient Bengali syllables of my people. The beguiling scope\nof an infant's mind! adultly considered limited to toys and toes.\nPsychological ferment and my unresponsive body brought me to many obstinate crying−spells. I recall the\ngeneral family bewilderment at my distress. Happier memories, too, crowd in on me: my mother's caresses,\nand my first attempts at lisping phrase and toddling step. These early triumphs, usually forgotten quickly, are\nyet a natural basis of self−confidence.\nMy far−reaching memories are not unique. Many yogis are known to have retained their self−consciousness\nwithout interruption by the dramatic transition to and from “life” and “death.” If man be solely a body, its loss\nindeed places the final period to identity. But if prophets down the millenniums spake with truth, man is\nessentially of incorporeal nature. The persistent core of human egoity is only temporarily allied with sense\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nAUTHOR'S ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n3\n"}

During travels in numerous lands, I have\nlistened to early recollections from the lips of veracious men and women.\nI was born in the last decade of the nineteenth century, and passed my first eight years at Gorakhpur. This was\nmy birthplace in the United Provinces of northeastern India. We were eight children: four boys and four girls.\nI, Mukunda Lal Ghosh {FN1−4}, was the second son and the fourth child.\nFather and Mother were Bengalis, of the KSHATRIYA caste. {FN1−5} Both were blessed with saintly\nnature. Their mutual love, tranquil and dignified, never expressed itself frivolously. A perfect parental\nharmony was the calm center for the revolving tumult of eight young lives.\nFather, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, was kind, grave, at times stern. Loving him dearly, we children yet observed\na certain reverential distance. An outstanding mathematician and logician, he was guided principally by his\nintellect. But Mother was a queen of hearts, and taught us only through love. After her death, Father displayed\nmore of his inner tenderness. I noticed then that his gaze often metamorphosed into my mother's.\nIn Mother's presence we tasted our earliest bitter−sweet acquaintance with the scriptures. Tales from the\nMAHABHARATA and RAMAYANA {FN1−6} were resourcefully summoned to meet the exigencies of\ndiscipline. Instruction and chastisement went hand in hand.\nA daily gesture of respect to Father was given by Mother's dressing us carefully in the afternoons to welcome\nhim home from the office. His position was similar to that of a vice−president, in the Bengal−Nagpur\nRailway, one of India's large companies. His work involved traveling, and our family lived in several cities\nduring my childhood.\nMother held an open hand toward the needy. Father was also kindly disposed, but his respect for law and\norder extended to the budget. One fortnight Mother spent, in feeding the poor, more than Father's monthly\nincome.\n“All I ask, please, is to keep your charities within a reasonable limit.” Even a gentle rebuke from her husband\nwas grievous to Mother. She ordered a hackney carriage, not hinting to the children at any disagreement.\n“Good−by; I am going away to my mother's home.” Ancient ultimatum!\nWe broke into astounded lamentations. Our maternal uncle arrived opportunely; he whispered to Father some\nsage counsel, garnered no doubt from the ages. After Father had made a few conciliatory remarks, Mother\nhappily dismissed the cab. Thus ended the only trouble I ever noticed between my parents. But I recall a\ncharacteristic discussion.\n“Please give me ten rupees for a hapless woman who has just arrived at the house.” Mother's smile had its\nown persuasion.\n“Why ten rupees? One is enough.” Father added a justification: “When my father and grandparents died\nsuddenly, I had my first taste of poverty. My only breakfast, before walking miles to my school, was a small\nbanana. Later, at the university, I was in such need that I applied to a wealthy judge for aid of one rupee per\nmonth. He declined, remarking that even a rupee is important.”\n“How bitterly you recall the denial of that rupee!” Mother's heart had an instant logic. “Do you want this\nwoman also to remember painfully your refusal of ten rupees which she needs urgently?”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nAUTHOR'S ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n4\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 8, "text": "“You win!” With the immemorial gesture of vanquished husbands, he opened his wallet. “Here is a ten−rupee\nnote. Give it to her with my good will.”\nFather tended to first say “No” to any new proposal. His attitude toward the strange woman who so readily\nenlisted Mother's sympathy was an example of his customary caution. Aversion to instant acceptance—typical\nof the French mind in the West−is really only honoring the principle of “due reflection.” I always found\nFather reasonable and evenly balanced in his judgments. If I could bolster up my numerous requests with one\nor two good arguments, he invariably put the coveted goal within my reach, whether it were a vacation trip or\na new motorcycle.\nFather was a strict disciplinarian to his children in their early years, but his attitude toward himself was truly\nSpartan. He never visited the theater, for instance, but sought his recreation in various spiritual practices and\nin reading the BHAGAVAD GITA. {FN1−7} Shunning all luxuries, he would cling to one old pair of shoes\nuntil they were useless. His sons bought automobiles after they came into popular use, but Father was always\ncontent with the trolley car for his daily ride to the office. The accumulation of money for the sake of power\nwas alien to his nature. Once, after organizing the Calcutta Urban Bank, he refused to benefit himself by\nholding any of its shares. He had simply wished to perform a civic duty in his spare time.\nSeveral years after Father had retired on a pension, an English accountant arrived to examine the books of the\nBengal−Nagpur Railway Company. The amazed investigator discovered that Father had never applied for\noverdue bonuses.\n“He did the work of three men!” the accountant told the company. “He has rupees 125,000 (about $41,250.)\nowing to him as back compensation.” The officials presented Father with a check for this amount. He thought\nso little about it that he overlooked any mention to the family. Much later he was questioned by my youngest\nbrother Bishnu, who noticed the large deposit on a bank statement.\n“Why be elated by material profit?” Father replied. “The one who pursues a goal of evenmindedness is neither\njubilant with gain nor depressed by loss. He knows that man arrives penniless in this world, and departs\nwithout a single rupee.”\n[Illustration: MY FATHER, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, A Disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya—see father1.jpg]\nEarly in their married life, my parents became disciples of a great master, Lahiri Mahasaya of Benares. This\ncontact strengthened Father's naturally ascetical temperament. Mother made a remarkable admission to my\neldest sister Roma: “Your father and myself live together as man and wife only once a year, for the purpose of\nhaving children.”\nFather first met Lahiri Mahasaya through Abinash Babu, {FN1−8} an employee in the Gorakhpur office of\nthe Bengal−Nagpur Railway. Abinash instructed my young ears with engrossing tales of many Indian saints.\nHe invariably concluded with a tribute to the superior glories of his own guru.\n“Did you ever hear of the extraordinary circumstances under which your father became a disciple of Lahiri\nMahasaya?”\nIt was on a lazy summer afternoon, as Abinash and I sat together in the compound of my home, that he put\nthis intriguing question. I shook my head with a smile of anticipation.\n“Years ago, before you were born, I asked my superior officer−your father−to give me a week's leave from\nmy Gorakhpur duties in order to visit my guru in Benares. Your father ridiculed my plan.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nAUTHOR'S ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n5\n"}

'Concentrate on your office work if you want to\nforge ahead.'\n“Sadly walking home along a woodland path that day, I met your father in a palanquin. He dismissed his\nservants and conveyance, and fell into step beside me. Seeking to console me, he pointed out the advantages\nof striving for worldly success. But I heard him listlessly. My heart was repeating: 'Lahiri Mahasaya! I cannot\nlive without seeing you!'\n“Our path took us to the edge of a tranquil field, where the rays of the late afternoon sun were still crowning\nthe tall ripple of the wild grass. We paused in admiration. There in the field, only a few yards from us, the\nform of my great guru suddenly appeared! {FN1−9}\n“'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His voice was resonant in our astounded ears. He vanished\nas mysteriously as he had come. On my knees I was exclaiming, 'Lahiri Mahasaya! Lahiri Mahasaya!' Your\nfather was motionless with stupefaction for a few moments.\n“'Abinash, not only do I give YOU leave, but I give MYSELF leave to start for Benares tomorrow. I must\nknow this great Lahiri Mahasaya, who is able to materialize himself at will in order to intercede for you! I will\ntake my wife and ask this master to initiate us in his spiritual path. Will you guide us to him?'\n“'Of course.' Joy filled me at the miraculous answer to my prayer, and the quick, favorable turn of events.\n“The next evening your parents and I entrained for Benares. We took a horse cart the following day, and then\nhad to walk through narrow lanes to my guru's secluded home. Entering his little parlor, we bowed before the\nmaster, enlocked in his habitual lotus posture. He blinked his piercing eyes and leveled them on your father.\n“'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His words were the same as those he had used two days\nbefore in the Gorakhpur field. He added, 'I am glad that you have allowed Abinash to visit me, and that you\nand your wife have accompanied him.'\n“To their joy, he initiated your parents in the spiritual practice of KRIYA YOGA. {FN1−10} Your father and\nI, as brother disciples, have been close friends since the memorable day of the vision. Lahiri Mahasaya took a\ndefinite interest in your own birth. Your life shall surely be linked with his own: the master's blessing never\nfails.”\nLahiri Mahasaya left this world shortly after I had entered it. His picture, in an ornate frame, always graced\nour family altar in the various cities to which Father was transferred by his office. Many a morning and\nevening found Mother and me meditating before an improvised shrine, offering flowers dipped in fragrant\nsandalwood paste. With frankincense and myrrh as well as our united devotions, we honored the divinity\nwhich had found full expression in Lahiri Mahasaya.\nHis picture had a surpassing influence over my life. As I grew, the thought of the master grew with me. In\nmeditation I would often see his photographic image emerge from its small frame and, taking a living form,\nsit before me. When I attempted to touch the feet of his luminous body, it would change and again become the\npicture. As childhood slipped into boyhood, I found Lahiri Mahasaya transformed in my mind from a little\nimage, cribbed in a frame, to a living, enlightening presence. I frequently prayed to him in moments of trial or\nconfusion, finding within me his solacing direction. At first I grieved because he was no longer physically\nliving. As I began to discover his secret omnipresence, I lamented no more. He had often written to those of\nhis disciples who were over−anxious to see him: “Why come to view my bones and flesh, when I am ever\nwithin range of your KUTASTHA (spiritual sight)?”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nAUTHOR'S ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n6\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 10, "text": "I was blessed about the age of eight with a wonderful healing through the photograph of Lahiri Mahasaya.\nThis experience gave intensification to my love. While at our family estate in Ichapur, Bengal, I was stricken\nwith Asiatic cholera. My life was despaired of; the doctors could do nothing. At my bedside, Mother\nfrantically motioned me to look at Lahiri Mahasaya's picture on the wall above my head.\n“Bow to him mentally!” She knew I was too feeble even to lift my hands in salutation. “If you really show\nyour devotion and inwardly kneel before him, your life will be spared!”\nI gazed at his photograph and saw there a blinding light, enveloping my body and the entire room. My nausea\nand other uncontrollable symptoms disappeared; I was well. At once I felt strong enough to bend over and\ntouch Mother's feet in appreciation of her immeasurable faith in her guru. Mother pressed her head repeatedly\nagainst the little picture.\n“O Omnipresent Master, I thank thee that thy light hath healed my son!”\nI realized that she too had witnessed the luminous blaze through which I had instantly recovered from a\nusually fatal disease.\nOne of my most precious possessions is that same photograph. Given to Father by Lahiri Mahasaya himself, it\ncarries a holy vibration. The picture had a miraculous origin. I heard the story from Father's brother disciple,\nKali Kumar Roy.\nIt appears that the master had an aversion to being photographed. Over his protest, a group picture was once\ntaken of him and a cluster of devotees, including Kali Kumar Roy. It was an amazed photographer who\ndiscovered that the plate which had clear images of all the disciples, revealed nothing more than a blank space\nin the center where he had reasonably expected to find the outlines of Lahiri Mahasaya. The phenomenon was\nwidely discussed.\nA certain student and expert photographer, Ganga Dhar Babu, boasted that the fugitive figure would not\nescape him. The next morning, as the guru sat in lotus posture on a wooden bench with a screen behind him,\nGanga Dhar Babu arrived with his equipment. Taking every precaution for success, he greedily exposed\ntwelve plates. On each one he soon found the imprint of the wooden bench and screen, but once again the\nmaster's form was missing.\nWith tears and shattered pride, Ganga Dhar Babu sought out his guru. It was many hours before Lahiri\nMahasaya broke his silence with a pregnant comment:\n“I am Spirit. Can your camera reflect the omnipresent Invisible?”\n“I see it cannot! But, Holy Sir, I lovingly desire a picture of the bodily temple where alone, to my narrow\nvision, that Spirit appears fully to dwell.”\n“Come, then, tomorrow morning. I will pose for you.”\nAgain the photographer focused his camera. This time the sacred figure, not cloaked with mysterious\nimperceptibility, was sharp on the plate. The master never posed for another picture; at least, I have seen none.\nThe photograph is reproduced in this book. Lahiri Mahasaya's fair features, of a universal cast, hardly suggest\nto what race he belonged. His intense joy of God−communion is slightly revealed in a somewhat enigmatic\nsmile. His eyes, half open to denote a nominal direction on the outer world, are half closed also. Completely\noblivious to the poor lures of the earth, he was fully awake at all times to the spiritual problems of seekers\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nAUTHOR'S ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n7\n"}

Sitting\non my bed one morning, I fell into a deep reverie.\n“What is behind the darkness of closed eyes?” This probing thought came powerfully into my mind. An\nimmense flash of light at once manifested to my inward gaze. Divine shapes of saints, sitting in meditation\nposture in mountain caves, formed like miniature cinema pictures on the large screen of radiance within my\nforehead.\n“Who are you?” I spoke aloud.\n“We are the Himalayan yogis.” The celestial response is difficult to describe; my heart was thrilled.\n“Ah, I long to go to the Himalayas and become like you!” The vision vanished, but the silvery beams\nexpanded in ever−widening circles to infinity.\n“What is this wondrous glow?”\n“I am Iswara.{FN1−11} I am Light.” The voice was as murmuring clouds.\n“I want to be one with Thee!”\nOut of the slow dwindling of my divine ecstasy, I salvaged a permanent legacy of inspiration to seek God.\n“He is eternal, ever−new Joy!” This memory persisted long after the day of rapture.\nAnother early recollection is outstanding; and literally so, for I bear the scar to this day. My elder sister Uma\nand I were seated in the early morning under a NEEM tree in our Gorakhpur compound. She was helping me\nwith a Bengali primer, what time I could spare my gaze from the near−by parrots eating ripe margosa fruit.\nUma complained of a boil on her leg, and fetched a jar of ointment.

Shortly before the great\nday, however, I had an ominous vision.\nIt was in Bareilly on a midnight. As I slept beside Father on the piazza of our bungalow, I was awakened by a\npeculiar flutter of the mosquito netting over the bed. The flimsy curtains parted and I saw the beloved form of\nmy mother.\n“Awaken your father!” Her voice was only a whisper. “Take the first available train, at four o'clock this\nmorning. Rush to Calcutta if you would see me!” The wraithlike figure vanished.\n“Father, Father! Mother is dying!” The terror in my tone aroused him instantly. I sobbed out the fatal tidings.\n“Never mind that hallucination of yours.” Father gave his characteristic negation to a new situation. “Your\nmother is in excellent health. If we get any bad news, we shall leave tomorrow.”\n“You shall never forgive yourself for not starting now!” Anguish caused me to add bitterly, “Nor shall I ever\nforgive you!”\nThe melancholy morning came with explicit words: “Mother dangerously ill; marriage postponed; come at\nonce.”\nFather and I left distractedly.

From my inner tumult, an abrupt determination arose to hurl myself on\nthe railroad tracks. Already bereft, I felt, of my mother, I could not endure a world suddenly barren to the\nbone. I loved Mother as my dearest friend on earth. Her solacing black eyes had been my surest refuge in the\ntrifling tragedies of childhood.\n“Does she yet live?” I stopped for one last question to my uncle.\n“Of course she is alive!” He was not slow to interpret the desperation in my face. But I scarcely believed him.\nWhen we reached our Calcutta home, it was only to confront the stunning mystery of death. I collapsed into\nan almost lifeless state. Years passed before any reconciliation entered my heart. Storming the very gates of\nheaven, my cries at last summoned the Divine Mother. Her words brought final healing to my suppurating\nwounds:\n“It is I who have watched over thee, life after life, in the tenderness of many mothers!

In poetical moments, I thought that the white SHEOLI flowers were strewing\nthemselves with a willing devotion over the grassy altar.

He revealed my plan to my elder brother, who had just arrived to see\nFather. Instead of laughing lightly over this impractical scheme of a small boy, Ananta made it a definite point\nto ridicule me.\n“Where is your orange robe? You can't be a swami without that!”\nBut I was inexplicably thrilled by his words. They brought a clear picture of myself roaming about India as a\nmonk. Perhaps they awakened memories of a past life; in any case, I began to see with what natural ease I\nwould wear the garb of that anciently−founded monastic order.\nChatting one morning with Dwarka, I felt a love for God descending with avalanchic force. My companion\nwas only partly attentive to the ensuing eloquence, but I was wholeheartedly listening to myself.\nI fled that afternoon toward Naini Tal in the Himalayan foothills. Ananta gave determined chase; I was forced\nto return sadly to Bareilly. The only pilgrimage permitted me was the customary one at dawn to the SHEOLI\ntree. My heart wept for the lost Mothers, human and divine.\nThe rent left in the family fabric by Mother's death was irreparable. Father never remarried during his nearly\nforty remaining years. Assuming the difficult role of Father−Mother to his little flock, he grew noticeably\nmore tender, more approachable. With calmness and insight, he solved the various family problems. After\noffice hours he retired like a hermit to the cell of his room, practicing KRIYA YOGA in a sweet serenity.\nLong after Mother's death, I attempted to engage an English nurse to attend to details that would make my\nparent's life more comfortable.

I must not further postpone\nthe fulfillment of my solemn promise.” My brother handed me a small box, and delivered Mother's message.\n“Let these words be my final blessing, my beloved son Mukunda!” Mother had said. “The hour is here when I\nmust relate a number of phenomenal events following your birth. I first knew your destined path when you\nwere but a babe in my arms. I carried you then to the home of my guru in Benares.

Even if kept in the most secret spot,\nit shall return whence it came.'\n“I proffered alms {FN2−5} to the saint, and bowed before him in great reverence. Not taking the offering, he\ndeparted with a blessing. The next evening, as I sat with folded hands in meditation, a silver amulet\nmaterialized between my palms, even as the SADHU had promised.

Dr. Calligaris told the other professors that if certain areas on the skin are agitated,\nthe subject is given super−sensorial impressions enabling him to see objects that he could not otherwise\nperceive. To enable his subject to discern things on the other side of a wall, Professor Calligaris pressed on a\nspot to the right of the thorax for fifteen minutes. Dr. Calligaris said that if other spots of the body were\nagitated, the subjects could see objects at any distance, regardless of whether they had ever before seen those\nobjects.”.\n{FN3−3} God in His aspect of Creator; from Sanskrit root BRIH, to expand.

Stop in the lane where no one\nin my house can see you.”\nThese were my final instructions to Amar Mitter, a high school friend who planned to accompany me to the\nHimalayas. We had chosen the following day for our flight. Precautions were necessary, as Ananta exercised\na vigilant eye. He was determined to foil the plans of escape which he suspected were uppermost in my mind.\nThe amulet, like a spiritual yeast, was silently at work within me. Amidst the Himalayan snows, I hoped to\nfind the master whose face often appeared to me in visions.\nThe family was living now in Calcutta, where Father had been permanently transferred. Following the\npatriarchal Indian custom, Ananta had brought his bride to live in our home, now at 4 Gurpar Road. There in a\nsmall attic room I engaged in daily meditations and prepared my mind for the divine search.\nThe memorable morning arrived with inauspicious rain. Hearing the wheels of Amar's carriage in the road, I\nhastily tied together a blanket, a pair of sandals, Lahiri Mahasaya's picture, a copy of the BHAGAVAD GITA,\na string of prayer beads, and two loincloths. This bundle I threw from my third−story window. I ran down the\nsteps and passed my uncle, buying fish at the door.\n“What is the excitement?” His gaze roved suspiciously over my person.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 4.

Retrieving my bundle, I joined Amar with\nconspiratorial caution. We drove to Chadni Chowk, a merchandise center. For months we had been saving our\ntiffin money to buy English clothes. Knowing that my clever brother could easily play the part of a detective,\nwe thought to outwit him by European garb.\nOn the way to the station, we stopped for my cousin, Jotin Ghosh, whom I called Jatinda. He was a new\nconvert, longing for a guru in the Himalayas. He donned the new suit we had in readiness. Well−camouflaged,\nwe hoped! A deep elation possessed our hearts.\n“All we need now are canvas shoes.” I led my companions to a shop displaying rubber−soled footwear.\n“Articles of leather, gotten only through the slaughter of animals, must be absent on this holy trip.” I halted on\nthe street to remove the leather cover from my BHAGAVAD GITA, and the leather straps from my\nEnglish−made SOLA TOPEE (helmet).\nAt the station we bought tickets to Burdwan, where we planned to transfer for Hardwar in the Himalayan\nfoothills. As soon as the train, like ourselves, was in flight, I gave utterance to a few of my glorious\nanticipations.\n“Just imagine!” I ejaculated. “We shall be initiated by the masters and experience the trance of cosmic\nconsciousness. Our flesh will be charged with such magnetism that wild animals of the Himalayas will come\ntamely near us. Tigers will be no more than meek house cats awaiting our caresses!”\nThis remark−picturing a prospect I considered entrancing, both metaphorically and literally−brought an\nenthusiastic smile from Amar. But Jatinda averted his gaze, directing it through the window at the scampering\nlandscape.\n“Let the money be divided in three portions.” Jatinda broke a long silence with this suggestion. “Each of us\nshould buy his own ticket at Burdwan. Thus no one at the station will surmise that we are running away\ntogether.”\nI unsuspectingly agreed. At dusk our train stopped at Burdwan. Jatinda entered the ticket office; Amar and I\nsat on the platform. We waited fifteen minutes, then made unavailing inquiries. Searching in all directions, we\nshouted Jatinda's name with the urgency of fright. But he had faded into the dark unknown surrounding the\nlittle station.\nI was completely unnerved, shocked to a peculiar numbness. That God would countenance this depressing\nepisode! The romantic occasion of my first carefully−planned flight after Him was cruelly marred.\n“Amar, we must return home.” I was weeping like a child. “Jatinda's callous departure is an ill omen. This trip\nis doomed to failure.”\n“Is this your love for the Lord? Can't you stand the little test of a treacherous companion?”\nThrough Amar's suggestion of a divine test, my heart steadied itself. We refreshed ourselves with famous\nBurdwan sweetmeats, SITABHOG (food for the goddess) and MOTICHUR (nuggets of sweet pearl). In a few\nhours, we entrained for Hardwar, via Bareilly. Changing trains at Moghul Serai, we discussed a vital matter as\nwe waited on the platform.\n“Amar, we may soon be closely questioned by railroad officials.

Not anger but “divinest\nmelancholy” was responsible, I knew, for my unconventional behavior.\nThe official then turned to Amar. The duel of wits that followed hardly permitted me to maintain the\ncounseled stoic gravity.\n“Where is the third boy?” The man injected a full ring of authority into his voice. “Come on; speak the truth!”\n“Sir, I notice you are wearing eyeglasses. Can't you see that we are only two?” Amar smiled impudently. “I\nam not a magician; I can't conjure up a third companion.”\nThe official, noticeably disconcerted by this impertinence, sought a new field of attack.\n“What is your name?”\n“I am called Thomas. I am the son of an English mother and a converted Christian Indian father.”\n“What is your friend's name?”\n“I call him Thompson.”\nBy this time my inward mirth had reached a zenith; I unceremoniously made for the train, whistling for\ndeparture. Amar followed with the official, who was credulous and obliging enough to put us into a European\ncompartment. It evidently pained him to think of two half−English boys traveling in the section allotted to\nnatives. After his polite exit, I lay back on the seat and laughed uncontrollably. My friend wore an expression\nof blithe satisfaction at having outwitted a veteran European official.\nOn the platform I had contrived to read the telegram.

I had already boarded the train, while Amar lagged on the platform. He\nwas brought to an abrupt halt by a shout from a policeman. Our unwelcome guardian escorted us to a station\nbungalow and took charge of our money. He explained courteously that it was his duty to hold us until my\nelder brother arrived.\nLearning that the truants' destination had been the Himalayas, the officer related a strange story.\n“I see you are crazy about saints! You will never meet a greater man of God than the one I saw only\nyesterday. My brother officer and I first encountered him five days ago. We were patrolling by the Ganges, on\na sharp lookout for a certain murderer. Our instructions were to capture him, alive or dead. He was known to\nbe masquerading as a SADHU in order to rob pilgrims. A short way before us, we spied a figure which\nresembled the description of the criminal. He ignored our command to stop; we ran to overpower him.\nApproaching his back, I wielded my ax with tremendous force; the man's right arm was severed almost\ncompletely from his body.\n“Without outcry or any glance at the ghastly wound, the stranger astonishingly continued his swift pace. As\nwe jumped in front of him, he spoke quietly.\n“'I am not the murderer you are seeking.'\n“I was deeply mortified to see I had injured the person of a divine—looking sage. Prostrating myself at his\nfeet, I implored his pardon, and offered my turban−cloth to staunch the heavy spurts of blood.\n“'Son, that was just an understandable mistake on your part.' The saint regarded me kindly. 'Run along, and\ndon't reproach yourself. The Beloved Mother is taking care of me.' He pushed his dangling arm into its stump\nand lo! it adhered; the blood inexplicably ceased to flow.\n“'Come to me under yonder tree in three days and you will find me fully healed. Thus you will feel no\nremorse.'\n“Yesterday my brother officer and I went eagerly to the designated spot. The SADHU was there and allowed\nus to examine his arm. It bore no scar or trace of hurt!\n“'I am going via Rishikesh to the Himalayan solitudes.' He blessed us as he departed quickly. I feel that my\nlife has been uplifted through his sanctity.”\nThe officer concluded with a pious ejaculation; his experience had obviously moved him beyond his usual\ndepths. With an impressive gesture, he handed me a printed clipping about the miracle. In the usual garbled\nmanner of the sensational type of newspaper (not missing, alas! even in India), the reporter's version was\nslightly exaggerated: it indicated that the SADHU had been almost decapitated!\nAmar and I lamented that we had missed the great yogi who could forgive his persecutor in such a Christlike\nway. India, materially poor for the last two centuries, yet has an inexhaustible fund of divine wealth; spiritual\n“skyscrapers” may occasionally be encountered by the wayside, even by worldly men like this policeman.\nWe thanked the officer for relieving our tedium with his marvelous story. He was probably intimating that he\nwas more fortunate than we: he had met an illumined saint without effort; our earnest search had ended, not at\nthe feet of a master, but in a coarse police station!\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 4.

We can go on foot to holy Rishikesh.” I smiled encouragingly.\nBut my companion had turned pessimist as soon as the stalwart prop of our money had been taken from us.\n“If we started a trek over such dangerous jungle land, we should finish, not in the city of saints, but in the\nstomachs of tigers!”\nAnanta and Amar's brother arrived after three days. Amar greeted his relative with affectionate relief. I was\nunreconciled; Ananta got no more from me than a severe upbraiding.\n“I understand how you feel.” My brother spoke soothingly. “All I ask of you is to accompany me to Benares\nto meet a certain saint, and go on to Calcutta to visit your grieving father for a few days. Then you can resume\nyour search here for a master.”\nAmar entered the conversation at this point to disclaim any intention of returning to Hardwar with me. He was\nenjoying the familial warmth. But I knew I would never abandon the quest for my guru.\nOur party entrained for Benares. There I had a singular and instant response to my prayers.\nA clever scheme had been prearranged by Ananta. Before seeing me at Hardwar, he had stopped in Benares to\nask a certain scriptural authority to interview me later. Both the pundit and his son had promised to undertake\nmy dissuasion from the path of a SANNYASI. {FN4−1}\nAnanta took me to their home. The son, a young man of ebullient manner, greeted me in the courtyard. He\nengaged me in a lengthy philosophic discourse. Professing to have a clairvoyant knowledge of my future, he\ndiscountenanced my idea of being a monk.\n“You will meet continual misfortune, and be unable to find God, if you insist on deserting your ordinary\nresponsibilities! You cannot work out your past karma {FN4−2} without worldly experiences.”\nKrishna's immortal words rose to my lips in reply: “'Even he with the worst of karma who ceaselessly\nmeditates on Me quickly loses the effects of his past bad actions. Becoming a high−souled being, he soon\nattains perennial peace. Arjuna, know this for certain: the devotee who puts his trust in Me never perishes!'“\n{FN4−3}\nBut the forceful prognostications of the young man had slightly shaken my confidence. With all the fervor of\nmy heart I prayed silently to God:\n“Please solve my bewilderment and answer me, right here and now, if Thou dost desire me to lead the life of a\nrenunciate or a worldly man!”\nI noticed a SADHU of noble countenance standing just outside the compound of the pundit's house. Evidently\nhe had overheard the spirited conversation between the self−styled clairvoyant and myself, for the stranger\ncalled me to his side. I felt a tremendous power flowing from his calm eyes.\n“Son, don't listen to that ignoramus. In response to your prayer, the Lord tells me to assure you that your sole\npath in this life is that of the renunciate.”\nWith astonishment as well as gratitude, I smiled happily at this decisive message.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 4.

He smiled mischievously.\n“At your school, I found that Amar had left his classroom and had not returned. I went to his home the next\nmorning and unearthed a marked timetable. Amar's father was just leaving by carriage and was talking to the\ncoachman.\n“'My son will not ride with me to his school this morning. He has disappeared!' the father moaned.\n“'I heard from a brother coachman that your son and two others, dressed in European suits, boarded the train\nat Howrah Station,' the man stated. 'They made a present of their leather shoes to the cab driver.'\n“Thus I had three clues−the timetable, the trio of boys, and the English clothing.”\nI was listening to Ananta's disclosures with mingled mirth and vexation. Our generosity to the coachman had\nbeen slightly misplaced!\n“Of course I rushed to send telegrams to station officials in all the cities which Amar had underlined in the\ntimetable. He had checked Bareilly, so I wired your friend Dwarka there.

I sought him out and invited him to dinner. He accepted, quite disarmed by my\nfriendly manner. On the way I led him unsuspectingly to a police station. He was surrounded by several\nofficers whom I had previously selected for their ferocious appearance. Under their formidable gaze, Jatinda\nagreed to account for his mysterious conduct.\n“'I started for the Himalayas in a buoyant spiritual mood,' he explained. 'Inspiration filled me at the prospect\nof meeting the masters. But as soon as Mukunda said, “During our ecstasies in the Himalayan caves, tigers\nwill be spellbound and sit around us like tame pussies,” my spirits froze; beads of perspiration formed on my\nbrow. “What then?” I thought. “If the vicious nature of the tigers be not changed through the power of our\nspiritual trance, shall they treat us with the kindness of house cats?” In my mind's eye, I already saw myself\nthe compulsory inmate of some tiger's stomach−entering there not at once with the whole body, but by\ninstallments of its several parts!'“\nMy anger at Jatinda's vanishment was evaporated in laughter.

In my absence, he had lovingly hatched a plot by arranging for a saintly pundit,\nSwami Kebalananda, {FN4−5} to come regularly to the house.\n“The sage will be your Sanskrit tutor,” my parent announced confidently.\nFather hoped to satisfy my religious yearnings by instructions from a learned philosopher. But the tables were\nsubtly turned: my new teacher, far from offering intellectual aridities, fanned the embers of my\nGod−aspiration. Unknown to Father, Swami Kebalananda was an exalted disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. The\npeerless guru had possessed thousands of disciples, silently drawn to him by the irresistibility of his divine\nmagnetism. I learned later that Lahiri Mahasaya had often characterized Kebalananda as RISHI or illumined\nsage.\nLuxuriant curls framed my tutor's handsome face. His dark eyes were guileless, with the transparency of a\nchild's. All the movements of his slight body were marked by a restful deliberation. Ever gentle and loving, he\nwas firmly established in the infinite consciousness. Many of our happy hours together were spent in deep\nKRIYA meditation.\nKebalananda was a noted authority on the ancient SHASTRAS or sacred books: his erudition had earned him\nthe title of “Shastri Mahasaya,” by which he was usually addressed. But my progress in Sanskrit scholarship\nwas unnoteworthy. I sought every opportunity to forsake prosaic grammar and to talk of yoga and Lahiri\nMahasaya. My tutor obliged me one day by telling me something of his own life with the master.\n“Rarely fortunate, I was able to remain near Lahiri Mahasaya for ten years. His Benares home was my nightly\ngoal of pilgrimage. The guru was always present in a small front parlor on the first floor. As he sat in lotus\nposture on a backless wooden seat, his disciples garlanded him in a semicircle. His eyes sparkled and danced\nwith the joy of the Divine. They were ever half closed, peering through the inner telescopic orb into a sphere\nof eternal bliss. He seldom spoke at length. Occasionally his gaze would focus on a student in need of help;\nhealing words poured then like an avalanche of light.\n“An indescribable peace blossomed within me at the master's glance. I was permeated with his fragrance, as\nthough from a lotus of infinity. To be with him, even without exchanging a word for days, was experience\nwhich changed my entire being. If any invisible barrier rose in the path of my concentration, I would meditate\nat the guru's feet. There the most tenuous states came easily within my grasp. Such perceptions eluded me in\nthe presence of lesser teachers. The master was a living temple of God whose secret doors were open to all\ndisciples through devotion.\n“Lahiri Mahasaya was no bookish interpreter of the scriptures. Effortlessly he dipped into the 'divine library.'\nFoam of words and spray of thoughts gushed from the fountain of his omniscience. He had the wondrous\nclavis which unlocked the profound philosophical science embedded ages ago in the VEDAS. {FN4−6} If\nasked to explain the different planes of consciousness mentioned in the ancient texts, he would smilingly\nassent.\n“'I will undergo those states, and presently tell you what I perceive.' He was thus diametrically unlike the\nteachers who commit scripture to memory and then give forth unrealized abstractions.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 4.

The taciturn guru often gave this instruction\nto a near−by disciple. 'I will guide your thoughts, that the right interpretation be uttered.' In this way many of\nLahiri Mahasaya's perceptions came to be recorded, with voluminous commentaries by various students.\n“The master never counseled slavish belief. 'Words are only shells,' he said. 'Win conviction of God's\npresence through your own joyous contact in meditation.'\n“No matter what the disciple's problem, the guru advised KRIYA YOGA for its solution.\n“'The yogic key will not lose its efficiency when I am no longer present in the body to guide you. This\ntechnique cannot be bound, filed, and forgotten, in the manner of theoretical inspirations. Continue ceaselessly\non your path to liberation through KRIYA, whose power lies in practice.'\n“I myself consider KRIYA the most effective device of salvation through self−effort ever to be evolved in\nman's search for the Infinite.” Kebalananda concluded with this earnest testimony. “Through its use, the\nomnipotent God, hidden in all men, became visibly incarnated in the flesh of Lahiri Mahasaya and a number\nof his disciples.”\nA Christlike miracle by Lahiri Mahasaya took place in Kebalananda's presence. My saintly tutor recounted the\nstory one day, his eyes remote from the Sanskrit texts before us.\n“A blind disciple, Ramu, aroused my active pity. Should he have no light in his eyes, when he faithfully\nserved our master, in whom the Divine was fully blazing? One morning I sought to speak to Ramu, but he sat\nfor patient hours fanning the guru with a hand−made palm−leaf PUNKHA. When the devotee finally left the\nroom, I followed him.\n“'Ramu, how long have you been blind?'\n“'From my birth, sir! Never have my eyes been blessed with a glimpse of the sun.'\n“'Our omnipotent guru can help you. Please make a supplication.'\n“The following day Ramu diffidently approached Lahiri Mahasaya. The disciple felt almost ashamed to ask\nthat physical wealth be added to his spiritual superabundance.\n“'Master, the Illuminator of the cosmos is in you. I pray you to bring His light into my eyes, that I perceive the\nsun's lesser glow.'\n“'Ramu, someone has connived to put me in a difficult position. I have no healing power.'\n“'Sir, the Infinite One within you can certainly heal.'\n“'That is indeed different, Ramu. God's limit is nowhere! He who ignites the stars and the cells of flesh with\nmysterious life−effulgence can surely bring luster of vision into your eyes.'\n“The master touched Ramu's forehead at the point between the eyebrows. {FN4−7} “'Keep your mind\nconcentrated there, and frequently chant the name of the prophet Rama {FN4−8} for seven days. The splendor\nof the sun shall have a special dawn for you.'\n“Lo! in one week it was so. For the first time, Ramu beheld the fair face of nature.

By perfection of resistless surrender, the master enabled the\nPrime Healing Power to flow freely through him.\n“The numerous bodies which were spectacularly healed through Lahiri Mahasaya eventually had to feed the\nflames of cremation.

Attempting no solution, most men pay forfeit with their lives, penalty now even as\nin the days of Thebes. Here and there, a towering lonely figure never cries defeat. From the MAYA {FN5−2}\nof duality he plucks the cleaveless truth of unity.”\n“You speak with conviction, sir.”\n“I have long exercised an honest introspection, the exquisitely painful approach to wisdom. Self−scrutiny,\nrelentless observance of one's thoughts, is a stark and shattering experience. It pulverizes the stoutest ego. But\ntrue self−analysis mathematically operates to produce seers. The way of 'self−expression,' individual\nacknowledgments, results in egotists, sure of the right to their private interpretations of God and the universe.”\n“Truth humbly retires, no doubt, before such arrogant originality.” I was enjoying the discussion.\n“Man can understand no eternal verity until he has freed himself from pretensions. The human mind, bared to\na centuried slime, is teeming with repulsive life of countless world−delusions. Struggles of the battlefields\npale into insignificance here, when man first contends with inward enemies! No mortal foes these, to be\novercome by harrowing array of might! Omnipresent, unresting, pursuing man even in sleep, subtly equipped\nwith a miasmic weapon, these soldiers of ignorant lusts seek to slay us all. Thoughtless is the man who buries\nhis ideals, surrendering to the common fate. Can he seem other than impotent, wooden, ignominious?”\n“Respected Sir, have you no sympathy for the bewildered masses?”\nThe sage was silent for a moment, then answered obliquely.\n“To love both the invisible God, Repository of All Virtues, and visible man, apparently possessed of none, is\noften baffling! But ingenuity is equal to the maze. Inner research soon exposes a unity in all human minds−the\nstalwart kinship of selfish motive. In one sense at least, the brotherhood of man stands revealed. An aghast\nhumility follows this leveling discovery. It ripens into compassion for one's fellows, blind to the healing\npotencies of the soul awaiting exploration.”\n“The saints of every age, sir, have felt like yourself for the sorrows of the world.”\n“Only the shallow man loses responsiveness to the woes of others' lives, as he sinks into narrow suffering of\nhis own.” The SADHU'S austere face was noticeably softened. “The one who practices a scalpel\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 5.

Turning a corner, I ran into an old\nacquaintance−one of those long−winded fellows whose conversational powers ignore time and embrace\neternity.\n“I will let you go in a very short while, if you will tell me all that has happened during the six years of our\nseparation.”\n“What a paradox! I must leave you now.”\nBut he held me by the hand, forcing out tidbits of information. He was like a ravenous wolf, I thought in\namusement; the longer I spoke, the more hungrily he sniffed for news. Inwardly I petitioned the Goddess Kali\nto devise a graceful means of escape.\nMy companion left me abruptly. I sighed with relief and doubled my pace, dreading any relapse into the\ngarrulous fever. Hearing rapid footsteps behind me, I quickened my speed. I dared not look back. But with a\nbound, the youth rejoined me, jovially clasping my shoulder.\n“I forgot to tell you of Gandha Baba (Perfume Saint), who is gracing yonder house.” He pointed to a dwelling\na few yards distant. “Do meet him; he is interesting. You may have an unusual experience. Good−by,” and he\nactually left me.\nThe similarly worded prediction of the SADHU at Kalighat Temple flashed to my mind. Definitely intrigued,\nI entered the house and was ushered into a commodious parlor. A crowd of people were sitting, Orient−wise,\nhere and there on a thick orange−colored carpet. An awed whisper reached my ear:\n“Behold Gandha Baba on the leopard skin. He can give the natural perfume of any flower to a scentless one,\nor revive a wilted blossom, or make a person's skin exude delightful fragrance.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 5.

I thanked the wonder−worker and seated myself by one of\nhis students. He informed me that Gandha Baba, whose proper name was Vishudhananda, had learned many\nastonishing yoga secrets from a master in Tibet. The Tibetan yogi, I was assured, had attained the age of over\na thousand years.\n“His disciple Gandha Baba does not always perform his perfume−feats in the simple verbal manner you have\njust witnessed.” The student spoke with obvious pride in his master. “His procedure differs widely, to accord\nwith diversity in temperaments. He is marvelous! Many members of the Calcutta intelligentsia are among his\nfollowers.”\nI inwardly resolved not to add myself to their number. A guru too literally “marvelous” was not to my liking.\nWith polite thanks to Gandha Baba, I departed. Sauntering home, I reflected on the three varied encounters the\nday had brought forth.\nMy sister Uma met me as I entered our Gurpar Road door.\n“You are getting quite stylish, using perfumes!”\nWithout a word, I motioned her to smell my hand.\n“What an attractive rose fragrance! It is unusually strong!”\nThinking it was “strongly unusual,” I silently placed the astrally scented blossom under her nostrils.\n“Oh, I love jasmine!” She seized the flower. A ludicrous bafflement passed over her face as she repeatedly\nsniffed the odor of jasmine from a type of flower she well knew to be scentless. Her reactions disarmed my\nsuspicion that Gandha Baba had induced an auto−suggestive state whereby I alone could detect the\nfragrances.\nLater I heard from a friend, Alakananda, that the “Perfume Saint\" had a power which I wish were possessed\nby the starving millions of Asia and, today, of Europe as well.\n“I was present with a hundred other guests at Gandha Baba's home in Burdwan,” Alakananda told me. “It was\na gala occasion. Because the yogi was reputed to have the power of extracting objects out of thin air, I\nlaughingly requested him to materialize some out−of−season tangerines. Immediately the LUCHIS {FN5−4}\nwhich were present on all the banana−leaf plates became puffed up. Each of the bread−envelopes proved to\ncontain a peeled tangerine. I bit into my own with some trepidation, but found it delicious.”\nYears later I understood by inner realization how Gandha Baba accomplished his materializations. The\nmethod, alas! is beyond the reach of the world's hungry hordes.\nThe different sensory stimuli to which man reacts−tactual, visual, gustatory, auditory, and olfactory−are\nproduced by vibratory variations in electrons and protons. The vibrations in turn are regulated by “lifetrons,”\nsubtle life forces or finer−than−atomic energies intelligently charged with the five distinctive sensory\nidea−substances.\nGandha Baba, tuning himself with the cosmic force by certain yogic practices, was able to guide the lifetrons\nto rearrange their vibratory structure and objectivize the desired result. His perfume, fruit and other miracles\nwere actual materializations of mundane vibrations, and not inner sensations hypnotically produced. {FN5−5}\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 5.

I was eager to meet the saint\nwho, in his premonastic life, had caught and fought tigers with his naked hands. A boyish enthusiasm over\nsuch remarkable feats was strong within me.\nThe next day dawned wintry cold, but Chandi and I sallied forth gaily. After much vain hunting in\nBhowanipur, outside Calcutta, we arrived at the right house. The door held two iron rings, which I sounded\npiercingly. Notwithstanding the clamor, a servant approached with leisurely gait. His ironical smile implied\nthat visitors, despite their noise, were powerless to disturb the calmness of a saint's home.\nFeeling the silent rebuke, my companion and I were thankful to be invited into the parlor. Our long wait there\ncaused uncomfortable misgivings. India's unwritten law for the truth seeker is patience; a master may\npurposely make a test of one's eagerness to meet him. This psychological ruse is freely employed in the West\nby doctors and dentists!\nFinally summoned by the servant, Chandi and I entered a sleeping apartment. The famous Sohong {FN6−1}\nSwami was seated on his bed. The sight of his tremendous body affected us strangely. With bulging eyes, we\nstood speechless. We had never before seen such a chest or such football−like biceps. On an immense neck,\nthe swami's fierce yet calm face was adorned with flowing locks, beard and moustache. A hint of dovelike and\ntigerlike qualities shone in his dark eyes. He was unclothed, save for a tiger skin about his muscular waist.\nFinding our voices, my friend and I greeted the monk, expressing our admiration for his prowess in the\nextraordinary feline arena.\n“Will you not tell us, please, how it is possible to subdue with bare fists the most ferocious of jungle beasts,\nthe royal Bengals?”\n“My sons, it is nothing to me to fight tigers. I could do it today if necessary.” He gave a childlike laugh. “You\nlook upon tigers as tigers; I know them as pussycats.”\n“Swamiji, I think I could impress my subconsciousness with the thought that tigers are pussycats, but could I\nmake tigers believe it?”\n“Of course strength also is necessary! One cannot expect victory from a baby who imagines a tiger to be a\nhouse cat! Powerful hands are my sufficient weapon.”\nHe asked us to follow him to the patio, where he struck the edge of a wall. A brick crashed to the floor; the\nsky peered boldly through the gaping lost tooth of the wall. I fairly staggered in astonishment; he who can\nremove mortared bricks from a solid wall with one blow, I thought, must surely be able to displace the teeth of\ntigers!\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 6.

Thus the tiger has converted the man, in his own mind, to a state as nerveless as\nthe pussycat's.

How often I have done\njust that!”\nI was quite willing to believe that the titan before me was able to perform the tiger−pussycat metamorphosis.\nHe seemed in a didactic mood; Chandi and I listened respectfully.\n“Mind is the wielder of muscles. The force of a hammer blow depends on the energy applied; the power\nexpressed by a man's bodily instrument depends on his aggressive will and courage. The body is literally\nmanufactured and sustained by mind. Through pressure of instincts from past lives, strengths or weaknesses\npercolate gradually into human consciousness. They express as habits, which in turn ossify into a desirable or\nan undesirable body. Outward frailty has mental origin; in a vicious circle, the habit−bound body thwarts the\nmind. If the master allows himself to be commanded by a servant, the latter becomes autocratic; the mind is\nsimilarly enslaved by submitting to bodily dictation.”\nAt our entreaty, the impressive swami consented to tell us something of his own life.\n“My earliest ambition was to fight tigers. My will was mighty, but my body was feeble.”\nAn ejaculation of surprise broke from me. It appeared incredible that this man, now “with Atlantean\nshoulders, fit to bear,” could ever have known weakness.\n“It was by indomitable persistency in thoughts of health and strength that I overcame my handicap. I have\nevery reason to extol the compelling mental vigor which I found to be the real subduer of royal Bengals.”\n“Do you think, revered swami, that I could ever fight tigers?” This was the first, and the last, time that the\nbizarre ambition ever visited my mind!\n“Yes.” He was smiling. “But there are many kinds of tigers; some roam in jungles of human desires. No\nspiritual benefit accrues by knocking beasts unconscious. Rather be victor over the inner prowlers.”\n“May we hear, sir, how you changed from a tamer of wild tigers to a tamer of wild passions?”\nThe Tiger Swami fell into silence. Remoteness came into his gaze, summoning visions of bygone years. I\ndiscerned his slight mental struggle to decide whether to grant my request. Finally he smiled in acquiescence.\n“When my fame reached a zenith, it brought the intoxication of pride. I decided not only to fight tigers but to\ndisplay them in various tricks.

He had supervised the erection of a storm−proof pavilion, designed to accommodate thousands. Its\ncenter held Raja Begum in an enormous iron cage, surrounded by an outer safety room.

Scantily clad around the waist, I was otherwise unprotected by clothing. I\nopened the bolt on the door of the safety room and calmly locked it behind me. The tiger sensed blood.\nLeaping with a thunderous crash on his bars, he sent forth a fearsome welcome. The audience was hushed\nwith pitiful fear; I seemed a meek lamb before the raging beast.\n“In a trice I was within the cage; but as I slammed the door, Raja Begum was headlong upon me. My right\nhand was desperately torn. Human blood, the greatest treat a tiger can know, fell in appalling streams. The\nprophecy of the saint seemed about to be fulfilled.\n“I rallied instantly from the shock of the first serious injury I had ever received. Banishing the sight of my\ngory fingers by thrusting them beneath my waist cloth, I swung my left arm in a bone−cracking blow. The\nbeast reeled back, swirled around the rear of the cage, and sprang forward convulsively. My famous fistic\npunishment rained on his head.\n“But Raja Begum's taste of blood had acted like the maddening first sip of wine to a dipsomaniac\nlong−deprived. Punctuated by deafening roar, the brute's assaults grew in fury. My inadequate defense of only\none hand left me vulnerable before claws and fangs. But I dealt out dazing retribution. Mutually ensanguined,\nwe struggled as to the death. The cage was pandemonium, as blood splashed in all directions, and blasts of\npain and lethal lust came from the bestial throat.\n“'Shoot him!' 'Kill the tiger!' Shrieks arose from the audience. So fast did man and beast move, that a guard's\nbullet went amiss. I mustered all my will force, bellowed fiercely, and landed a final concussive blow. The\ntiger collapsed and lay quietly.\n“Like a pussycat!” I interjected.\nThe swami laughed in hearty appreciation, then continued the engrossing tale.\n“Raja Begum was vanquished at last. His royal pride was further humbled: with my lacerated hands, I\naudaciously forced open his jaws. For a dramatic moment, I held my head within the yawning deathtrap. I\nlooked around for a chain.

Under merciless blows, the treacherous animal sank into\nsemiconsciousness. This time I secured him more carefully. Slowly I left the cage.\n“I found myself in a new uproar, this time one of delight. The crowd's cheer broke as though from a single\ngigantic throat. Disastrously mauled, I had yet fulfilled the three conditions of the fight−stunning the tiger,\nbinding him with a chain, and leaving him without requiring assistance for myself. In addition, I had so\ndrastically injured and frightened the aggressive beast that he had been content to overlook the opportune\nprize of my head in his mouth!\n“After my wounds were treated, I was honored and garlanded; hundreds of gold pieces showered at my feet.\nThe whole city entered a holiday period. Endless discussions were heard on all sides about my victory over\none of the largest and most savage tigers ever seen. Raja Begum was presented to me, as promised, but I felt\nno elation. A spiritual change had entered my heart. It seemed that with my final exit from the cage I had also\nclosed the door on my worldly ambitions.\n“A woeful period followed. For six months I lay near death from blood poisoning. As soon as I was well\nenough to leave Cooch Behar, I returned to my native town.\n“'I know now that my teacher is the holy man who gave the wise warning.' I humbly made this confession to\nmy father. 'Oh, if I could only find him!' My longing was sincere, for one day the saint arrived unheralded.\n“'Enough of tiger taming.' He spoke with calm assurance. 'Come with me; I will teach you to subdue the\nbeasts of ignorance roaming in jungles of the human mind.

He has expertly mastered the various PRANAYAMAS {FN7−1} of the\nancient eightfold yoga outlined by Patanjali. {FN7−2} Once Bhaduri Mahasaya performed the BHASTRIKA\nPRANAYAMA before me with such amazing force that it seemed an actual storm had arisen in the room!\nThen he extinguished the thundering breath and remained motionless in a high state of superconsciousness.\n{FN7−3} The aura of peace after the storm was vivid beyond forgetting.”\n“I heard that the saint never leaves his home.” Upendra's tone was a trifle incredulous.\n“Indeed it is true! He has lived indoors for the past twenty years. He slightly relaxes his self−imposed rule at\nthe times of our holy festivals, when he goes as far as his front sidewalk! The beggars gather there, because\nSaint Bhaduri is known for his tender heart.”\n“How does he remain in the air, defying the law of gravitation?”\n“A yogi's body loses its grossness after use of certain PRANAYAMAS. Then it will levitate or hop about like\na leaping frog. Even saints who do not practice a formal yoga {FN7−4} have been known to levitate during a\nstate of intense devotion to God.”\n“I would like to know more of this sage. Do you attend his evening meetings?” Upendra's eyes were sparkling\nwith curiosity.\n“Yes, I go often. I am vastly entertained by the wit in his wisdom. Occasionally my prolonged laughter mars\nthe solemnity of his gatherings. The saint is not displeased, but his disciples look daggers!”\nOn my way home from school that afternoon, I passed Bhaduri Mahasaya's cloister and decided on a visit.\nThe yogi was inaccessible to the general public. A lone disciple, occupying the ground floor, guarded his\nmaster's privacy. The student was something of a martinet; he now inquired formally if I had an\n“engagement.” His guru put in an appearance just in time to save me from summary ejection.\n“Let Mukunda come when he will.” The sage's eyes twinkled. “My rule of seclusion is not for my own\ncomfort, but for that of others. Worldly people do not like the candor which shatters their delusions. Saints are\nnot only rare but disconcerting. Even in scripture, they are often found embarrassing!”\nI followed Bhaduri Mahasaya to his austere quarters on the top floor, from which he seldom stirred. Masters\noften ignore the panorama of the world's ado, out of focus till centered in the ages. The contemporaries of a\nsage are not alone those of the narrow present.\n“Maharishi, {FN7−5} you are the first yogi I have known who always stays indoors.”\n“God plants his saints sometimes in unexpected soil, lest we think we may reduce Him to a rule!”\nThe sage locked his vibrant body in the lotus posture. In his seventies, he displayed no unpleasing signs of age\nor sedentary life. Stalwart and straight, he was ideal in every respect. His face was that of a RISHI, as\ndescribed in the ancient texts. Noble−headed, abundantly bearded, he always sat firmly upright, his quiet eyes\nfixed on Omnipresence.\nThe saint and I entered the meditative state. After an hour, his gentle voice roused me.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 7. THE LEVITATING SAINT\n38\n"}

With that good−humored wit that I found so delightful in his grave nature, he\nremarked, “People in general are more fond of JALA YOGA (union with food) than of DHYANA YOGA\n(union with God).”\nHis yogic pun affected me uproariously.\n“What a laugh you have!” An affectionate gleam came into his gaze. His own face was always serious, yet\ntouched with an ecstatic smile. His large, lotus eyes held a hidden divine laughter.\n“Those letters come from far−off America.” The sage indicated several thick envelopes on a table. “I\ncorrespond with a few societies there whose members are interested in yoga. They are discovering India anew,\nwith a better sense of direction than Columbus! I am glad to help them. The knowledge of yoga is free to all\nwho will receive, like the ungarnishable daylight.\n“What RISHIS perceived as essential for human salvation need not be diluted for the West. Alike in soul\nthough diverse in outer experience, neither West nor East will flourish if some form of disciplinary yoga be\nnot practiced.”\nThe saint held me with his tranquil eyes. I did not realize that his speech was a veiled prophetic guidance. It is\nonly now, as I write these words, that I understand the full meaning in the casual intimations he often gave me\nthat someday I would carry India's teachings to America.\n[Illustration: BHADURI MAHASAYA, “The Levitating Saint” “Sir,” I inquired, “why do you not write a\nbook on yoga for the benefit of the world?” “I am training disciples,” He replied. “They and their students will\nbe living volumes, proof against the natural disintegrations of time and the unnatural interpretaations of the\ncritics.”—see badhuri.jpg]\n“Maharishi, I wish you would write a book on yoga for the benefit of the world.”\n“I am training disciples.

Bhaduri Mahasaya entered one of his\ninimitable discourses. Like a peaceful flood, he swept away the mental debris of his listeners, floating them\nGodward. His striking parables were expressed in a flawless Bengali.\nThis evening Bhaduri expounded various philosophical points connected with the life of Mirabai, a medieval\nRajputani princess who abandoned her court life to seek the company of sadhus. One great−sannyasi refused\nto receive her because she was a woman; her reply brought him humbly to her feet.\n“Tell the master,” she had said, “that I did not know there was any Male in the universe save God; are we all\nnot females before Him?” (A scriptural conception of the Lord as the only Positive Creative Principle, His\ncreation being naught but a passive MAYA.)\nMirabai composed many ecstatic songs which are still treasured in India; I translate one of them here:\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 7.

How then have I denied myself anything? I know the joy of\nsharing the treasure. Is that a sacrifice? The shortsighted worldly folk are verily the real renunciates!

Its front\ngate, I noted, was a centuried relic from a distant shrine.

Filled with awe at this stupendous\ngeneralization, it was with great hope that I announced my results before the Royal Society—results\ndemonstrated by experiments. But the physiologists present advised me to confine myself to physical\ninvestigations, in which my success had been assured, rather than encroach on their preserves. I had\nunwittingly strayed into the domain of an unfamiliar caste system and so offended its etiquette.\n“An unconscious theological bias was also present, which confounds ignorance with faith.

Indians have always arisen who, discarding the\nimmediate and absorbing prize of the hour, have sought for the realization of the highest ideals in life−not\nthrough passive renunciation, but through active struggle. The weakling who has refused the conflict,\nacquiring nothing, has had nothing to renounce. He alone who has striven and won can enrich the world by\nbestowing the fruits of his victorious experience.\n“The work already carried out in the Bose laboratory on the response of matter, and the unexpected\nrevelations in plant life, have opened out very extended regions of inquiry in physics, in physiology, in\nmedicine, in agriculture, and even in psychology. Problems hitherto regarded as insoluble have now been\nbrought within the sphere of experimental investigation.\n“But high success is not to be obtained without rigid exactitude. Hence the long battery of super−sensitive\ninstruments and apparatus of my design, which stand before you today in their cases in the entrance hall. They\ntell you of the protracted efforts to get behind the deceptive seeming into the reality that remains unseen, of\nthe continuous toil and persistence and resourcefulness called forth to overcome human limitations.

Is “patience” not indeed a synonym of India,\nconfounding Time and the historians alike?\nI visited the research center again, soon after the day of opening. The great botanist, mindful of his promise,\ntook me to his quiet laboratory.\n“I will attach the crescograph to this fern; the magnification is tremendous.

The ascent of sap is not explicable on the mechanical\ngrounds ordinarily advanced, such as capillary attraction. The phenomenon has been solved through the\ncrescograph as the activity of living cells. Peristaltic waves issue from a cylindrical tube which extends down\na tree and serves as an actual heart!

Simultaneous with the\nquivering end of the tin, the needle dramatically wrote on the chart a death−notice.\n“Bose instruments have demonstrated that metals, such as the steel used in scissors and machinery, are subject\nto fatigue, and regain efficiency by periodic rest.

Inventing an intricate instrument, the “Resonant Cardiograph,” Bose then\npursued extensive researches on innumerable Indian plants. An enormous unsuspected pharmacopoeia of\nuseful drugs was revealed. The cardiograph is constructed with an unerring accuracy by which a\none−hundredth part of a second is indicated on a graph. Resonant records measure infinitesimal pulsations in\nplant, animal and human structure.

Work done in 1938 at\nColumbia University was reported by THE NEW YORK TIMES as follows:\nIt has been determined within the past few years that when the nerves transmit messages between the brain\nand other parts of the body, tiny electrical impulses are being generated. These impulses have been measured\nby delicate galvanometers and magnified millions of times by modern amplifying apparatus. Until now no\nsatisfactory method had been found to study the passages of the impulses along the nerve fibers in living\nanimals or man because of the great speed with which these impulses travel.\nDrs. K. S. Cole and H. J. Curtis reported having discovered that the long single cells of the fresh−water plant\nnitella, used frequently in goldfish bowls, are virtually identical with those of single nerve fibers.\nFurthermore, they found that nitella fibers, on being excited, propagate electrical waves that are similar in\nevery way, except velocity, to those of the nerve fibers in animals and man. The electrical nerve impulses in\nthe plant were found to be much slower than those in animals. This discovery was therefore seized upon by\nthe Columbia workers as a means for taking slow motion pictures of the passage of the electrical impulses in\nnerves.\nThe nitella plant thus may become a sort of Rosetta stone for deciphering the closely guarded secrets close to\nthe very borderland of mind and matter.\nThe poet Rabindranath Tagore was a stalwart friend of India's idealistic scientist. To him, the sweet Bengali\nsinger addressed the following lines: {FN8−6}\n  O Hermit, call thou in the authentic words\n  Of that old hymn called SAMA; “Rise!

This issue (#28) contains over\n100 pages of a “Basic Bibliography for Indic Studies.”\n{FN8−5} The atomic structure of matter was well−known to the ancient Hindus. One of the six systems of\nIndian philosophy is VAISESIKA, from the Sanskrit root VISESAS, “atomic individuality.” One of the\nforemost VAISESIKA expounders was Aulukya, also called Kanada, “the atom−eater,” born about 2800\nyears ago.\nIn an article in EAST−WEST, April, 1934, a summary of VAISESIKA scientific knowledge was given as\nfollows: “Though the modern 'atomic theory' is generally considered a new advance of science, it was\nbrilliantly expounded long ago by Kanada, 'the atom−eater.' The Sanskrit ANUS can be properly translated as\n'atom' in the latter's literal Greek sense of 'uncut' or indivisible. Other scientific expositions of VAISESIKA\ntreatises of the B.C. era include (1) the movement of needles toward magnets, (2) the circulation of water in\nplants, (3) AKASH or ether, inert and structureless, as a basis for transmitting subtle forces, (4) the solar fire\nas the cause of all other forms of heat, (5) heat as the cause of molecular change, (6) the law of gravitation as\ncaused by the quality that inheres in earth−atoms to give them their attractive power or downward pull, (7) the\nkinetic nature of all energy; causation as always rooted in an expenditure of energy or a redistribution of\nmotion, (8) universal dissolution through the disintegration of atoms, (9) the radiation of heat and light rays,\ninfinitely small particles, darting forth in all directions with inconceivable speed (the modern 'cosmic rays'\ntheory), (10) the relativity of time and space.\n“VAISESIKA assigned the origin of the world to atoms, eternal in their nature, i.e., their ultimate\npeculiarities. These atoms were regarded as possessing an incessant vibratory motion. . . . The recent\ndiscovery that an atom is a miniature solar system would be no news to the old VAISESIKA philosophers,\nwho also reduced time to its furthest mathematical concept by describing the smallest unit of time (KALA) as\nthe period taken by an atom to traverse its own unit of space.”\n{FN8−6} Translated from the Bengali of Rabindranath Tagore, by Manmohan Ghosh, in\nVISWA−BHARATI.\nCHAPTER 9. THE BLISSFUL DEVOTEE AND HIS COSMIC ROMANCE\n“Little sir, please be seated. I am talking to my Divine Mother.”\nSilently I had entered the room in great awe. The angelic appearance of Master Mahasaya fairly dazzled me.\nWith silky white beard and large lustrous eyes, he seemed an incarnation of purity.

The bitter\nseparation of my mother's death I had thought the measure of all anguish. Now an agony at separation from\nmy Divine Mother was an indescribable torture of the spirit. I fell moaning to the floor.\n“Little sir, quiet yourself!” The saint was sympathetically distressed.\nAbandoned in some oceanic desolation, I clutched his feet as the sole raft of my rescue.\n“Holy sir, thy intercession! Ask Divine Mother if I find any favor in Her sight!”\nThis promise is one not easily bestowed; the master was constrained to silence.\nBeyond reach of doubt, I was convinced that Master Mahasaya was in intimate converse with the Universal\nMother. It was deep humiliation to realize that my eyes were blind to Her who even at this moment was\nperceptible to the faultless gaze of the saint. Shamelessly gripping his feet, deaf to his gentle remonstrances, I\nbesought him again and again for his intervening grace.\n“I will make your plea to the Beloved.” The master's capitulation came with a slow, compassionate smile.\nWhat power in those few words, that my being should know release from its stormy exile?\n“Sir, remember your pledge! I shall return soon for Her message!” Joyful anticipation rang in my voice that\nonly a moment ago had been sobbing in sorrow.\nDescending the long stairway, I was overwhelmed by memories. This house at 50 Amherst Street, now the\nresidence of Master Mahasaya, had once been my family home, scene of my mother's death. Here my human\nheart had broken for the vanished mother; and here today my spirit had been as though crucified by absence of\nthe Divine Mother. Hallowed walls, silent witness of my grievous hurts and final healing!\nMy steps were eager as I returned to my Gurpar Road home. Seeking the seclusion of my small attic, I\nremained in meditation until ten o'clock. The darkness of the warm Indian night was suddenly lit with a\nwondrous vision.\nHaloed in splendor, the Divine Mother stood before me. Her face, tenderly smiling, was beauty itself.\n“Always have I loved thee! Ever shall I love thee!”\nThe celestial tones still ringing in the air, She disappeared.\nThe sun on the following morning had hardly risen to an angle of decorum when I paid my second visit to\nMaster Mahasaya. Climbing the staircase in the house of poignant memories, I reached his fourth−floor room.\nThe knob of the closed door was wrapped around with a cloth; a hint, I felt, that the saint desired privacy. As I\nstood irresolutely on the landing, the door was opened by the master's welcoming hand. I knelt at his holy\nfeet. In a playful mood, I wore a solemn mask over my face, hiding the divine elation.\n“Sir, I have come−very early, I confess!−for your message. Did the Beloved Mother say anything about me?”\n“Mischievous little sir!”\nNot another remark would he make. Apparently my assumed gravity was unimpressive.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 9.

Do saints never speak plainly?” Perhaps I was a little provoked.\n“Must you test me?” His calm eyes were full of understanding. “Could I add a single word this morning to the\nassurance you received last night at ten o'clock from the Beautiful Mother Herself?”\nMaster Mahasaya possessed control over the flood−gates of my soul: again I plunged prostrate at his feet. But\nthis time my tears welled from a bliss, and not a pain, past bearing.\n“Think you that your devotion did not touch the Infinite Mercy? The Motherhood of God, that you have\nworshiped in forms both human and divine, could never fail to answer your forsaken cry.”\nWho was this simple saint, whose least request to the Universal Spirit met with sweet acquiescence? His role\nin the world was humble, as befitted the greatest man of humility I ever knew. In this Amherst Street house,\nMaster Mahasaya {FN9−1} conducted a small high school for boys. No words of chastisement passed his lips;\nno rule and ferule maintained his discipline. Higher mathematics indeed were taught in these modest\nclassrooms, and a chemistry of love absent from the textbooks. He spread his wisdom by spiritual contagion\nrather than impermeable precept. Consumed by an unsophisticated passion for the Divine Mother, the saint no\nmore demanded the outward forms of respect than a child.\n“I am not your guru; he shall come a little later,” he told me. “Through his guidance, your experiences of the\nDivine in terms of love and devotion shall be translated into his terms of fathomless wisdom.”\nEvery late afternoon, I betook myself to Amherst Street. I sought Master Mahasaya's divine cup, so full that\nits drops daily overflowed on my being. Never before had I bowed in utter reverence; now I felt it an\nimmeasurable privilege even to tread the same ground which Master Mahasaya sanctified.\n“Sir, please wear this champak garland I have fashioned especially for you.” I arrived one evening, holding\nmy chain of flowers. But shyly he drew away, repeatedly refusing the honor. Perceiving my hurt, he finally\nsmiled consent.\n“Since we are both devotees of the Mother, you may put the garland on this bodily temple, as offering to Her\nwho dwells within.” His vast nature lacked space in which any egotistical consideration could gain foothold.\n[Illustration: Two Brothers of Therese Neumann, I stand with them in Konnersreuth, Bavaria.—see\nnbrothers.jpg]\n[Illustration: Master Mahasaya, Ever engrossed in his blissful cosmic romance.—see mmahasaya.jpg]\n“Let us go tomorrow to the Dakshineswar Temple, forever hallowed by my guru.” Master Mahasaya was a\ndisciple of a Christlike master, Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa.\nThe four−mile journey on the following morning was taken by boat on the Ganges. We entered the\nnine−domed Temple of Kali, where the figures of the Divine Mother and Shiva rest on a burnished silver\nlotus, its thousand petals meticulously chiseled. Master Mahasaya beamed in enchantment. He was engaged in\nhis inexhaustible romance with the Beloved. As he chanted Her name, my enraptured heart seemed shattered\ninto a thousand pieces.\nWe strolled later through the sacred precincts, halting in a tamarisk grove. The manna characteristically\nexuded by this tree was symbolic of the heavenly food Master Mahasaya was bestowing. His divine\ninvocations continued. I sat rigidly motionless on the grass amid the pink feathery tamarisk flowers.\nTemporarily absent from the body, I soared in a supernal visit.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 9.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 52, "text": "This was the first of many pilgrimages to Dakshineswar with the holy teacher. From him I learned the\nsweetness of God in the aspect of Mother, or Divine Mercy. The childlike saint found little appeal in the\nFather aspect, or Divine Justice. Stern, exacting, mathematical judgment was alien to his gentle nature.\n“He can serve as an earthly prototype for the very angels of heaven!” I thought fondly, watching him one day\nat his prayers. Without a breath of censure or criticism, he surveyed the world with eyes long familiar with the\nPrimal Purity. His body, mind, speech, and actions were effortlessly harmonized with his soul's simplicity.\n“My Master told me so.” Shrinking from personal assertion, the saint ended any sage counsel with this\ninvariable tribute. So deep was his identity with Sri Ramakrishna that Master Mahasaya no longer considered\nhis thoughts as his own.\nHand in hand, the saint and I walked one evening on the block of his school. My joy was dimmed by the\narrival of a conceited acquaintance who burdened us with a lengthy discourse.\n“I see this man doesn't please you.” The saint's whisper to me was unheard by the egotist, spellbound by his\nown monologue. “I have spoken to Divine Mother about it; She realizes our sad predicament. As soon as we\nget to yonder red house, She has promised to remind him of more urgent business.”\nMy eyes were glued to the site of salvation. Reaching its red gate, the man unaccountably turned and\ndeparted, neither finishing his sentence nor saying good−by. The assaulted air was comforted with peace.\nAnother day found me walking alone near the Howrah railway station. I stood for a moment by a temple,\nsilently criticizing a small group of men with drum and cymbals who were violently reciting a chant.\n“How undevotionally they use the Lord's divine name in mechanical repetition,” I reflected. My gaze was\nastonished by the rapid approach of Master Mahasaya. “Sir, how come you here?”\nThe saint, ignoring my question, answered my thought. “Isn't it true, little sir, that the Beloved's name sounds\nsweet from all lips, ignorant or wise?” He passed his arm around me affectionately; I found myself carried on\nhis magic carpet to the Merciful Presence.\n“Would you like to see some bioscopes?” This question one afternoon from Master Mahasaya was\nmystifying; the term was then used in India to signify motion pictures. I agreed, glad to be in his company in\nany circumstances. A brisk walk brought us to the garden fronting Calcutta University. My companion\nindicated a bench near the GOLDIGHI or pond.\n“Let us sit here for a few minutes. My Master always asked me to meditate whenever I saw an expanse of\nwater. Here its placidity reminds us of the vast calmness of God. As all things can be reflected in water, so the\nwhole universe is mirrored in the lake of the Cosmic Mind. So my GURUDEVA often said.”\nSoon we entered a university hall where a lecture was in progress. It proved abysmally dull, though varied\noccasionally by lantern slide illustrations, equally uninteresting.\n“So this is the kind of bioscope the master wanted me to see!” My thought was impatient, yet I would not hurt\nthe saint by revealing boredom in my face. But he leaned toward me confidentially.\n“I see, little sir, that you don't like this bioscope. I have mentioned it to Divine Mother; She is in full\nsympathy with us both. She tells me that the electric lights will now go out, and won't be relit until we have a\nchance to leave the room.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 9.

The professor's strident voice was stilled in\nastonishment, then remarked, “The electrical system of this hall appears to be defective.” By this time, Master\nMahasaya and I were safely across the threshold. Glancing back from the corridor, I saw that the scene of our\nmartyrdom had again become illuminated.\n“Little sir, you were disappointed in that bioscope, {FN9−2} but I think you will like a different one.” The\nsaint and I were standing on the sidewalk in front of the university building. He gently slapped my chest over\nthe heart.\nA transforming silence ensued. Just as the modern “talkies” become inaudible motion pictures when the sound\napparatus goes out of order, so the Divine Hand, by some strange miracle, stifled the earthly bustle. The\npedestrians as well as the passing trolley cars, automobiles, bullock carts, and iron−wheeled hackney carriages\nwere all in noiseless transit. As though possessing an omnipresent eye, I beheld the scenes which were behind\nme, and to each side, as easily as those in front. The whole spectacle of activity in that small section of\nCalcutta passed before me without a sound. Like a glow of fire dimly seen beneath a thin coat of ashes, a\nmellow luminescence permeated the panoramic view.\nMy own body seemed nothing more than one of the many shadows, though it was motionless, while the others\nflitted mutely to and fro. Several boys, friends of mine, approached and passed on; though they had looked\ndirectly at me, it was without recognition.\nThe unique pantomime brought me an inexpressible ecstasy. I drank deep from some blissful fount. Suddenly\nmy chest received another soft blow from Master Mahasaya. The pandemonium of the world burst upon my\nunwilling ears. I staggered, as though harshly awakened from a gossamer dream. The transcendental wine\nremoved beyond my reach.\n“Little sir, I see you found the second bioscope to your liking.” The saint was smiling; I started to drop in\ngratitude on the ground before him. “You can't do that to me now; you know God is in your temple also! I\nwon't let Divine Mother touch my feet through your hands!”\nIf anyone observed the unpretentious master and myself as we walked away from the crowded pavement, the\nonlooker surely suspected us of intoxication. I felt that the falling shades of evening were sympathetically\ndrunk with God. When darkness recovered from its nightly swoon, I faced the new morning bereft of my\necstatic mood. But ever enshrined in memory is the seraphic son of Divine Mother−Master Mahasaya!\nTrying with poor words to do justice to his benignity, I wonder if Master Mahasaya, and others among the\ndeep−visioned saints whose paths crossed mine, knew that years later, in a Western land, I would be writing\nabout their lives as divine devotees. Their foreknowledge would not surprise me nor, I hope, my readers, who\nhave come thus far with me.\n{FN9−1} These are respectful titles by which he was customarily addressed. His name was Mahendra Nath\nGupta; he signed his literary works simply “M.”\n{FN9−2} The Oxford English Dictionary gives, as rare, this definition of BIOSCOPE: A view of life; that\nwhich gives such a view.\nMaster Mahasaya's choice of a word was, then, peculiarly justified.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 9.

I MEET MY MASTER, SRI YUKTESWAR\n“Faith in God can produce any miracle except one−passing an examination without study.” Distastefully I\nclosed the book I had picked up in an idle moment.\n“The writer's exception shows his complete lack of faith,” I thought. “Poor chap, he has great respect for the\nmidnight oil!”\nMy promise to Father had been that I would complete my high school studies. I cannot pretend to diligence.\nThe passing months found me less frequently in the classroom than in secluded spots along the Calcutta\nbathing GHATS. The adjoining crematory grounds, especially gruesome at night, are considered highly\nattractive by the yogi. He who would find the Deathless Essence must not be dismayed by a few unadorned\nskulls. Human inadequacy becomes clear in the gloomy abode of miscellaneous bones. My midnight vigils\nwere thus of a different nature from the scholar's.\nThe week of final examinations at the Hindu High School was fast approaching. This interrogatory period,\nlike the sepulchral haunts, inspires a well−known terror. My mind was nevertheless at peace. Braving the\nghouls, I was exhuming a knowledge not found in lecture halls. But it lacked the art of Swami Pranabananda,\nwho easily appeared in two places at one time. My educational dilemma was plainly a matter for the Infinite\nIngenuity. This was my reasoning, though to many it seems illogic. The devotee's irrationality springs from a\nthousand inexplicable demonstrations of God's instancy in trouble.\n“Hello, Mukunda! I catch hardly a glimpse of you these days!” A classmate accosted me one afternoon on\nGurpar Road.\n“Hello, Nantu! My invisibility at school has actually placed me there in a decidedly awkward position.” I\nunburdened myself under his friendly gaze.\nNantu, who was a brilliant student, laughed heartily; my predicament was not without a comic aspect.\n“You are utterly unprepared for the finals! I suppose it is up to me to help you!”\nThe simple words conveyed divine promise to my ears; with alacrity I visited my friend's home. He kindly\noutlined the solutions to various problems he considered likely to be set by the instructors.\n“These questions are the bait which will catch many trusting boys in the examination trap. Remember my\nanswers, and you will escape without injury.”\nThe night was far gone when I departed. Bursting with unseasoned erudition, I devoutly prayed it would\nremain for the next few critical days. Nantu had coached me in my various subjects but, under press of time,\nhad forgotten my course in Sanskrit. Fervently I reminded God of the oversight.\nI set out on a short walk the next morning, assimilating my new knowledge to the rhythm of swinging\nfootsteps. As I took a short cut through the weeds of a corner lot, my eye fell on a few loose printed sheets. A\ntriumphant pounce proved them to be Sanskrit verse. I sought out a pundit for aid in my stumbling\ninterpretation. His rich voice filled the air with the edgeless, honeyed beauty of the ancient tongue. {FN10−1}\n“These exceptional stanzas cannot possibly be of aid in your Sanskrit test.” The scholar dismissed them\nskeptically.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 10.

My gratitude sped to\nthe Lord, whose sole guidance I perceived in my visit to Nantu and my walk by the unhabitual route of the\ndebris−filled lot. Playfully He had given a dual expression to His timely design for my rescue.\nI came across the discarded book whose author had denied God precedence in the examination halls. I could\nnot restrain a chuckle at my own silent comment:\n“It would only add to this fellow's confusion, if I were to tell him that divine meditation among the cadavers is\na short cut to a high school diploma!”\nIn my new dignity, I was now openly planning to leave home. Together with a young friend, Jitendra\nMazumdar, {FN10−2} I decided to join a Mahamandal hermitage in Benares, and receive its spiritual\ndiscipline.\nA desolation fell over me one morning at thought of separation from my family. Since Mother's death, my\naffection had grown especially tender for my two younger brothers, Sananda and Bishnu. I rushed to my\nretreat, the little attic which had witnessed so many scenes in my turbulent SADHANA. {FN10−3} After a\ntwo−hour flood of tears, I felt singularly transformed, as by some alchemical cleanser. All attachment\n{FN10−4} disappeared; my resolution to seek God as the Friend of friends set like granite within me. I\nquickly completed my travel preparations.\n“I make one last plea.” Father was distressed as I stood before him for final blessing. “Do not forsake me and\nyour grieving brothers and sisters.”\n“Revered Father, how can I tell my love for you! But even greater is my love for the Heavenly Father, who\nhas given me the gift of a perfect father on earth. Let me go, that I someday return with a more divine\nunderstanding.”\nWith reluctant parental consent, I set out to join Jitendra, already in Benares at the hermitage. On my arrival\nthe young head swami, Dyananda, greeted me cordially. Tall and thin, of thoughtful mien, he impressed me\nfavorably. His fair face had a Buddhalike composure.\nI was pleased that my new home possessed an attic, where I managed to spend the dawn and morning hours.\nThe ashram members, knowing little of meditation practices, thought I should employ my whole time in\norganizational duties. They gave me praise for my afternoon work in their office.\n“Don't try to catch God so soon!” This ridicule from a fellow resident accompanied one of my early\ndepartures toward the attic. I went to Dyananda, busy in his small sanctum overlooking the Ganges.\n“Swamiji, {FN10−5} I don't understand what is required of me here. I am seeking direct perception of God.\nWithout Him, I cannot be satisfied with affiliation or creed or performance of good works.”\nThe orange−robed ecclesiastic gave me an affectionate pat. Staging a mock rebuke, he admonished a few\nnear−by disciples. “Don't bother Mukunda. He will learn our ways.”\nI politely concealed my doubt. The students left the room, not overly bent with their chastisement. Dyananda\nhad further words for me.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 10. I MEET MY MASTER, SRI YUKTESWAR\n52\n"}

A\nsecond injunction for your discipline concerns food. Even when you feel hunger, don't mention it.”\nWhether famishment gleamed in my eye, I knew not. That I was hungry, I knew only too well. The invariable\nhour for the first hermitage meal was twelve noon. I had been accustomed in my own home to a large\nbreakfast at nine o'clock.\nThe three−hour gap became daily more interminable. Gone were the Calcutta years when I could rebuke the\ncook for a ten−minute delay. Now I tried to control my appetite; one day I undertook a twenty−four hour fast.\nWith double zest I awaited the following midday.\n“Dyanandaji's train is late; we are not going to eat until he arrives.” Jitendra brought me this devastating news.\nAs gesture of welcome to the swami, who had been absent for two weeks, many delicacies were in readiness.\nAn appetizing aroma filled the air. Nothing else offering, what else could be swallowed except pride over\nyesterday's achievement of a fast?\n“Lord hasten the train!” The Heavenly Provider, I thought, was hardly included in the interdiction with which\nDyananda had silenced me. Divine Attention was elsewhere, however; the plodding clock covered the hours.\nDarkness was descending as our leader entered the door. My greeting was one of unfeigned joy.\n“Dyanandaji will bathe and meditate before we can serve food.” Jitendra approached me again as a bird of ill\nomen.\nI was in near−collapse. My young stomach, new to deprivation, protested with gnawing vigor. Pictures I had\nseen of famine victims passed wraithlike before me.\n“The next Benares death from starvation is due at once in this hermitage,” I thought. Impending doom averted\nat nine o'clock. Ambrosial summons! In memory that meal is vivid as one of life's perfect hours.\nIntense absorption yet permitted me to observe that Dyananda ate absent−mindedly. He was apparently above\nmy gross pleasures.\n“Swamiji, weren't you hungry?” Happily surfeited, I was alone with the leader in his study.\n“O yes! I have spent the last four days without food or drink. I never eat on trains, filled with the heterogenous\nvibrations of worldly people. Strictly I observe the SHASTRIC {FN10−6} rules for monks of my particular\norder.\n“Certain problems of our organizational work lie on my mind. Tonight at home I neglected my dinner. What's\nthe hurry? Tomorrow I'll make it a point to have a proper meal.” He laughed merrily.\nShame spread within me like a suffocation. But the past day of my torture was not easily forgotten; I ventured\na further remark.\n“Swamiji, I am puzzled. Following your instruction, suppose I never asked for food, and nobody gives me\nany. I should starve to death.”\n“Die then!” This alarming counsel split the air. “Die if you must Mukunda! Never admit that you live by the\npower of food and not by the power of God!

Gone was an age−old delusion by which bodily\nimperatives outwit the soul. There and then I tasted the Spirit's all−sufficiency. In how many strange cities, in\nmy later life of ceaseless travel, did occasion arise to prove the serviceability of this lesson in a Benares\nhermitage!\nThe sole treasure which had accompanied me from Calcutta was the SADHU'S silver amulet bequeathed to\nme by Mother. Guarding it for years, I now had it carefully hidden in my ashram room. To renew my joy in\nthe talismanic testimony, one morning I opened the locked box. The sealed covering untouched, lo! the amulet\nwas gone. Mournfully I tore open its envelope and made unmistakably sure. It had vanished, in accordance\nwith the SADHU'S prediction, into the ether whence he had summoned it.\nMy relationship with Dyananda's followers grew steadily worse. The household was alienated, hurt by my\ndetermined aloofness. My strict adherence to meditation on the very Ideal for which I had left home and all\nworldly ambitions called forth shallow criticism on all sides.\nTorn by spiritual anguish, I entered the attic one dawn, resolved to pray until answer was vouchsafed.\n“Merciful Mother of the Universe, teach me Thyself through visions, or through a guru sent by Thee!”\nThe passing hours found my sobbing pleas without response. Suddenly I felt lifted as though bodily to a\nsphere uncircumscribed.\n“Thy Master cometh today!” A divine womanly voice came from everywhere and nowhere.\nThis supernal experience was pierced by a shout from a definite locale. A young priest nicknamed Habu was\ncalling me from the downstairs kitchen.\n“Mukunda, enough of meditation! You are needed for an errand.”\nAnother day I might have replied impatiently; now I wiped my tear−swollen face and meekly obeyed the\nsummons. Together Habu and I set out for a distant market place in the Bengali section of Benares. The\nungentle Indian sun was not yet at zenith as we made our purchases in the bazaars. We pushed our way\nthrough the colorful medley of housewives, guides, priests, simply−clad widows, dignified Brahmins, and the\nubiquitous holy bulls. Passing an inconspicuous lane, I turned my head and surveyed the narrow length.\nA Christlike man in the ocher robes of a swami stood motionless at the end of the road. Instantly and anciently\nfamiliar he seemed; my gaze fed hungrily for a trice. Then doubt assailed me.\n“You are confusing this wandering monk with someone known to you,” I thought. “Dreamer, walk on.”\nAfter ten minutes, I felt heavy numbness in my feet. As though turned to stone, they were unable to carry me\nfarther. Laboriously I turned around; my feet regained normalcy. I faced the opposite direction; again the\ncurious weight oppressed me.\n“The saint is magnetically drawing me to him!” With this thought, I heaped my parcels into the arms of Habu.\nHe had been observing my erratic footwork with amazement, and now burst into laughter.\n“What ails you?

Strength mingled subtly with gentleness.\nAs we made our way to the stone balcony of a house overlooking the Ganges, he said affectionately:\n“I will give you my hermitages and all I possess.”\n“Sir, I come for wisdom and God−contact. Those are your treasure−troves I am after!”\nThe swift Indian twilight had dropped its half−curtain before my master spoke again. His eyes held\nunfathomable tenderness.\n“I give you my unconditional love.”\nPrecious words! A quarter−century elapsed before I had another auricular proof of his love. His lips were\nstrange to ardor; silence became his oceanic heart.\n“Will you give me the same unconditional love?” He gazed at me with childlike trust.\n“I will love you eternally, Gurudeva!”\n“Ordinary love is selfish, darkly rooted in desires and satisfactions. Divine love is without condition, without\nboundary, without change. The flux of the human heart is gone forever at the transfixing touch of pure love.”\nHe added humbly, “If ever you find me falling from a state of God−realization, please promise to put my head\non your lap and help to bring me back to the Cosmic Beloved we both worship.”\nHe rose then in the gathering darkness and guided me to an inner room. As we ate mangoes and almond\nsweetmeats, he unobtrusively wove into his conversation an intimate knowledge of my nature. I was\nawe−struck at the grandeur of his wisdom, exquisitely blended with an innate humility.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 10. I MEET MY MASTER, SRI YUKTESWAR\n55\n"}

By his natural, unemphatic manner, I\nunderstood that he wished no astonished ejaculations at his clairvoyance.\n“You should go back to Calcutta. Why exclude relatives from your love of humanity?”\nHis suggestion dismayed me. My family was predicting my return, though I had been unresponsive to many\npleas by letter. “Let the young bird fly in the metaphysical skies,” Ananta had remarked. “His wings will tire\nin the heavy atmosphere.

Here too the feet of Buddha,\nShankaracharya and other Yogi—Christs had blessed the soil.\n“You will come to me in four weeks.” For the first time, Sri Yukteswar's voice was stern. “Now I have told\nmy eternal affection, and have shown my happiness at finding you−that is why you disregard my request. The\nnext time we meet, you will have to reawaken my interest: I won't accept you as a disciple easily. There must\nbe complete surrender by obedience to my strict training.”\nI remained obstinately silent. My guru easily penetrated my difficulty.\n“Do you think your relatives will laugh at you?”\n“I will not return.”\n“You will return in thirty days.”\n“Never.” Bowing reverently at his feet, I departed without lightening the controversial tension. As I made my\nway in the midnight darkness, I wondered why the miraculous meeting had ended on an inharmonious note.\nThe dual scales of MAYA, that balance every joy with a grief! My young heart was not yet malleable to the\ntransforming fingers of my guru.\nThe next morning I noticed increased hostility in the attitude of the hermitage members. My days became\nspiked with invariable rudeness.

It may be that his conscience\nwas smiting him; perhaps for sending two insolvent boys to a strange city; perhaps for his own religious\nskepticism. “If by any chance or grace you pass successfully through the Brindaban ordeal, I shall ask you to\ninitiate me as your disciple.”\nThis promise had a certain irregularity, in keeping with the unconventional occasion. The eldest brother in an\nIndian family seldom bows before his juniors; he receives respect and obedience second only to a father.

Sleep was sound and sweet the\nfirst night under my guru's roof.\nSri Yukteswar chose the following morning to grant me his KRIYA YOGA initiation. The technique I had\nalready received from two disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya−Father and my tutor, Swami Kebalananda−but in\nMaster's presence I felt transforming power. At his touch, a great light broke upon my being, like glory of\ncountless suns blazing together. A flood of ineffable bliss, overwhelming my heart to an innermost core,\ncontinued during the following day. It was late that afternoon before I could bring myself to leave the\nhermitage.\n“You will return in thirty days.” As I reached my Calcutta home, the fulfillment of Master's prediction entered\nwith me. None of my relatives made the pointed remarks I had feared about the reappearance of the “soaring\nbird.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 12. YEARS IN MY MASTER'S HERMITAGE\n65\n"}

Now I have reached the harbor of my\ndivine teacher.”\n“Son, I am happy for us both.” Father and I sat together in the evening calm. “You have found your guru, as in\nmiraculous fashion I once found my own. The holy hand of Lahiri Mahasaya is guarding our lives. Your\nmaster has proved no inaccessible Himalayan saint, but one near−by. My prayers have been answered: you\nhave not in your search for God been permanently removed from my sight.”\nFather was also pleased that my formal studies would be resumed; he made suitable arrangements. I was\nenrolled the following day at the Scottish Church College in Calcutta.\nHappy months sped by. My readers have doubtless made the perspicacious surmise that I was little seen in the\ncollege classrooms. The Serampore hermitage held a lure too irresistible. Master accepted my ubiquitous\npresence without comment. To my relief, he seldom referred to the halls of learning. Though it was plain to all\nthat I was never cut out for a scholar, I managed to attain minimum passing grades from time to time.\nDaily life at the ashram flowed smoothly, infrequently varied. My guru awoke before dawn. Lying down, or\nsometimes sitting on the bed, he entered a state of SAMADHI. {FN12−4} It was simplicity itself to discover\nwhen Master had awakened: abrupt halt of stupendous snores. {FN12−5} A sigh or two; perhaps a bodily\nmovement. Then a soundless state of breathlessness: he was in deep yogic joy.\nBreakfast did not follow; first came a long walk by the Ganges. Those morning strolls with my guru−how real\nand vivid still! In the easy resurrection of memory, I often find myself by his side: the early sun is warming\nthe river. His voice rings out, rich with the authenticity of wisdom.\nA bath; then the midday meal. Its preparation, according to Master's daily directions, had been the careful task\nof young disciples. My guru was a vegetarian. Before embracing monkhood, however, he had eaten eggs and\nfish. His advice to students was to follow any simple diet which proved suited to one's constitution.\nMaster ate little; often rice, colored with turmeric or juice of beets or spinach and lightly sprinkled with\nbuffalo GHEE or melted butter. Another day he might have lentil−DHAL or CHANNA {FN12−6} curry with\nvegetables. For dessert, mangoes or oranges with rice pudding, or jackfruit juice.\nVisitors appeared in the afternoons. A steady stream poured from the world into the hermitage tranquillity.\nEveryone found in Master an equal courtesy and kindness. To a man who has realized himself as a soul, not\nthe body or the ego, the rest of humanity assumes a striking similarity of aspect.\nThe impartiality of saints is rooted in wisdom. Masters have escaped MAYA; its alternating faces of intellect\nand idiocy no longer cast an influential glance. Sri Yukteswar showed no special consideration to those who\nhappened to be powerful or accomplished; neither did he slight others for their poverty or illiteracy. He would\nlisten respectfully to words of truth from a child, and openly ignore a conceited pundit.\n[Illustration: My Master, Sri Yukteswar, Disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya—see yukteswar.jpg]\nEight o'clock was the supper hour, and sometimes found lingering guests. My guru would not excuse himself\nto eat alone; none left his ashram hungry or dissatisfied. Sri Yukteswar was never at a loss, never dismayed by\nunexpected visitors; scanty food would emerge a banquet under his resourceful direction. Yet he was\neconomical; his modest funds went far. “Be comfortable within your purse,” he often said. “Extravagance will\nbuy you discomfort.” Whether in the details of hermitage entertainment, or his building and repair work, or\nother practical concerns, Master manifested the originality of a creative spirit.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 12.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 70, "text": "Quiet evening hours often brought one of my guru's discourses, treasures against time. His every utterance\nwas measured and chiseled by wisdom. A sublime self−assurance marked his mode of expression: it was\nunique. He spoke as none other in my experience ever spoke. His thoughts were weighed in a delicate balance\nof discrimination before he permitted them an outward garb. The essence of truth, all−pervasive with even a\nphysiological aspect, came from him like a fragrant exudation of the soul. I was conscious always that I was\nin the presence of a living manifestation of God. The weight of his divinity automatically bowed my head\nbefore him.\nIf late guests detected that Sri Yukteswar was becoming engrossed with the Infinite, he quickly engaged them\nin conversation. He was incapable of striking a pose, or of flaunting his inner withdrawal. Always one with\nthe Lord, he needed no separate time for communion. A self−realized master has already left behind the\nstepping stone of meditation. “The flower falls when the fruit appears.” But saints often cling to spiritual\nforms for the encouragement of disciples.\nAs midnight approached, my guru might fall into a doze with the naturalness of a child. There was no fuss\nabout bedding. He often lay down, without even a pillow, on a narrow davenport which was the background\nfor his customary tiger−skin seat.\nA night−long philosophical discussion was not rare; any disciple could summon it by intensity of interest. I\nfelt no tiredness then, no desire for sleep; Master's living words were sufficient. “Oh, it is dawn! Let us walk\nby the Ganges.” So ended many of my periods of nocturnal edification.\nMy early months with Sri Yukteswar culminated in a useful lesson−\"How to Outwit a Mosquito.” At home\nmy family always used protective curtains at night. I was dismayed to discover that in the Serampore\nhermitage this prudent custom was honored in the breach. Yet the insects were in full residency; I was bitten\nfrom head to foot. My guru took pity on me.\n“Buy yourself a curtain, and also one for me.” He laughed and added, “If you buy only one, for yourself, all\nmosquitoes will concentrate on me!”\nI was more than thankful to comply. Every night that I spent in Serampore, my guru would ask me to arrange\nthe bedtime curtains.\nThe mosquitoes one evening were especially virulent. But Master failed to issue his usual instructions. I\nlistened nervously to the anticipatory hum of the insects. Getting into bed, I threw a propitiatory prayer in\ntheir general direction. A half hour later, I coughed pretentiously to attract my guru's attention. I thought I\nwould go mad with the bites and especially the singing drone as the mosquitoes celebrated bloodthirsty rites.\nNo responsive stir from Master; I approached him cautiously. He was not breathing. This was my first\nobservation of him in the yogic trance; it filled me with fright.\n“His heart must have failed!” I placed a mirror under his nose; no breath−vapor appeared. To make doubly\ncertain, for minutes I closed his mouth and nostrils with my fingers. His body was cold and motionless. In a\ndaze, I turned toward the door to summon help.\n“So! A budding experimentalist! My poor nose!” Master's voice was shaky with laughter. “Why don't you go\nto bed? Is the whole world going to change for you? Change yourself: be rid of the mosquito consciousness.”\nMeekly I returned to my bed. Not one insect ventured near. I realized that my guru had previously agreed to\nthe curtains only to please me; he had no fear of mosquitoes. His yogic power was such that he either could\nwill them not to bite, or could escape to an inner invulnerability.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 12. YEARS IN MY MASTER'S HERMITAGE\n67\n"}

Whether in the buzz of insects or the pervasive glare of daylight, the testimony of the\nsenses must be barred. Sound and sight come then indeed, but to worlds fairer than the banished Eden.\n{FN12−7}\nThe instructive mosquitoes served for another early lesson at the ashram. It was the gentle hour of dusk. My\nguru was matchlessly interpreting the ancient texts. At his feet, I was in perfect peace. A rude mosquito\nentered the idyl and competed for my attention. As it dug a poisonous hypodermic needle into my thigh, I\nautomatically raised an avenging hand. Reprieve from impending execution! An opportune memory came to\nme of one of Patanjali's yoga aphorisms−that on AHIMSA (harmlessness).\n“Why didn't you finish the job?”\n“Master! Do you advocate taking life?”\n“No; but the deathblow already had been struck in your mind.”\n“I don't understand.”\n“Patanjali's meaning was the removal of DESIRE to kill.” Sri Yukteswar had found my mental processes an\nopen book. “This world is inconveniently arranged for a literal practice of AHIMSA. Man may be compelled\nto exterminate harmful creatures. He is not under similar compulsion to feel anger or animosity. All forms of\nlife have equal right to the air of MAYA. The saint who uncovers the secret of creation will be in harmony\nwith its countless bewildering expressions. All men may approach that understanding who curb the inner\npassion for destruction.”\n“Guruji, should one offer himself a sacrifice rather than kill a wild beast?”\n“No; man's body is precious. It has the highest evolutionary value because of unique brain and spinal centers.\nThese enable the advanced devotee to fully grasp and express the loftiest aspects of divinity. No lower form is\nso equipped. It is true that one incurs the debt of a minor sin if he is forced to kill an animal or any living\nthing. But the VEDAS teach that wanton loss of a human body is a serious transgression against the karmic\nlaw.”\nI sighed in relief; scriptural reinforcement of one's natural instincts is not always forthcoming.\nIt so happened that I never saw Master at close quarters with a leopard or a tiger. But a deadly cobra once\nconfronted him, only to be conquered by my guru's love. This variety of snake is much feared in India, where\nit causes more than five thousand deaths annually. The dangerous encounter took place at Puri, where Sri\nYukteswar had a second hermitage, charmingly situated near the Bay of Bengal. Prafulla, a young disciple of\nlater years, was with Master on this occasion.\n“We were seated outdoors near the ashram,” Prafulla told me. “A cobra appeared near−by, a four−foot length\nof sheer terror. Its hood was angrily expanded as it raced toward us. My guru gave a welcoming chuckle, as\nthough to a child. I was beside myself with consternation to see Master engage in a rhythmical clapping of\nhands. {FN12−8} He was entertaining the dread visitor! I remained absolutely quiet, inwardly ejaculating\nwhat fervent prayers I could muster. The serpent, very close to my guru, was now motionless, seemingly\nmagnetized by his caressing attitude. The frightful hood gradually contracted; the snake slithered between\nMaster's feet and disappeared into the bushes.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 12. YEARS IN MY MASTER'S HERMITAGE\n68\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 72, "text": "“Why my guru would move his hands, and why the cobra would not strike them, were inexplicable to me\nthen,” Prafulla concluded. “I have since come to realize that my divine master is beyond fear of hurt from any\nliving creature.”\nOne afternoon during my early months at the ashram, found Sri Yukteswar's eyes fixed on me piercingly.\n“You are too thin, Mukunda.”\nHis remark struck a sensitive point. That my sunken eyes and emaciated appearance were far from my liking\nwas testified to by rows of tonics in my room at Calcutta. Nothing availed; chronic dyspepsia had pursued me\nsince childhood. My despair reached an occasional zenith when I asked myself if it were worth−while to carry\non this life with a body so unsound.\n“Medicines have limitations; the creative life−force has none. Believe that: you shall be well and strong.”\nSri Yukteswar's words aroused a conviction of personally−applicable truth which no other healer−and I had\ntried many!−had been able to summon within me.\nDay by day, behold! I waxed. Two weeks after Master's hidden blessing, I had accumulated the invigorating\nweight which eluded me in the past. My persistent stomach ailments vanished with a lifelong permanency. On\nlater occasions I witnessed my guru's instantaneous divine healings of persons suffering from ominous\ndisease−tuberculosis, diabetes, epilepsy, or paralysis. Not one could have been more grateful for his cure than\nI was at sudden freedom from my cadaverous aspect.\n“Years ago, I too was anxious to put on weight,” Sri Yukteswar told me. “During convalescence after a severe\nillness, I visited Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares.\n“'Sir, I have been very sick and lost many pounds.'\n“'I see, Yukteswar, {FN12−9} you made yourself unwell, and now you think you are thin.'\n“This reply was far from the one I had expected; my guru, however, added encouragingly:\n“'Let me see; I am sure you ought to feel better tomorrow.'\n“Taking his words as a gesture of secret healing toward my receptive mind, I was not surprised the next\nmorning at a welcome accession of strength. I sought out my master and exclaimed exultingly, 'Sir, I feel\nmuch better today.'\n“'Indeed! Today you invigorate yourself.'\n“'No, master!' I protested. 'It was you who helped me; this is the first time in weeks that I have had any\nenergy.'\n“'O yes! Your malady has been quite serious. Your body is frail yet; who can say how it will be tomorrow?'\n“The thought of possible return of my weakness brought me a shudder of cold fear. The following morning I\ncould hardly drag myself to Lahiri Mahasaya's home.\n“'Sir, I am ailing again.'\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 12. YEARS IN MY MASTER'S HERMITAGE\n69\n"}

Once more you indispose yourself.'\n“'Gurudeva, I realize now that day by day you have been ridiculing me.' My patience was exhausted. 'I don't\nunderstand why you disbelieve my truthful reports.'\n“'Really, it has been your thoughts that have made you feel alternately weak and strong.' My master looked at\nme affectionately. 'You have seen how your health has exactly followed your expectations. Thought is a force,\neven as electricity or gravitation. The human mind is a spark of the almighty consciousness of God. I could\nshow you that whatever your powerful mind believes very intensely would instantly come to pass.'\n“Knowing that Lahiri Mahasaya never spoke idly, I addressed him with great awe and gratitude: 'Master, if I\nthink I am well and have regained my former weight, shall that happen?'\n“'It is so, even at this moment.' My guru spoke gravely, his gaze concentrated on my eyes.\n“Lo! I felt an increase not alone of strength but of weight. Lahiri Mahasaya retreated into silence. After a few\nhours at his feet, I returned to my mother's home, where I stayed during my visits to Benares.\n“'My son! What is the matter? Are you swelling with dropsy?' Mother could hardly believe her eyes. My body\nwas now of the same robust dimensions it had possessed before my illness.\n“I weighed myself and found that in one day I had gained fifty pounds; they remained with me permanently.\nFriends and acquaintances who had seen my thin figure were aghast with wonderment. A number of them\nchanged their mode of life and became disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya as a result of this miracle.\n“My guru, awake in God, knew this world to be nothing but an objectivized dream of the Creator. Because he\nwas completely aware of his unity with the Divine Dreamer, Lahiri Mahasaya could materialize or\ndematerialize or make any change he wished in the cosmic vision. {FN12−10}\n“All creation is governed by law,” Sri Yukteswar concluded. “The ones which manifest in the outer universe,\ndiscoverable by scientists, are called natural laws. But there are subtler laws ruling the realms of\nconsciousness which can be known only through the inner science of yoga. The hidden spiritual planes also\nhave their natural and lawful principles of operation. It is not the physical scientist but the fully self−realized\nmaster who comprehends the true nature of matter. Thus Christ was able to restore the servant's ear after it\nhad been severed by one of the disciples.” {FN12−11}\nSri Yukteswar was a peerless interpreter of the scriptures. Many of my happiest memories are centered in his\ndiscourses. But his jeweled thoughts were not cast into ashes of heedlessness or stupidity. One restless\nmovement of my body, or my slight lapse into absent−mindedness, sufficed to put an abrupt period to\nMaster's exposition.\n“You are not here.” Master interrupted himself one afternoon with this disclosure. As usual, he was keeping\ntrack of my attention with a devastating immediacy.\n“Guruji!” My tone was a protest. “I have not stirred; my eyelids have not moved; I can repeat each word you\nhave uttered!”\n“Nevertheless you were not fully with me. Your objection forces me to remark that in your mental\nbackground you were creating three institutions. One was a sylvan retreat on a plain, another on a hilltop, a\nthird by the ocean.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 12. YEARS IN MY MASTER'S HERMITAGE\n70\n"}

I glanced at him\napologetically.\n“What can I do with such a master, who penetrates my random musings?”\n[Illustration: Main building at the Mount Washington Estates in Los Angeles, established in 1925 as\nAmerican headquarters for the Self−Realization Fellowship.—see mtwash.jpg]\n[Illustration: Self−Realization Church of All Religions, Hollywood, California.—see hollywood.jpg]\n“You have given me that right. The subtle truths I am expounding cannot be grasped without your complete\nconcentration. Unless necessary I do not invade the seclusion of others' minds. Man has the natural privilege\nof roaming secretly among his thoughts. The unbidden Lord does not enter there; neither do I venture\nintrusion.”\n“You are ever welcome, Master!”\n“Your architectural dreams will materialize later. Now is the time for study!”\nThus incidentally my guru revealed in his simple way the coming of three great events in my life. Since early\nyouth I had had enigmatic glimpses of three buildings, each in a different setting. In the exact sequence Sri\nYukteswar had indicated, these visions took ultimate form. First came my founding of a boys' yoga school on\na Ranchi plain, then my American headquarters on a Los Angeles hilltop, finally a hermitage in southern\nCalifornia by the vast Pacific.\nMaster never arrogantly asserted: “I prophesy that such and such an event shall occur!” He would rather hint:\n“Don't you think it may happen?” But his simple speech hid vatic power. There was no recanting; never did\nhis slightly veiled words prove false.\nSri Yukteswar was reserved and matter−of−fact in demeanor. There was naught of the vague or daft visionary\nabout him. His feet were firm on the earth, his head in the haven of heaven. Practical people aroused his\nadmiration. “Saintliness is not dumbness! Divine perceptions are not incapacitating!” he would say. “The\nactive expression of virtue gives rise to the keenest intelligence.”\nIn Master's life I fully discovered the cleavage between spiritual realism and the obscure mysticism that\nspuriously passes as a counterpart. My guru was reluctant to discuss the superphysical realms. His only\n“marvelous” aura was one of perfect simplicity. In conversation he avoided startling references; in action he\nwas freely expressive. Others talked of miracles but could manifest nothing; Sri Yukteswar seldom mentioned\nthe subtle laws but secretly operated them at will.\n“A man of realization does not perform any miracle until he receives an inward sanction,” Master explained.\n“God does not wish the secrets of His creation revealed promiscuously. {FN12−12} Also, every individual in\nthe world has inalienable right to his free will. A saint will not encroach upon that independence.”\nThe silence habitual to Sri Yukteswar was caused by his deep perceptions of the Infinite. No time remained\nfor the interminable “revelations” that occupy the days of teachers without self−realization. “In shallow men\nthe fish of little thoughts cause much commotion. In oceanic minds the whales of inspiration make hardly a\nruffle.” This observation from the Hindu scriptures is not without discerning humor.\nBecause of my guru's unspectacular guise, only a few of his contemporaries recognized him as a superman.\nThe popular adage: “He is a fool that cannot conceal his wisdom,” could never be applied to Sri Yukteswar.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 12.

In his life\nI perceived a godlike unity. He had not found any insuperable obstacle to mergence of human with Divine. No\nsuch barrier exists, I came to understand, save in man's spiritual unadventurousness.\nI always thrilled at the touch of Sri Yukteswar's holy feet. Yogis teach that a disciple is spiritually magnetized\nby reverent contact with a master; a subtle current is generated. The devotee's undesirable habit−mechanisms\nin the brain are often cauterized; the groove of his worldly tendencies beneficially disturbed. Momentarily at\nleast he may find the secret veils of MAYA lifting, and glimpse the reality of bliss. My whole body responded\nwith a liberating glow whenever I knelt in the Indian fashion before my guru.\n“Even when Lahiri Mahasaya was silent,” Master told me, “or when he conversed on other than strictly\nreligious topics, I discovered that nonetheless he had transmitted to me ineffable knowledge.”\nSri Yukteswar affected me similarly. If I entered the hermitage in a worried or indifferent frame of mind, my\nattitude imperceptibly changed. A healing calm descended at mere sight of my guru. Every day with him was\na new experience in joy, peace, and wisdom. Never did I find him deluded or intoxicated with greed or\nemotion or anger or any human attachment.\n“The darkness of MAYA is silently approaching. Let us hie homeward within.” With these words at dusk\nMaster constantly reminded his disciples of their need for KRIYA YOGA. A new student occasionally\nexpressed doubts regarding his own worthiness to engage in yoga practice.\n“Forget the past,” Sri Yukteswar would console him. “The vanished lives of all men are dark with many\nshames. Human conduct is ever unreliable until anchored in the Divine. Everything in future will improve if\nyou are making a spiritual effort now.”\nMaster always had young CHELAS {FN12−13} in his hermitage. Their spiritual and intellectual education\nwas his lifelong interest: even shortly before he passed on, he accepted for training two six−year−old boys and\none youth of sixteen. He directed their minds and lives with that careful discipline in which the word\n“disciple” is etymologically rooted. The ashram residents loved and revered their guru; a slight clap of his\nhands sufficed to bring them eagerly to his side. When his mood was silent and withdrawn, no one ventured to\nspeak; when his laugh rang jovially, children looked upon him as their own.\nMaster seldom asked others to render him a personal service, nor would he accept help from a student unless\nthe willingness were sincere. My guru quietly washed his clothes if the disciples overlooked that privileged\ntask. Sri Yukteswar wore the traditional ocher−colored swami robe; his laceless shoes, in accordance with\nyogi custom, were of tiger or deer skin.\nMaster spoke fluent English, French, Hindi, and Bengali; his Sanskrit was fair. He patiently instructed his\nyoung disciples by certain short cuts which he had ingeniously devised for the study of English and Sanskrit.\nMaster was cautious of his body, while withholding solicitous attachment. The Infinite, he pointed out,\nproperly manifests through physical and mental soundness. He discountenanced any extremes. A disciple\nonce started a long fast. My guru only laughed: “Why not throw the dog a bone?”\nSri Yukteswar's health was excellent; I never saw him unwell. {FN12−14} He permitted students to consult\ndoctors if it seemed advisable. His purpose was to give respect to the worldly custom: “Physicians must carry\non their work of healing through God's laws as applied to matter.” But he extolled the superiority of mental\ntherapy, and often repeated: “Wisdom is the greatest cleanser.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 12.

Give it its due; no more,” he said. “Pain and pleasure are transitory; endure\nall dualities with calmness, while trying at the same time to remove their hold. Imagination is the door\nthrough which disease as well as healing enters. Disbelieve in the reality of sickness even when you are ill; an\nunrecognized visitor will flee!”\nMaster numbered many doctors among his disciples. “Those who have ferreted out the physical laws can\neasily investigate the science of the soul,” he told them. “A subtle spiritual mechanism is hidden just behind\nthe bodily structure.” {FN12−15}\nSri Yukteswar counseled his students to be living liaisons of Western and Eastern virtues. Himself an\nexecutive Occidental in outer habits, inwardly he was the spiritual Oriental. He praised the progressive,\nresourceful and hygienic habits of the West, and the religious ideals which give a centuried halo to the East.\nDiscipline had not been unknown to me: at home Father was strict, Ananta often severe. But Sri Yukteswar's\ntraining cannot be described as other than drastic. A perfectionist, my guru was hypercritical of his disciples,\nwhether in matters of moment or in the subtle nuances of behavior.\n“Good manners without sincerity are like a beautiful dead lady,” he remarked on suitable occasion.\n“Straightforwardness without civility is like a surgeon's knife, effective but unpleasant. Candor with courtesy\nis helpful and admirable.”\nMaster was apparently satisfied with my spiritual progress, for he seldom referred to it; in other matters my\nears were no strangers to reproof. My chief offenses were absentmindedness, intermittent indulgence in sad\nmoods, non−observance of certain rules of etiquette, and occasional unmethodical ways.\n“Observe how the activities of your father Bhagabati are well−organized and balanced in every way,” my\nguru pointed out. The two disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya had met, soon after I began my pilgrimages to\nSerampore. Father and Sri Yukteswar admiringly evaluated the other's worth. Both had built an inner life of\nspiritual granite, insoluble against the ages.\nFrom transient teachers of my earlier life I had imbibed a few erroneous lessons. A CHELA, I was told, need\nnot concern himself strenuously over worldly duties; when I had neglected or carelessly performed my tasks, I\nwas not chastised. Human nature finds such instruction very easy of assimilation. Under Master's unsparing\nrod, however, I soon recovered from the agreeable delusions of irresponsibility.\n“Those who are too good for this world are adorning some other,” Sri Yukteswar remarked. “So long as you\nbreathe the free air of earth, you are under obligation to render grateful service. He alone who has fully\nmastered the breathless state {FN12−16} is freed from cosmic imperatives. I will not fail to let you know\nwhen you have attained the final perfection.”\nMy guru could never be bribed, even by love. He showed no leniency to anyone who, like myself, willingly\noffered to be his disciple. Whether Master and I were surrounded by his students or by strangers, or were\nalone together, he always spoke plainly and upbraided sharply. No trifling lapse into shallowness or\ninconsistency escaped his rebuke. This flattening treatment was hard to endure, but my resolve was to allow\nSri Yukteswar to iron out each of my psychological kinks. As he labored at this titanic transformation, I shook\nmany times under the weight of his disciplinary hammer.\n“If you don't like my words, you are at liberty to leave at any time,” Master assured me. “I want nothing from\nyou but your own improvement. Stay only if you feel benefited.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 12. YEARS IN MY MASTER'S HERMITAGE\n73\n"}

The hard core of human egotism is hardly to be\ndislodged except rudely. With its departure, the Divine finds at last an unobstructed channel. In vain It seeks\nto percolate through flinty hearts of selfishness.\nSri Yukteswar's wisdom was so penetrating that, heedless of remarks, he often replied to one's unspoken\nobservation. “What a person imagines he hears, and what the speaker has really implied, may be poles apart,”\nhe said. “Try to feel the thoughts behind the confusion of men's verbiage.”\nBut divine insight is painful to worldly ears; Master was not popular with superficial students. The wise,\nalways few in number, deeply revered him. I daresay Sri Yukteswar would have been the most soughtafter\nguru in India had his words not been so candid and so censorious.\n“I am hard on those who come for my training,” he admitted to me. “That is my way; take it or leave it. I will\nnever compromise. But you will be much kinder to your disciples; that is your way. I try to purify only in the\nfires of severity, searing beyond the average toleration. The gentle approach of love is also transfiguring. The\ninflexible and the yielding methods are equally effective if applied with wisdom.

He has further dominion in men's souls than ever Alexander dreamed of in the soil.\nFather arrived one day to pay his respects to Sri Yukteswar. My parent expected, very likely, to hear some\nwords in my praise. He was shocked to be given a long account of my imperfections. It was Master's practice\nto recount simple, negligible shortcomings with an air of portentous gravity. Father rushed to see me. “From\nyour guru's remarks I thought to find you a complete wreck!” My parent was between tears and laughter.\nThe only cause of Sri Yukteswar's displeasure at the time was that I had been trying, against his gentle hint, to\nconvert a certain man to the spiritual path.\nWith indignant speed I sought out my guru. He received me with downcast eyes, as though conscious of guilt.\nIt was the only time I ever saw the divine lion meek before me. The unique moment was savored to the full.\n“Sir, why did you judge me so mercilessly before my astounded father? Was that just?”\n“I will not do it again.” Master's tone was apologetic.\nInstantly I was disarmed. How readily the great man admitted his fault! Though he never again upset Father's\npeace of mind, Master relentlessly continued to dissect me whenever and wherever he chose.\nNew disciples often joined Sri Yukteswar in exhaustive criticism of others. Wise like the guru! Models of\nflawless discrimination! But he who takes the offensive must not be defenseless. The same carping students\nfled precipitantly as soon as Master publicly unloosed in their direction a few shafts from his analytical\nquiver.\n“Tender inner weaknesses, revolting at mild touches of censure, are like diseased parts of the body, recoiling\nbefore even delicate handling.” This was Sri Yukteswar's amused comment on the flighty ones.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 12.

Such students often complained that they did\nnot understand Sri Yukteswar.\n“Neither do you comprehend God!” I retorted on one occasion. “When a saint is clear to you, you will be\none.” Among the trillion mysteries, breathing every second the inexplicable air, who may venture to ask that\nthe fathomless nature of a master be instantly grasped?\nStudents came, and generally went. Those who craved a path of oily sympathy and comfortable recognitions\ndid not find it at the hermitage. Master offered shelter and shepherding for the aeons, but many disciples\nmiserly demanded ego−balm as well. They departed, preferring life's countless humiliations before any\nhumility. Master's blazing rays, the open penetrating sunshine of his wisdom, were too powerful for their\nspiritual sickness. They sought some lesser teacher who, shading them with flattery, permitted the fitful sleep\nof ignorance.\nDuring my early months with Master, I had experienced a sensitive fear of his reprimands. These were\nreserved, I soon saw, for disciples who had asked for his verbal vivisection. If any writhing student made a\nprotest, Sri Yukteswar would become unoffendedly silent. His words were never wrathful, but impersonal\nwith wisdom.\nMaster's insight was not for the unprepared ears of casual visitors; he seldom remarked on their defects, even\nif conspicuous. But toward students who sought his counsel, Sri Yukteswar felt a serious responsibility. Brave\nindeed is the guru who undertakes to transform the crude ore of ego−permeated humanity! A saint's courage\nroots in his compassion for the stumbling eyeless of this world.\nWhen I had abandoned underlying resentment, I found a marked decrease in my chastisement. In a very subtle\nway, Master melted into comparative clemency. In time I demolished every wall of rationalization and\nsubconscious reservation behind which the human personality generally shields itself. {FN12−17} The reward\nwas an effortless harmony with my guru. I discovered him then to be trusting, considerate, and silently loving.\nUndemonstrative, however, he bestowed no word of affection.\nMy own temperament is principally devotional. It was disconcerting at first to find that my guru, saturated\nwith JNANA but seemingly dry of BHAKTI, {FN12−18} expressed himself only in terms of cold spiritual\nmathematics. But as I tuned myself to his nature, I discovered no diminution but rather increase in my\ndevotional approach to God. A self−realized master is fully able to guide his various disciples along natural\nlines of their essential bias.\nMy relationship with Sri Yukteswar, somewhat inarticulate, nonetheless possessed all eloquence. Often I\nfound his silent signature on my thoughts, rendering speech inutile. Quietly sitting beside him, I felt his\nbounty pouring peacefully over my being.\nSri Yukteswar's impartial justice was notably demonstrated during the summer vacation of my first college\nyear. I welcomed the opportunity to spend uninterrupted months at Serampore with my guru.\n“You may be in charge of the hermitage.” Master was pleased over my enthusiastic arrival. “Your duties will\nbe the reception of guests, and supervision of the work of the other disciples.”\nKumar, a young villager from east Bengal, was accepted a fortnight later for hermitage training. Remarkably\nintelligent, he quickly won Sri Yukteswar's affection. For some unfathomable reason, Master was very lenient\nto the new resident.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 12.

Employ your own time in sweeping and cooking.” Master issued\nthese instructions after the new boy had been with us for a month.\nExalted to leadership, Kumar exercised a petty household tyranny. In silent mutiny, the other disciples\ncontinued to seek me out for daily counsel.\n“Mukunda is impossible! You made me supervisor, yet the others go to him and obey him.” Three weeks later\nKumar was complaining to our guru. I overheard him from an adjoining room.\n“That's why I assigned him to the kitchen and you to the parlor.” Sri Yukteswar's withering tones were new to\nKumar. “In this way you have come to realize that a worthy leader has the desire to serve, and not to\ndominate. You wanted Mukunda's position, but could not maintain it by merit. Return now to your earlier\nwork as cook's assistant.”\nAfter this humbling incident, Master resumed toward Kumar a former attitude of unwonted indulgence. Who\ncan solve the mystery of attraction? In Kumar our guru discovered a charming fount which did not spurt for\nthe fellow disciples. Though the new boy was obviously Sri Yukteswar's favorite, I felt no dismay. Personal\nidiosyncrasies, possessed even by masters, lend a rich complexity to the pattern of life. My nature is seldom\ncommandeered by a detail; I was seeking from Sri Yukteswar a more inaccessible benefit than an outward\npraise.\nKumar spoke venomously to me one day without reason; I was deeply hurt.\n“Your head is swelling to the bursting point!” I added a warning whose truth I felt intuitively: “Unless you\nmend your ways, someday you will be asked to leave this ashram.”\nLaughing sarcastically, Kumar repeated my remark to our guru, who had just entered the room. Fully\nexpecting to be scolded, I retired meekly to a corner.\n“Maybe Mukunda is right.” Master's reply to the boy came with unusual coldness. I escaped without\ncastigation.\nA year later, Kumar set out for a visit to his childhood home. He ignored the quiet disapproval of Sri\nYukteswar, who never authoritatively controlled his disciples' movements. On the boy's return to Serampore\nin a few months, a change was unpleasantly apparent. Gone was the stately Kumar with serenely glowing\nface. Only an undistinguished peasant stood before us, one who had lately acquired a number of evil habits.\nMaster summoned me and brokenheartedly discussed the fact that the boy was now unsuited to the monastic\nhermitage life.\n“Mukunda, I will leave it to you to instruct Kumar to leave the ashram tomorrow; I can't do it!” Tears stood in\nSri Yukteswar's eyes, but he controlled himself quickly. “The boy would never have fallen to these depths had\nhe listened to me and not gone away to mix with undesirable companions. He has rejected my protection; the\ncallous world must be his guru still.”\nKumar's departure brought me no elation; sadly I wondered how one with power to win a master's love could\never respond to cheaper allures. Enjoyment of wine and sex are rooted in the natural man, and require no\ndelicacies of perception for their appreciation. Sense wiles are comparable to the evergreen oleander, fragrant\nwith its multicolored flowers: every part of the plant is poisonous. The land of healing lies within, radiant with\nthat happiness blindly sought in a thousand misdirections. {FN12−19}\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 12. YEARS IN MY MASTER'S HERMITAGE\n76\n"}

Perceiving their soul\nequality, he showed no distinction or partiality.\n“In sleep, you do not know whether you are a man or a woman,” he said. “Just as a man, impersonating a\nwoman, does not become one, so the soul, impersonating both man and woman, has no sex. The soul is the\npure, changeless image of God.”\nSri Yukteswar never avoided or blamed women as objects of seduction. Men, he said, were also a temptation\nto women. I once inquired of my guru why a great ancient saint had called women “the door to hell.”\n“A girl must have proved very troublesome to his peace of mind in his early life,” my guru answered\ncausticly. “Otherwise he would have denounced, not woman, but some imperfection in his own self−control.”\nIf a visitor dared to relate a suggestive story in the hermitage, Master would maintain an unresponsive silence.\n“Do not allow yourself to be thrashed by the provoking whip of a beautiful face,” he told the disciples. “How\ncan sense slaves enjoy the world? Its subtle flavors escape them while they grovel in primal mud. All nice\ndiscriminations are lost to the man of elemental lusts.”\nStudents seeking to escape from the dualistic MAYA delusion received from Sri Yukteswar patient and\nunderstanding counsel.\n“Just as the purpose of eating is to satisfy hunger, not greed, so the sex instinct is designed for the propagation\nof the species according to natural law, never for the kindling of insatiable longings,” he said. “Destroy wrong\ndesires now; otherwise they will follow you after the astral body is torn from its physical casing. Even when\nthe flesh is weak, the mind should be constantly resistant. If temptation assails you with cruel force, overcome\nit by impersonal analysis and indomitable will. Every natural passion can be mastered.\n“Conserve your powers. Be like the capacious ocean, absorbing within all the tributary rivers of the senses.\nSmall yearnings are openings in the reservoir of your inner peace, permitting healing waters to be wasted in\nthe desert soil of materialism. The forceful activating impulse of wrong desire is the greatest enemy to the\nhappiness of man. Roam in the world as a lion of self−control; see that the frogs of weakness don't kick you\naround.”\nThe devotee is finally freed from all instinctive compulsions. He transforms his need for human affection into\naspiration for God alone, a love solitary because omnipresent.\nSri Yukteswar's mother lived in the Rana Mahal district of Benares where I had first visited my guru.\nGracious and kindly, she was yet a woman of very decided opinions. I stood on her balcony one day and\nwatched mother and son talking together. In his quiet, sensible way, Master was trying to convince her about\nsomething. He was apparently unsuccessful, for she shook her head with great vigor.\n“Nay, nay, my son, go away now! Your wise words are not for me! I am not your disciple!”\nSri Yukteswar backed away without further argument, like a scolded child. I was touched at his great respect\nfor his mother even in her unreasonable moods. She saw him only as her little boy, not as a sage. There was a\ncharm about the trifling incident; it supplied a sidelight on my guru's unusual nature, inwardly humble and\noutwardly unbendable.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 12.

At the death of his beloved\nmother, he cremated her body with heavenly fire which he caused to spurt from his upraised hand.\nSri Yukteswar also ignored the restrictions, in a fashion less spectacular. When his mother passed on, he\narranged the crematory services by the holy Ganges in Benares, and fed many Brahmins in conformance with\nage−old custom.\nThe SHASTRIC prohibitions were intended to help swamis overcome narrow identifications. Shankara and\nSri Yukteswar had wholly merged their beings in the Impersonal Spirit; they needed no rescue by rule.\nSometimes, too, a master purposely ignores a canon in order to uphold its principle as superior to and\nindependent of form. Thus Jesus plucked ears of corn on the day of rest. To the inevitable critics he said: “The\nsabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.” {FN12−20}\nOutside of the scriptures, seldom was a book honored by Sri Yukteswar's perusal. Yet he was invariably\nacquainted with the latest scientific discoveries and other advancements of knowledge. A brilliant\nconversationalist, he enjoyed an exchange of views on countless topics with his guests. My guru's ready wit\nand rollicking laugh enlivened every discussion. Often grave, Master was never gloomy. “To seek the Lord,\none need not disfigure his face,” he would remark. “Remember that finding God will mean the funeral of all\nsorrows.”\nAmong the philosophers, professors, lawyers and scientists who came to the hermitage, a number arrived for\ntheir first visit with the expectation of meeting an orthodox religionist.

Examine your thoughts unremittingly for twenty−four hours. Then\nwonder no longer at God's absence.”\nA celebrated pundit received a similar jolt.

The\npundit was puzzled.\n“Quotations there have been, in superabundance.” Master's words convulsed me with mirth, as I squatted in\nmy corner, at a respectful distance from the visitor. “But what original commentary can you supply, from the\nuniqueness of your particular life? What holy text have you absorbed and made your own? In what ways have\nthese timeless truths renovated your nature?

Their elevated thoughts are\ncarefully unrelated either to the crudity of outward action or to any scourging inner discipline!”\nMaster stressed on other occasions the futility of mere book learning.\n“Do not confuse understanding with a larger vocabulary,” he remarked. “Sacred writings are beneficial in\nstimulating desire for inward realization, if one stanza at a time is slowly assimilated. Continual intellectual\nstudy results in vanity and the false satisfaction of an undigested knowledge.”\nSri Yukteswar related one of his own experiences in scriptural edification. The scene was a forest hermitage in\neastern Bengal, where he observed the procedure of a renowned teacher, Dabru Ballav. His method, at once\nsimple and difficult, was common in ancient India.\nDabru Ballav had gathered his disciples around him in the sylvan solitudes. The holy BHAGAVAD GITA\nwas open before them. Steadfastly they looked at one passage for half an hour, then closed their eyes. Another\nhalf hour slipped away. The master gave a brief comment. Motionless, they meditated again for an hour.\nFinally the guru spoke.\n“Have you understood?”\n“Yes, sir.” One in the group ventured this assertion.\n“No; not fully.

The master dismissed the students, and turned to Sri\nYukteswar.\n“Do you know the BHAGAVAD GITA?”\n“No, sir, not really; though my eyes and mind have run through its pages many times.”\n“Thousands have replied to me differently!” The great sage smiled at Master in blessing. “If one busies\nhimself with an outer display of scriptural wealth, what time is left for silent inward diving after the priceless\npearls?”\nSri Yukteswar directed the study of his own disciples by the same intensive method of one−pointedness.\n“Wisdom is not assimilated with the eyes, but with the atoms,” he said. “When your conviction of a truth is\nnot merely in your brain but in your being, you may diffidently vouch for its meaning.” He discouraged any\ntendency a student might have to construe book−knowledge as a necessary step to spiritual realization.\n“The RISHIS wrote in one sentence profundities that commentating scholars busy themselves over for\ngenerations,” he remarked. “Endless literary controversy is for sluggard minds.

But he seated himself with an uncompromising air, and\ndid not rise to greet the visitor. Slightly nervous, I squatted near the door.

A university degree, in any case, is\nnot remotely related to Vedic realization. Saints are not produced in batches every semester like accountants.”\nAfter a stunned silence, the visitor laughed heartily.\n“This is my first encounter with a heavenly magistrate,” he said. Later he made a formal request, couched in\nthe legal terms which were evidently part and parcel of his being, to be accepted as a “probationary” disciple.\nMy guru personally attended to the details connected with the management of his property. Unscrupulous\npersons on various occasions attempted to secure possession of Master's ancestral land. With determination\nand even by instigating lawsuits, Sri Yukteswar outwitted every opponent. He underwent these painful\nexperiences from a desire never to be a begging guru, or a burden on his disciples.\nHis financial independence was one reason why my alarmingly outspoken Master was innocent of the\ncunnings of diplomacy.

It can explain the abnormal,\nbut not deeds that are above the normal. The latest psychology, sponsored by the French schools, has\ndiscovered a new region in man, which it terms the superconscious. In contrast to the subconscious which\nrepresents the submerged currents of our nature, it reveals the heights to which our nature can reach. Man\nrepresents a triple, not a double, personality; our conscious and subconscious being is crowned by a\nsuperconsciousness. Many years ago the English psychologist, F. W. H. Myers, suggested that 'hidden in the\ndeep of our being is a rubbish heap as well as a treasure house.'

Seized by one of the unpredictable delusions\nwhich occasionally assail the devotee, I felt a growing impatience with hermitage duties and college studies.\nA feebly extenuating circumstance is that my proposal was made when I had been only six months with Sri\nYukteswar. Not yet had I fully surveyed his towering stature.\n“Many hillmen live in the Himalayas, yet possess no God−perception.” My guru's answer came slowly and\nsimply. “Wisdom is better sought from a man of realization than from an inert mountain.”\nIgnoring Master's plain hint that he, and not a hill, was my teacher, I repeated my plea. Sri Yukteswar\nvouchsafed no reply. I took his silence for consent, a precarious interpretation readily accepted at one's\nconvenience.\nIn my Calcutta home that evening, I busied myself with travel preparations. Tying a few articles inside a\nblanket, I remembered a similar bundle, surreptitiously dropped from my attic window a few years earlier. I\nwondered if this were to be another ill−starred flight toward the Himalayas. The first time my spiritual elation\nhad been high; tonight conscience smote heavily at thought of leaving my guru.\nThe following morning I sought out Behari Pundit, my Sanskrit professor at Scottish Church College.\n“Sir, you have told me of your friendship with a great disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. Please give me his\naddress.”\n“You mean Ram Gopal Muzumdar. I call him the 'sleepless saint.' He is always awake in an ecstatic\nconsciousness. His home is at Ranbajpur, near Tarakeswar.”\nI thanked the pundit, and entrained immediately for Tarakeswar. I hoped to silence my misgivings by\nwringing a sanction from the “sleepless saint” to engage myself in lonely Himalayan meditation. Behari's\nfriend, I heard, had received illumination after many years of KRIYA YOGA practice in isolated caves.\nAt Tarakeswar I approached a famous shrine. Hindus regard it with the same veneration that Catholics give to\nthe Lourdes sanctuary in France. Innumerable healing miracles have occurred at Tarakeswar, including one\nfor a member of my family.\n“I sat in the temple there for a week,” my eldest aunt once told me. “Observing a complete fast, I prayed for\nthe recovery of your Uncle Sarada from a chronic malady. On the seventh day I found a herb materialized in\nmy hand! I made a brew from the leaves, and gave it to your uncle. His disease vanished at once, and has\nnever reappeared.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 13. THE SLEEPLESS SAINT\n83\n"}

Its circumference,\nbeginningless and endless, makes it aptly significant of the Infinite. Cosmic abstractions are not alien even to\nthe humblest Indian peasant; he has been accused by Westerners, in fact, of living on abstractions!\nMy own mood at the moment was so austere that I felt disinclined to bow before the stone symbol. God\nshould be sought, I reflected, only within the soul.\nI left the temple without genuflection and walked briskly toward the outlying village of Ranbajpur. My appeal\nto a passer−by for guidance caused him to sink into long cogitation.\n“When you come to a crossroad, turn right and keep going,” he finally pronounced oracularly.\nObeying the directions, I wended my way alongside the banks of a canal. Darkness fell; the outskirts of the\njungle village were alive with winking fireflies and the howls of near−by jackals. The moonlight was too faint\nto supply any reassurance; I stumbled on for two hours.\nWelcome clang of a cowbell! My repeated shouts eventually brought a peasant to my side.\n“I am looking for Ram Gopal Babu.”\n“No such person lives in our village.” The man's tone was surly. “You are probably a lying detective.”\nHoping to allay suspicion in his politically troubled mind, I touchingly explained my predicament. He took\nme to his home and offered a hospitable welcome.\n“Ranbajpur is far from here,” he remarked. “At the crossroad, you should have turned left, not right.”\nMy earlier informant, I thought sadly, was a distinct menace to travelers. After a relishable meal of coarse\nrice, lentil−DHAL, and curry of potatoes with raw bananas, I retired to a small hut adjoining the courtyard. In\nthe distance, villagers were singing to the loud accompaniment of MRIDANGAS {FN13−1} and cymbals.\nSleep was inconsiderable that night; I prayed deeply to be directed to the secret yogi, Ram Gopal.\nAs the first streaks of dawn penetrated the fissures of my dark room, I set out for Ranbajpur. Crossing rough\npaddy fields, I trudged over sickled stumps of the prickly plant and mounds of dried clay. An\noccasionally−met peasant would inform me, invariably, that my destination was “only a KROSHA (two\nmiles).” In six hours the sun traveled victoriously from horizon to meridian, but I began to feel that I would\never be distant from Ranbajpur by one KROSHA.\nAt midafternoon my world was still an endless paddy field. Heat pouring from the avoidless sky was bringing\nme to near−collapse. As a man approached at leisurely pace, I hardly dared utter my usual question, lest it\nsummon the monotonous: “Just a KROSHA.”\nThe stranger halted beside me. Short and slight, he was physically unimpressive save for an extraordinary pair\nof piercing dark eyes.\n“I was planning to leave Ranbajpur, but your purpose was good, so I awaited you.” He shook his finger in my\nastounded face. “Aren't you clever to think that, unannounced, you could pounce on me? That professor\nBehari had no right to give you my address.”\nConsidering that introduction of myself would be mere verbosity in the presence of this master, I stood\nspeechless, somewhat hurt at my reception. His next remark was abruptly put.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 13. THE SLEEPLESS SAINT\n84\n"}

Today, too, you have\nhad a fairly uncomfortable time of it!”\nI agreed wholeheartedly, wonder−struck that an omniscient eye hid within the unremarkable body before me.\nHealing strength emanated from the yogi; I was instantly refreshed in the scorching field.\n“The devotee inclines to think his path to God is the only way,” he said. “Yoga, through which divinity is\nfound within, is doubtless the highest road: so Lahiri Mahasaya has told us. But discovering the Lord within,\nwe soon perceive Him without. Holy shrines at Tarakeswar and elsewhere are rightly venerated as nuclear\ncenters of spiritual power.”\nThe saint's censorious attitude vanished; his eyes became compassionately soft. He patted my shoulder.\n“Young yogi, I see you are running away from your master. He has everything you need; you must return to\nhim. Mountains cannot be your guru.” Ram Gopal was repeating the same thought which Sri Yukteswar had\nexpressed at our last meeting.\n“Masters are under no cosmic compulsion to limit their residence.” My companion glanced at me quizzically.\n“The Himalayas in India and Tibet have no monopoly on saints. What one does not trouble to find within will\nnot be discovered by transporting the body hither and yon. As soon as the devotee is WILLING to go even to\nthe ends of the earth for spiritual enlightenment, his guru appears near−by.”\nI silently agreed, recalling my prayer in the Benares hermitage, followed by the meeting with Sri Yukteswar\nin a crowded lane.\n“Are you able to have a little room where you can close the door and be alone?”\n“Yes.” I reflected that this saint descended from the general to the particular with disconcerting speed.\n“That is your cave.” The yogi bestowed on me a gaze of illumination which I have never forgotten. “That is\nyour sacred mountain. That is where you will find the kingdom of God.”\nHis simple words instantaneously banished my lifelong obsession for the Himalayas. In a burning paddy field\nI awoke from the monticolous dreams of eternal snows.\n“Young sir, your divine thirst is laudable. I feel great love for you.” Ram Gopal took my hand and led me to a\nquaint hamlet. The adobe houses were covered with coconut leaves and adorned with rustic entrances.\nThe saint seated me on the umbrageous bamboo platform of his small cottage. After giving me sweetened\nlime juice and a piece of rock candy, he entered his patio and assumed the lotus posture. In about four hours I\nopened my meditative eyes and saw that the moonlit figure of the yogi was still motionless. As I was sternly\nreminding my stomach that man does not live by bread alone, Ram Gopal approached me.\n“I see you are famished; food will be ready soon.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 13.

My host courteously refused my aid in all cooking chores. “The guest is God,” a Hindu proverb, has\ncommanded devout observance from time immemorial. In my later world travels, I was charmed to see that a\nsimilar respect for visitors is manifested in rural sections of many countries. The city dweller finds the keen\nedge of hospitality blunted by superabundance of strange faces.\nThe marts of men seemed remotely dim as I squatted by the yogi in the isolation of the tiny jungle village.\nThe cottage room was mysterious with a mellow light. Ram Gopal arranged some torn blankets on the floor\nfor my bed, and seated himself on a straw mat. Overwhelmed by his spiritual magnetism, I ventured a request.\n“Sir, why don't you grant me a SAMADHI?”\n“Dear one, I would be glad to convey the divine contact, but it is not my place to do so.” The saint looked at\nme with half−closed eyes. “Your master will bestow that experience shortly. Your body is not tuned just yet.\nAs a small lamp cannot withstand excessive electrical voltage, so your nerves are unready for the cosmic\ncurrent. If I gave you the infinite ecstasy right now, you would burn as if every cell were on fire.\n“You are asking illumination from me,” the yogi continued musingly, “while I am wondering−inconsiderable\nas I am, and with the little meditation I have done−if I have succeeded in pleasing God, and what worth I may\nfind in His eyes at the final reckoning.”\n“Sir, have you not been singleheartedly seeking God for a long time?”\n“I have not done much. Behari must have told you something of my life. For twenty years I occupied a secret\ngrotto, meditating eighteen hours a day. Then I moved to a more inaccessible cave and remained there for\ntwenty−five years, entering the yoga union for twenty hours daily. I did not need sleep, for I was ever with\nGod. My body was more rested in the complete calmness of the superconsciousness than it could be by the\npartial peace of the ordinary subconscious state.\n“The muscles relax during sleep, but the heart, lungs, and circulatory system are constantly at work; they get\nno rest. In superconsciousness, the internal organs remain in a state of suspended animation, electrified by the\ncosmic energy. By such means I have found it unnecessary to sleep for years. The time will come when you\ntoo will dispense with sleep.”\n“My goodness, you have meditated for so long and yet are unsure of the Lord's favor!” I gazed at him in\nastonishment. “Then what about us poor mortals?”\n“Well, don't you see, my dear boy, that God is Eternity Itself? To assume that one can fully know Him by\nforty−five years of meditation is rather a preposterous expectation. Babaji assures us, however, that even a\nlittle meditation saves one from the dire fear of death and after−death states. Do not fix your spiritual ideal on\na small mountain, but hitch it to the star of unqualified divine attainment. If you work hard, you will get\nthere.”\nEnthralled by the prospect, I asked him for further enlightening words. He related a wondrous story of his first\nmeeting with Lahiri Mahasaya's guru, Babaji. {FN13−3} Around midnight Ram Gopal fell into silence, and I\nlay down on my blankets. Closing my eyes, I saw flashes of lightning; the vast space within me was a\nchamber of molten light. I opened my eyes and observed the same dazzling radiance.

I felt such reluctance to bid him farewell\nthat tears coursed down my cheeks.\n“I will not let you go empty−handed.” The yogi spoke tenderly. “I will do something for you.”\nHe smiled and looked at me steadfastly. I stood rooted to the ground, peace rushing like a mighty flood\nthrough the gates of my eyes. I was instantaneously healed of a pain in my back, which had troubled me\nintermittently for years. Renewed, bathed in a sea of luminous joy, I wept no more. After touching the saint's\nfeet, I sauntered into the jungle, making my way through its tropical tangle until I reached Tarakeswar.\nThere I made a second pilgrimage to the famous shrine, and prostrated myself fully before the altar.

Wrath springs only from thwarted desires. I do not expect anything from others, so their\nactions cannot be in opposition to wishes of mine. I would not use you for my own ends; I am happy only in\nyour own true happiness.”\n“Sir, one hears of divine love in a vague way, but for the first time I am having a concrete example in your\nangelic self! In the world, even a father does not easily forgive his son if he leaves his parent's business\nwithout warning. But you show not the slightest vexation, though you must have been put to great\ninconvenience by the many unfinished tasks I left behind.”\nWe looked into each other's eyes, where tears were shining.

I planned to meditate, but my laudable\npurpose was unshared by disobedient thoughts. They scattered like birds before the hunter.\n“Mukunda!” Sri Yukteswar's voice sounded from a distant inner balcony.\nI felt as rebellious as my thoughts. “Master always urges me to meditate,” I muttered to myself. “He should\nnot disturb me when he knows why I came to his room.”\nHe summoned me again; I remained obstinately silent. The third time his tone held rebuke.\n“Sir, I am meditating,” I shouted protestingly.\n“I know how you are meditating,” my guru called out, “with your mind distributed like leaves in a storm!\nCome here to me.”\nSnubbed and exposed, I made my way sadly to his side.\n“Poor boy, the mountains couldn't give what you wanted.” Master spoke caressively, comfortingly. His calm\ngaze was unfathomable. “Your heart's desire shall be fulfilled.”\nSri Yukteswar seldom indulged in riddles; I was bewildered. He struck gently on my chest above the heart.\nMy body became immovably rooted; breath was drawn out of my lungs as if by some huge magnet. Soul and\nmind instantly lost their physical bondage, and streamed out like a fluid piercing light from my every pore.\nThe flesh was as though dead, yet in my intense awareness I knew that never before had I been fully alive. My\nsense of identity was no longer narrowly confined to a body, but embraced the circumambient atoms. People\non distant streets seemed to be moving gently over my own remote periphery. The roots of plants and trees\nappeared through a dim transparency of the soil; I discerned the inward flow of their sap.\nThe whole vicinity lay bare before me. My ordinary frontal vision was now changed to a vast spherical sight,\nsimultaneously all−perceptive.

The entire cosmos, gently luminous,\nlike a city seen afar at night, glimmered within the infinitude of my being. The sharply etched global outlines\nfaded somewhat at the farthest edges; there I could see a mellow radiance, ever−undiminished. It was\nindescribably subtle; the planetary pictures were formed of a grosser light.\nThe divine dispersion of rays poured from an Eternal Source, blazing into galaxies, transfigured with ineffable\nauras. Again and again I saw the creative beams condense into constellations, then resolve into sheets of\ntransparent flame.

The creative voice of God I heard resounding as AUM,\n{FN14−1} the vibration of the Cosmic Motor.\nSuddenly the breath returned to my lungs. With a disappointment almost unbearable, I realized that my\ninfinite immensity was lost. Once more I was limited to the humiliating cage of a body, not easily\naccommodative to the Spirit. Like a prodigal child, I had run away from my macrocosmic home and\nimprisoned myself in a narrow microcosm.\nMy guru was standing motionless before me; I started to drop at his holy feet in gratitude for the experience in\ncosmic consciousness which I had long passionately sought. He held me upright, and spoke calmly,\nunpretentiously.\n“You must not get overdrunk with ecstasy. Much work yet remains for you in the world. Come; let us sweep\nthe balcony floor; then we shall walk by the Ganges.”\nI fetched a broom; Master, I knew, was teaching me the secret of balanced living.

I saw our bodies as two astral pictures, moving over a road by the river\nwhose essence was sheer light.\n“It is the Spirit of God that actively sustains every form and force in the universe; yet He is transcendental and\naloof in the blissful uncreated void beyond the worlds of vibratory phenomena,” {FN14−2} Master explained.\n“Saints who realize their divinity even while in the flesh know a similar twofold existence. Conscientiously\nengaging in earthly work, they yet remain immersed in an inward beatitude. The Lord has created all men\nfrom the limitless joy of His being. Though they are painfully cramped by the body, God nevertheless expects\nthat souls made in His image shall ultimately rise above all sense identifications and reunite with Him.”\nThe cosmic vision left many permanent lessons. By daily stilling my thoughts, I could win release from the\ndelusive conviction that my body was a mass of flesh and bones, traversing the hard soil of matter. The breath\nand the restless mind, I saw, were like storms which lashed the ocean of light into waves of material\nforms−earth, sky, human beings, animals, birds, trees. No perception of the Infinite as One Light could be had\nexcept by calming those storms. As often as I silenced the two natural tumults, I beheld the multitudinous\nwaves of creation melt into one lucent sea, even as the waves of the ocean, their tempests subsiding, serenely\ndissolve into unity.\nA master bestows the divine experience of cosmic consciousness when his disciple, by meditation, has\nstrengthened his mind to a degree where the vast vistas would not overwhelm him.

He directed their minds and lives with that\ncareful discipline in which the word “disciple” is etymologically rooted.—see puri.jpg]\n“I think so, sir.”\nSri Yukteswar was silent for a few minutes, a half−suppressed smile on his lips. “No, you forgot,” he said\nfinally. “Divine contemplation must not be made an excuse for material carelessness. You have neglected\nyour duty in safeguarding the ashram; you must be punished.”\nI thought he was obscurely joking when he added: “Your six cauliflowers will soon be only five.”\nWe turned around at Master's orders and marched back until we were close to the hermitage.\n“Rest awhile. Mukunda, look across the compound on our left; observe the road beyond. A certain man will\narrive there presently; he will be the means of your chastisement.”\nI concealed my vexation at these incomprehensible remarks. A peasant soon appeared on the road; he was\ndancing grotesquely and flinging his arms about with meaningless gestures. Almost paralyzed with curiosity, I\nglued my eyes on the hilarious spectacle. As the man reached a point in the road where he would vanish from\nour view, Sri Yukteswar said, “Now, he will return.”\nThe peasant at once changed his direction and made for the rear of the ashram. Crossing a sandy tract, he\nentered the building by the back door. I had left it unlocked, even as my guru had said. The man emerged\nshortly, holding one of my prized cauliflowers. He now strode along respectably, invested with the dignity of\npossession.\nThe unfolding farce, in which my role appeared to be that of bewildered victim, was not so disconcerting that\nI failed in indignant pursuit. I was halfway to the road when Master recalled me. He was shaking from head to\nfoot with laughter.\n“That poor crazy man has been longing for a cauliflower,” he explained between outbursts of mirth. “I\nthought it would be a good idea if he got one of yours, so ill−guarded!”\nI dashed to my room, where I found that the thief, evidently one with a vegetable fixation, had left untouched\nmy gold rings, watch, and money, all lying openly on the blanket. He had crawled instead under the bed\nwhere, completely hidden from casual sight, one of my cauliflowers had aroused his singlehearted desire.\nI asked Sri Yukteswar that evening to explain the incident which had, I thought, a few baffling features.\nMy guru shook his head slowly. “You will understand it someday. Science will soon discover a few of these\nhidden laws.”\nWhen the wonders of radio burst some years later on an astounded world, I remembered Master's prediction.\nAge−old concepts of time and space were annihilated; no peasant's home so narrow that London or Calcutta\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 15.

The dullest intelligence enlarged before indisputable proof of one aspect of man's\nomnipresence.\nThe “plot” of the cauliflower comedy can be best understood by a radio analogy. Sri Yukteswar was a perfect\nhuman radio. Thoughts are no more than very gentle vibrations moving in the ether. Just as a sensitized radio\npicks up a desired musical number out of thousands of other programs from every direction, so my guru had\nbeen able to catch the thought of the half−witted man who hankered for a cauliflower, out of the countless\nthoughts of broadcasting human wills in the world. {FN15−2} By his powerful will, Master was also a human\nbroadcasting station, and had successfully directed the peasant to reverse his steps and go to a certain room for\na single cauliflower.\nIntuition {FN15−3} is soul guidance, appearing naturally in man during those instants when his mind is calm.\nNearly everyone has had the experience of an inexplicably correct “hunch,” or has transferred his thoughts\neffectively to another person.\nThe human mind, free from the static of restlessness, can perform through its antenna of intuition all the\nfunctions of complicated radio mechanisms−sending and receiving thoughts, and tuning out undesirable ones.\nAs the power of a radio depends on the amount of electrical current it can utilize, so the human radio is\nenergized according to the power of will possessed by each individual.\nAll thoughts vibrate eternally in the cosmos. By deep concentration, a master is able to detect the thoughts of\nany mind, living or dead. Thoughts are universally and not individually rooted; a truth cannot be created, but\nonly perceived. The erroneous thoughts of man result from imperfections in his discernment. The goal of yoga\nscience is to calm the mind, that without distortion it may mirror the divine vision in the universe.\nRadio and television have brought the instantaneous sound and sight of remote persons to the firesides of\nmillions: the first faint scientific intimations that man is an all−pervading spirit. Not a body confined to a\npoint in space, but the vast soul, which the ego in most barbaric modes conspires in vain to cramp.\n“Very strange, very wonderful, seemingly very improbable phenomena may yet appear which, when once\nestablished, will not astonish us more than we are now astonished at all that science has taught us during the\nlast century,” Charles Robert Richet, Nobel Prizeman in physiology, has declared. “It is assumed that the\nphenomena which we now accept without surprise, do not excite our astonishment because they are\nunderstood. But this is not the case. If they do not surprise us it is not because they are understood, it is\nbecause they are familiar; for if that which is not understood ought to surprise us, we should be surprised at\neverything−the fall of a stone thrown into the air, the acorn which becomes an oak, mercury which expands\nwhen it is heated, iron attracted by a magnet, phosphorus which burns when it is rubbed. . . . The science of\ntoday is a light matter; the revolutions and evolutions which it will experience in a hundred thousand years\nwill far exceed the most daring anticipations. The truths−those surprising, amazing, unforeseen truths−which\nour descendants will discover, are even now all around us, staring us in the eyes, so to speak, and yet we do\nnot see them. But it is not enough to say that we do not see them; we do not wish to see them; for as soon as\nan unexpected and unfamiliar fact appears, we try to fit it into the framework of the commonplaces of\nacquired knowledge, and we are indignant that anyone should dare to experiment further.”\nA humorous occurrence took place a few days after I had been so implausibly robbed of a cauliflower. A\ncertain kerosene lamp could not be found. Having so lately witnessed my guru's omniscient insight, I thought\nhe would demonstrate that it was child's play to locate the lamp.\nMaster perceived my expectation. With exaggerated gravity he questioned all ashram residents. A young\ndisciple confessed that he had used the lamp to go to the well in the back yard.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 15.

Crestfallen, I returned to my guru. He was now laughing heartily, without\ncompunction for my disillusionment.\n“Too bad I couldn't direct you to the vanished lamp; I am not a fortune teller!” With twinkling eyes, he added,\n“I am not even a satisfactory Sherlock Holmes!”\nI realized that Master would never display his powers when challenged, or for a triviality.\nDelightful weeks sped by. Sri Yukteswar was planning a religious procession. He asked me to lead the\ndisciples over the town and beach of Puri. The festive day dawned as one of the hottest of the summer.\n“Guruji, how can I take the barefooted students over the fiery sands?” I spoke despairingly.\n“I will tell you a secret,” Master responded. “The Lord will send an umbrella of clouds; you all shall walk in\ncomfort.”\nI happily organized the procession; our group started from the ashram with a SAT−SANGA banner.\n{FN15−4} Designed by Sri Yukteswar, it bore the symbol of the single {FN15−5} eye, the telescopic gaze of\nintuition.\nNo sooner had we left the hermitage than the part of the sky which was overhead became filled with clouds as\nthough by magic. To the accompaniment of astonished ejaculations from all sides, a very light shower fell,\ncooling the city streets and the burning seashore. The soothing drops descended during the two hours of the\nparade. The exact instant at which our group returned to the ashram, the clouds and rain passed away\ntracelessly.\n“You see how God feels for us,” Master replied after I had expressed my gratitude. “The Lord responds to all\nand works for all. Just as He sent rain at my plea, so He fulfills any sincere desire of the devotee. Seldom do\nmen realize how often God heeds their prayers. He is not partial to a few, but listens to everyone who\napproaches Him trustingly. His children should ever have implicit faith in the loving−kindness of their\nOmnipresent Father.” {FN15−6}\nSri Yukteswar sponsored four yearly festivals, at the equinoxes and solstices, when his students gathered from\nfar and near. The winter solstice celebration was held in Serampore; the first one I attended left me with a\npermanent blessing.\nThe festivities started in the morning with a barefoot procession along the streets. The voices of a hundred\nstudents rang out with sweet religious songs; a few musicians played the flute and KHOL KARTAL (drums\nand cymbals). Enthusiastic townspeople strewed the path with flowers, glad to be summoned from prosaic\ntasks by our resounding praise of the Lord's blessed name. The long tour ended in the courtyard of the\nhermitage. There we encircled our guru, while students on upper balconies showered us with marigold\nblossoms.\nMany guests went upstairs to receive a pudding of CHANNA and oranges. I made my way to a group of\nbrother disciples who were serving today as cooks. Food for such large gatherings had to be cooked outdoors\nin huge cauldrons. The improvised wood−burning brick stoves were smoky and tear−provoking, but we\nlaughed merrily at our work. Religious festivals in India are never considered troublesome; each one does his\npart, supplying money, rice, vegetables, or his personal services.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 15.

Busy every moment, he kept pace with the\nmost energetic young student.\nA SANKIRTAN (group chanting), accompanied by the harmonium and hand−played Indian drums, was in\nprogress on the second floor. Sri Yukteswar listened appreciatively; his musical sense was acutely perfect.\n“They are off key!” Master left the cooks and joined the artists. The melody was heard again, this time\ncorrectly rendered.\nIn India, music as well as painting and the drama is considered a divine art. Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva−the\nEternal Trinity−were the first musicians. The Divine Dancer Shiva is scripturally represented as having\nworked out the infinite modes of rhythm in His cosmic dance of universal creation, preservation, and\ndissolution, while Brahma accentuated the time−beat with the clanging cymbals, and Vishnu sounded the holy\nMRIDANGA or drum. Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu, is always shown in Hindu art with a flute, on which\nhe plays the enrapturing song that recalls to their true home the human souls wandering in MAYA−delusion.\nSaraswati, goddess of wisdom, is symbolized as performing on the VINA, mother of all stringed instruments.\nThe SAMA VEDA of India contains the world's earliest writings on musical science.\nThe foundation stone of Hindu music is the RAGAS or fixed melodic scales. The six basic RAGAS branch\nout into 126 derivative RAGINIS (wives) and PUTRAS (sons). Each RAGA has a minimum of five notes: a\nleading note (VADI or king), a secondary note (SAMAVADI or prime minister), helping notes (ANUVADI,\nattendants), and a dissonant note (VIVADI, the enemy).\nEach one of the six basic RAGAS has a natural correspondence with a certain hour of the day, season of the\nyear, and a presiding deity who bestows a particular potency. Thus, (1) the HINDOLE RAGA is heard only at\ndawn in the spring, to evoke the mood of universal love; (2) DEEPAKA RAGA is played during the evening\nin summer, to arouse compassion; (3) MEGHA RAGA is a melody for midday in the rainy season, to\nsummon courage; (4) BHAIRAVA RAGA is played in the mornings of August, September, October, to\nachieve tranquillity; (5) SRI RAGA is reserved for autumn twilights, to attain pure love; (6) MALKOUNSA\nRAGA is heard at midnights in winter, for valor.\nThe ancient rishis discovered these laws of sound alliance between nature and man. Because nature is an\nobjectification of AUM, the Primal Sound or Vibratory Word, man can obtain control over all natural\nmanifestations through the use of certain MANTRAS or chants. {FN15−7} Historical documents tell of the\nremarkable powers possessed by Miyan Tan Sen, sixteenth century court musician for Akbar the Great.\nCommanded by the Emperor to sing a night RAGA while the sun was overhead, Tan Sen intoned a MANTRA\nwhich instantly caused the whole palace precincts to become enveloped in darkness.\nIndian music divides the octave into 22 SRUTIS or demi−semitones. These microtonal intervals permit fine\nshades of musical expression unattainable by the Western chromatic scale of 12 semitones. Each one of the\nseven basic notes of the octave is associated in Hindu mythology with a color, and the natural cry of a bird or\nbeast−DO with green, and the peacock; RE with red, and the skylark; MI with golden, and the goat; FA with\nyellowish white, and the heron; SOL with black, and the nightingale; LA with yellow, and the horse; SI with a\ncombination of all colors, and the elephant.\nThree scales−major, harmonic minor, melodic minor−are the only ones which Occidental music employs, but\nIndian music outlines 72 THATAS or scales. The musician has a creative scope for endless improvisation\naround the fixed traditional melody or RAGA; he concentrates on the sentiment or definitive mood of the\nstructural theme and then embroiders it to the limits of his own originality. The Hindu musician does not read\nset notes; he clothes anew at each playing the bare skeleton of the RAGA, often confining himself to a single\nmelodic sequence, stressing by repetition all its subtle microtonal and rhythmic variations.

The traditional founder of Hindu music,\nBharata, is said to have isolated 32 kinds of TALA in the song of a lark. The origin of TALA or rhythm is\nrooted in human movements−the double time of walking, and the triple time of respiration in sleep, when\ninhalation is twice the length of exhalation. India has always recognized the human voice as the most perfect\ninstrument of sound. Hindu music therefore largely confines itself to the voice range of three octaves. For the\nsame reason, melody (relation of successive notes) is stressed, rather than harmony (relation of simultaneous\nnotes).\nThe deeper aim of the early rishi−musicians was to blend the singer with the Cosmic Song which can be heard\nthrough awakening of man's occult spinal centers. Indian music is a subjective, spiritual, and individualistic\nart, aiming not at symphonic brilliance but at personal harmony with the Oversoul. The Sanskrit word for\nmusician is BHAGAVATHAR, “he who sings the praises of God.” The SANKIRTANS or musical gatherings\nare an effective form of yoga or spiritual discipline, necessitating deep concentration, intense absorption in the\nseed thought and sound. Because man himself is an expression of the Creative Word, sound has the most\npotent and immediate effect on him, offering a way to remembrance of his divine origin.\nThe SANKIRTAN issuing from Sri Yukteswar's second−story sitting room on the day of the festival was\ninspiring to the cooks amidst the steaming pots. My brother disciples and I joyously sang the refrains, beating\ntime with our hands.\nBy sunset we had served our hundreds of visitors with KHICHURI (rice and lentils), vegetable curry, and rice\npudding. We laid cotton blankets over the courtyard; soon the assemblage was squatting under the starry\nvault, quietly attentive to the wisdom pouring from Sri Yukteswar's lips. His public speeches emphasized the\nvalue of KRIYA YOGA, and a life of self−respect, calmness, determination, simple diet, and regular exercise.\nA group of very young disciples then chanted a few sacred hymns; the meeting concluded with\nSANKIRTAN. From ten o'clock until midnight, the ashram residents washed pots and pans, and cleared the\ncourtyard. My guru called me to his side.\n“I am pleased over your cheerful labors today and during the past week of preparations. I want you with me;\nyou may sleep in my bed tonight.”\nThis was a privilege I had never thought would fall to my lot. We sat awhile in a state of intense divine\ntranquillity. Hardly ten minutes after we had gotten into bed, Master rose and began to dress.\n“What is the matter, sir?” I felt a tinge of unreality in the unexpected joy of sleeping beside my guru.\n“I think that a few students who missed their proper train connections will be here soon. Let us have some\nfood ready.”\n“Guruji, no one would come at one o'clock in the morning!”\n“Stay in bed; you have been working very hard. But I am going to cook.”\nAt Sri Yukteswar's resolute tone, I jumped up and followed him to the small daily−used kitchen adjacent to\nthe second−floor inner balcony.

The radio device actually is a radio frequency spectroscope. It does the same thing for cool,\nnonglowing matter that the spectroscope does when it discloses the kinds of atoms that make the stars. . . .\nThe existence of such rays coming from man and all living things has been suspected by scientists for many\nyears. Today is the first experimental proof of their existence. The discovery shows that every atom and every\nmolecule in nature is a continuous radio broadcasting station. . . . Thus even after death the substance that was\na man continues to send out its delicate rays. The wave lengths of these rays range from shorter than anything\nnow used in broadcasting to the longest kind of radio waves. The jumble of these rays is almost inconceivable.\nThere are millions of them. A single very large molecule may give off 1,000,000 different wave lengths at the\nsame time. The longer wave lengths of this sort travel with the ease and speed of radio waves. . . . There is one\namazing difference between the new radio rays and familiar rays like light. This is the prolonged time,\namounting to thousands of years, which these radio waves will keep on emitting from undisturbed matter.”\n{FN15−3} One hesitates to use “intuition”; Hitler has almost ruined the word along with more ambitious\ndevastations. The Latin root meaning of INTUITION is “inner protection.” The Sanskrit word AGAMA\nmeans intuitional knowledge born of direct soul−perception; hence certain ancient treatises by the rishis were\ncalled AGAMAS.\n{FN15−4} SAT is literally “being,” hence “essence; reality.” SANGA is “association.” Sri Yukteswar called\nhis hermitage organization SAT−SANGA, “fellowship with truth.”\n{FN15−5} “If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.”−MATTHEW 6:22. During\ndeep meditation, the single or spiritual eye becomes visible within the central part of the forehead.

The American\nIndians are well−known to have developed sound rituals for rain and wind. Tan Sen, the great Hindu\nmusician, was able to quench fire by the power of his song. Charles Kellogg, the California naturalist, gave a\ndemonstration of the effect of tonal vibration on fire in 1926 before a group of New York firemen. “Passing a\nbow, like an enlarged violin bow, swiftly across an aluminum tuning fork, he produced a screech like intense\nradio static. Instantly the yellow gas flame, two feet high, leaping inside a hollow glass tube, subsided to a\nheight of six inches and became a sputtering blue flare.

I don't believe in astrology.”\n“It is never a question of BELIEF; the only scientific attitude one can take on any subject is whether it is\nTRUE. The law of gravitation worked as efficiently before Newton as after him. The cosmos would be fairly\nchaotic if its laws could not operate without the sanction of human belief.\n“Charlatans have brought the stellar science to its present state of disrepute. Astrology is too vast, both\nmathematically {FN16−1} and philosophically, to be rightly grasped except by men of profound\nunderstanding. If ignoramuses misread the heavens, and see there a scrawl instead of a script, that is to be\nexpected in this imperfect world. One should not dismiss the wisdom with the 'wise.'\n“All parts of creation are linked together and interchange their influences. The balanced rhythm of the\nuniverse is rooted in reciprocity,” my guru continued. “Man, in his human aspect, has to combat two sets of\nforces−first, the tumults within his being, caused by the admixture of earth, water, fire, air, and ethereal\nelements; second, the outer disintegrating powers of nature. So long as man struggles with his mortality, he is\naffected by the myriad mutations of heaven and earth.\n“Astrology is the study of man's response to planetary stimuli. The stars have no conscious benevolence or\nanimosity; they merely send forth positive and negative radiations. Of themselves, these do not help or harm\nhumanity, but offer a lawful channel for the outward operation of cause−effect equilibriums which each man\nhas set into motion in the past.\n“A child is born on that day and at that hour when the celestial rays are in mathematical harmony with his\nindividual karma. His horoscope is a challenging portrait, revealing his unalterable past and its probable future\nresults. But the natal chart can be rightly interpreted only by men of intuitive wisdom: these are few.\n“The message boldly blazoned across the heavens at the moment of birth is not meant to emphasize fate−the\nresult of past good and evil−but to arouse man's will to escape from his universal thralldom. What he has\ndone, he can undo. None other than himself was the instigator of the causes of whatever effects are now\nprevalent in his life. He can overcome any limitation, because he created it by his own actions in the first\nplace, and because he has spiritual resources which are not subject to planetary pressure.\n“Superstitious awe of astrology makes one an automaton, slavishly dependent on mechanical guidance. The\nwise man defeats his planets—which is to say, his past−by transferring his allegiance from the creation to the\nCreator.

During the journey,\nhe takes advantage of any convenient short cut. The ancient rishis discovered many ways to curtail the period\nof man's exile in delusion. There are certain mechanical features in the law of karma which can be skillfully\nadjusted by the fingers of wisdom.\n“All human ills arise from some transgression of universal law. The scriptures point out that man must satisfy\nthe laws of nature, while not discrediting the divine omnipotence. He should say: 'Lord, I trust in Thee, and\nknow Thou canst help me, but I too will do my best to undo any wrong I have done.' By a number of\nmeans−by prayer, by will power, by yoga meditation, by consultation with saints, by use of astrological\nbangles−the adverse effects of past wrongs can be minimized or nullified.\n“Just as a house can be fitted with a copper rod to absorb the shock of lightning, so the bodily temple can be\nbenefited by various protective measures. Ages ago our yogis discovered that pure metals emit an astral light\nwhich is powerfully counteractive to negative pulls of the planets. Subtle electrical and magnetic radiations\nare constantly circulating in the universe; when a man's body is being aided, he does not know it; when it is\nbeing disintegrated, he is still in ignorance. Can he do anything about it?\n“This problem received attention from our rishis; they found helpful not only a combination of metals, but\nalso of plants and−most effective of all−faultless jewels of not less than two carats. The preventive uses of\nastrology have seldom been seriously studied outside of India. One little−known fact is that the proper jewels,\nmetals, or plant preparations are valueless unless the required weight is secured, and unless these remedial\nagents are worn next to the skin.”\n“Sir, of course I shall take your advice and get a bangle. I am intrigued at the thought of outwitting a planet!”\n“For general purposes I counsel the use of an armlet made of gold, silver, and copper. But for a specific\npurpose I want you to get one of silver and lead.” Sri Yukteswar added careful directions.\n“Guruji, what 'specific purpose' do you mean?”\n“The stars are about to take an unfriendly interest in you, Mukunda. Fear not; you shall be protected. In about\na month your liver will cause you much trouble. The illness is scheduled to last for six months, but your use of\nan astrological armlet will shorten the period to twenty−four days.”\nI sought out a jeweler the next day, and was soon wearing the bangle. My health was excellent; Master's\nprediction slipped from my mind. He left Serampore to visit Benares. Thirty days after our conversation, I felt\na sudden pain in the region of my liver.

I set fire to the horoscope scroll,\nplacing the ashes in a paper bag on which I wrote: “Seeds of past karma cannot germinate if they are roasted\nin the divine fires of wisdom.” I put the bag in a conspicuous spot; Ananta immediately read my defiant\ncomment.\n“You cannot destroy truth as easily as you have burnt this paper scroll.” My brother laughed scornfully.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 16.

Each\ntime I refused to fall in with the plans, {FN16−3} knowing that my love for God was more overwhelming\nthan any astrological persuasion from the past.\n“The deeper the self−realization of a man, the more he influences the whole universe by his subtle spiritual\nvibrations, and the less he himself is affected by the phenomenal flux.” These words of Master's often\nreturned inspiringly to my mind.\nOccasionally I told astrologers to select my worst periods, according to planetary indications, and I would still\naccomplish whatever task I set myself. It is true that my success at such times has been accompanied by\nextraordinary difficulties. But my conviction has always been justified: faith in the divine protection, and the\nright use of man's God−given will, are forces formidable beyond any the “inverted bowl” can muster.\nThe starry inscription at one's birth, I came to understand, is not that man is a puppet of his past. Its message is\nrather a prod to pride; the very heavens seek to arouse man's determination to be free from every limitation.\nGod created each man as a soul, dowered with individuality, hence essential to the universal structure,\nwhether in the temporary role of pillar or parasite. His freedom is final and immediate, if he so wills; it\ndepends not on outer but inner victories.\nSri Yukteswar discovered the mathematical application of a 24,000−year equinoctial cycle to our present age.\n{FN16−4} The cycle is divided into an Ascending Arc and a Descending Arc, each of 12,000 years. Within\neach Arc fall four YUGAS or Ages, called KALI, DWAPARA, TRETA, and SATYA, corresponding to the\nGreek ideas of Iron, Bronze, Silver, and Golden Ages.\nMy guru determined by various calculations that the last KALI YUGA or Iron Age, of the Ascending Arc,\nstarted about A.D. 500. The Iron Age, 1200 years in duration, is a span of materialism; it ended about A.D.\n1700. That year ushered in DWAPARA YUGA, a 2400−year period of electrical and atomic−energy\ndevelopments, the age of telegraph, radio, airplanes, and other space−annihilators.\nThe 3600−year period of TRETA YUGA will start in A.D. 4100; its age will be marked by common\nknowledge of telepathic communications and other time−annihilators. During the 4800 years of SATYA\nYUGA, final age in an ascending arc, the intelligence of a man will be completely developed; he will work in\nharmony with the divine plan.\nA descending arc of 12,000 years, starting with a descending Golden Age of 4800 years, then begins\n{FN16−5} for the world; man gradually sinks into ignorance. These cycles are the eternal rounds of MAYA,\nthe contrasts and relativities of the phenomenal universe. {FN16−6} Man, one by one, escapes from creation's\nprison of duality as he awakens to consciousness of his inseverable divine unity with the Creator.\nMaster enlarged my understanding not only of astrology but of the world's scriptures. Placing the holy texts\non the spotless table of his mind, he was able to dissect them with the scalpel of intuitive reasoning, and to\nseparate errors and interpolations of scholars from the truths as originally expressed by the prophets.\n“Fix one's vision on the end of the nose.” This inaccurate interpretation of a BHAGAVAD GITA stanza,\n{FN16−7} widely accepted by Eastern pundits and Western translators, used to arouse Master's droll\ncriticism.\n“The path of a yogi is singular enough as it is,” he remarked. “Why counsel him that he must also make\nhimself cross−eyed? The true meaning of NASIKAGRAM is 'origin of the nose, not 'end of the nose.' The\nnose begins at the point between the two eyebrows, the seat of spiritual vision.” {FN16−8} Because of one\nSANKHYA {FN16−9} aphorism, “ISWAR−ASHIDHA,”−\"A Lord of Creation cannot be deduced” or “God\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 16.

True SANKHYA followers, with unshakable insight born of meditation, understand that the\nLord is both existent and knowable.”\nMaster expounded the Christian Bible with a beautiful clarity. It was from my Hindu guru, unknown to the\nroll call of Christian membership, that I learned to perceive the deathless essence of the Bible, and to\nunderstand the truth in Christ's assertion−surely the most thrillingly intransigent ever uttered: “Heaven and\nearth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.” {FN16−11}\nThe great masters of India mold their lives by the same godly ideals which animated Jesus; these men are his\nproclaimed kin: “Whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and\nsister, and mother.” {FN16−12} “If ye continue in my word,” Christ pointed out, “then are ye my disciples\nindeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” {FN16−13} Freemen all, lords of\nthemselves, the Yogi−Christs of India are part of the immortal fraternity: those who have attained a liberating\nknowledge of the One Father.\n“The Adam and Eve story is incomprehensible to me!” I observed with considerable heat one day in my early\nstruggles with the allegory. “Why did God punish not only the guilty pair, but also the innocent unborn\ngenerations?”\nMaster was more amused by my vehemence than my ignorance. “GENESIS is deeply symbolic, and cannot be\ngrasped by a literal interpretation,” he explained. “Its 'tree of life' is the human body. The spinal cord is like an\nupturned tree, with man's hair as its roots, and afferent and efferent nerves as branches. The tree of the\nnervous system bears many enjoyable fruits, or sensations of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. In these,\nman may rightfully indulge; but he was forbidden the experience of sex, the 'apple' at the center of the bodily\ngarden. {FN16−14}\n“The 'serpent' represents the coiled−up spinal energy which stimulates the sex nerves. 'Adam' is reason, and\n'Eve' is feeling. When the emotion or Eve−consciousness in any human being is overpowered by the sex\nimpulse, his reason or Adam also succumbs. {FN16−15}\n“God created the human species by materializing the bodies of man and woman through the force of His will;\nHe endowed the new species with the power to create children in a similar 'immaculate' or divine manner.\n{FN16−16} Because His manifestation in the individualized soul had hitherto been limited to animals,\ninstinct−bound and lacking the potentialities of full reason, God made the first human bodies, symbolically\ncalled Adam and Eve. To these, for advantageous upward evolution, He transferred the souls or divine\nessence of two animals. {FN16−17} In Adam or man, reason predominated; in Eve or woman, feeling was\nascendant. Thus was expressed the duality or polarity which underlies the phenomenal worlds. Reason and\nfeeling remain in a heaven of cooperative joy so long as the human mind is not tricked by the serpentine\nenergy of animal propensities.\n“The human body was therefore not solely a result of evolution from beasts, but was produced by an act of\nspecial creation by God. The animal forms were too crude to express full divinity; the human being was\nuniquely given a tremendous mental capacity−the 'thousand−petaled lotus' of the brain−as well as acutely\nawakened occult centers in the spine.\n“God, or the Divine Consciousness present within the first created pair, counseled them to enjoy all human\nsensibilities, but not to put their concentration on touch sensations. {FN16−18} These were banned in order to\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 16.

The warning not to revive subconsciously−present bestial memories was not heeded. Resuming\nthe way of brute procreation, Adam and Eve fell from the state of heavenly joy natural to the original perfect\nman.\n“Knowledge of 'good and evil' refers to the cosmic dualistic compulsion. Falling under the sway of MAYA\nthrough misuse of his feeling and reason, or Eve−and Adam−consciousness, man relinquishes his right to\nenter the heavenly garden of divine self−sufficiency. {FN16−19} The personal responsibility of every human\nbeing is to restore his 'parents' or dual nature to a unified harmony or Eden.”\nAs Sri Yukteswar ended his discourse, I glanced with new respect at the pages of GENESIS.\n“Dear Master,” I said, “for the first time I feel a proper filial obligation toward Adam and Eve!”\n{FN16−1} From astronomical references in ancient Hindu scriptures, scholars have been able to correctly\nascertain the dates of the authors. The scientific knowledge of the rishis was very great; in the KAUSHITAKI\nBRAHMANA we find precise astronomical passages which show that in 3100 B.C. the Hindus were far\nadvanced in astronomy, which had a practical value in determining the auspicious times for astrological\nceremonies. In an article in EAST−WEST, February, 1934, the following summary is given of the JYOTISH\nor body of Vedic astronomical treatises: “It contains the scientific lore which kept India at the forefront of all\nancient nations and made her the mecca of seekers after knowledge. The very ancient BRAHMAGUPTA, one\nof the JYOTISH works, is an astronomical treatise dealing with such matters as the heliocentric motion of the\nplanetary bodies in our solar system, the obliquity of the ecliptic, the earth's spherical form, the reflected light\nof the moon, the earth's daily axial revolution, the presence of fixed stars in the Milky Way, the law of\ngravitation, and other scientific facts which did not dawn in the Western world until the time of Copernicus\nand Newton.”\nIt is now well−known that the so−called “Arabic numerals,” without whose symbols advanced mathematics is\ndifficult, came to Europe in the 9th century, via the Arabs, from India, where that system of notation had been\nanciently formulated. Further light on India's vast scientific heritage will be found in Dr. P. C. Ray's\nHISTORY OF HINDU CHEMISTRY, and in Dr. B. N.

The universal cycle of the scriptures is 4,300,560,000 years in extent, and measures out a Day of\nCreation or the length of life assigned to our planetary system in its present form. This vast figure given by the\nrishis is based on a relationship between the length of the solar year and a multiple of Pi (3.1416, the ratio of\nthe circumference to the diameter of a circle).\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 16.

SASI AND THE THREE SAPPHIRES\n“Because you and my son think so highly of Swami Sri Yukteswar, I will take a look at him.” The tone of\nvoice used by Dr. Narayan Chunder Roy implied that he was humoring the whim of half−wits. I concealed my\nindignation, in the best traditions of the proselyter.\nMy companion, a veterinary surgeon, was a confirmed agnostic. His young son Santosh had implored me to\ntake an interest in his father. So far my invaluable aid had been a bit on the invisible side.\nDr. Roy accompanied me the following day to the Serampore hermitage. After Master had granted him a brief\ninterview, marked for the most part by stoic silence on both sides, the visitor brusquely departed.\n“Why bring a dead man to the ashram?” Sri Yukteswar looked at me inquiringly as soon as the door had\nclosed on the Calcutta skeptic.\n“Sir! The doctor is very much alive!”\n“But in a short time he will be dead.”\nI was shocked. “Sir, this will be a terrible blow to his son. Santosh yet hopes for time to change his father's\nmaterialistic views. I beseech you, Master, to help the man.”\n“Very well; for your sake.” My guru's face was impassive. “The proud horse doctor is far gone in diabetes,\nalthough he does not know it. In fifteen days he will take to his bed. The physicians will give him up for lost;\nhis natural time to leave this earth is six weeks from today. Due to your intercession, however, on that date he\nwill recover. But there is one condition. You must get him to wear an astrological bangle; he will doubtless\nobject as violently as one of his horses before an operation!” Master chuckled.\nAfter a silence, during which I wondered how Santosh and I could best employ the arts of cajolery on the\nrecalcitrant doctor, Sri Yukteswar made further disclosures.\n“As soon as the man gets well, advise him not to eat meat. He will not heed this counsel, however, and in six\nmonths, just as he is feeling at his best, he will drop dead. Even that six−month extension of life is granted\nhim only because of your plea.”\nThe following day I suggested to Santosh that he order an armlet at the jeweler's. It was ready in a week, but\nDr. Roy refused to put it on.\n“I am in the best of health. You will never impress me with these astrological superstitions.” The doctor\nglanced at me belligerently.\nI recalled with amusement that Master had justifiably compared the man to a balky horse. Another seven days\npassed; the doctor, suddenly ill, meekly consented to wear the bangle. Two weeks later the physician in\nattendance told me that his patient's case was hopeless. He supplied harrowing details of the ravages inflicted\nby diabetes.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 17. SASI AND THE THREE SAPPHIRES\n106\n"}

Never\nbefore have I seen a dying man show such an inexplicable comeback. Your guru must indeed be a healing\nprophet!”\nAfter one interview with Dr. Roy, during which I repeated Sri Yukteswar's advice about a meatless diet, I did\nnot see the man again for six months. He stopped for a chat one evening as I sat on the piazza of my family\nhome on Gurpar Road.\n“Tell your teacher that by eating meat frequently, I have wholly regained my strength. His unscientific ideas\non diet have not influenced me.” It was true that Dr. Roy looked a picture of health.\nBut the next day Santosh came running to me from his home on the next block. “This morning Father dropped\ndead!”\nThis case was one of my strangest experiences with Master. He healed the rebellious veterinary surgeon in\nspite of his disbelief, and extended the man's natural term on earth by six months, just because of my earnest\nsupplication. Sri Yukteswar was boundless in his kindness when confronted by the urgent prayer of a devotee.\nIt was my proudest privilege to bring college friends to meet my guru. Many of them would lay aside−at least\nin the ashram!−their fashionable academic cloak of religious skepticism.\nOne of my friends, Sasi, spent a number of happy week ends in Serampore.

My\nspirit is willing but my will is weak. You are my only savior on earth; I believe in nothing else.”\n“At least you should wear a two−carat blue sapphire. It will help you.”\n“I can't afford one. Anyhow, dear guruji, if trouble comes, I fully believe you will protect me.”\n“In a year you will bring three sapphires,” Sri Yukteswar replied cryptically. “They will be of no use then.”\nVariations on this conversation took place regularly. “I can't reform!” Sasi would say in comical despair.\n“And my trust in you, Master, is more precious to me than any stone!”\nA year later I was visiting my guru at the Calcutta home of his disciple, Naren Babu. About ten o'clock in the\nmorning, as Sri Yukteswar and I were sitting quietly in the second−floor parlor, I heard the front door open.\nMaster straightened stiffly.\n“It is that Sasi,” he remarked gravely. “The year is now up; both his lungs are gone. He has ignored my\ncounsel; tell him I don't want to see him.”\nHalf stunned by Sri Yukteswar's sternness, I raced down the stairway. Sasi was ascending.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 17.

I humbly implore your aid; I know you can heal me!”\n“Isn't it a bit late now to be worrying over your life? Depart with your jewels; their time of usefulness is past.”\nMaster then sat sphinxlike in an unrelenting silence, punctuated by the boy's sobs for mercy.\nAn intuitive conviction came to me that Sri Yukteswar was merely testing the depth of Sasi's faith in the\ndivine healing power. I was not surprised a tense hour later when Master turned a sympathetic gaze on my\nprostrate friend.\n“Get up, Sasi; what a commotion you make in other people's houses! Return your sapphires to the jeweler's;\nthey are an unnecessary expense now. But get an astrological bangle and wear it. Fear not; in a few weeks you\nshall be well.”\nSasi's smile illumined his tear−marred face like sudden sun over a sodden landscape. “Beloved guru, shall I\ntake the medicines prescribed by the doctors?”\nSri Yukteswar's glance was longanimous. “Just as you wish−drink them or discard them; it does not matter. It\nis more possible for the sun and moon to interchange their positions than for you to die of tuberculosis.” He\nadded abruptly, “Go now, before I change my mind!”\nWith an agitated bow, my friend hastily departed. I visited him several times during the next few weeks, and\nwas aghast to find his condition increasingly worse.\n“Sasi cannot last through the night.” These words from his physician, and the spectacle of my friend, now\nreduced almost to a skeleton, sent me posthaste to Serampore. My guru listened coldly to my tearful report.\n“Why do you come here to bother me? You have already heard me assure Sasi of his recovery.”\nI bowed before him in great awe, and retreated to the door. Sri Yukteswar said no parting word, but sank into\nsilence, his unwinking eyes half−open, their vision fled to another world.\nI returned at once to Sasi's home in Calcutta.

Apply yourself diligently to your books for the next week: you shall get\nthrough your ordeal without failure.”\nI returned to Calcutta, firmly suppressing all reasonable doubts that occasionally arose with unnerving\nridicule. Surveying the mountain of books on my table, I felt like a traveler lost in a wilderness. A long period\nof meditation brought me a labor−saving inspiration. Opening each book at random, I studied only those\npages which lay thus exposed. Pursuing this course during eighteen hours a day for a week, I considered\nmyself entitled to advise all succeeding generations on the art of cramming.\nThe following days in the examination halls were a justification of my seemingly haphazard procedure. I\npassed all the tests, though by a hairbreadth. The congratulations of my friends and family were ludicrously\nmixed with ejaculations betraying their astonishment.\nOn his return from Puri, Sri Yukteswar gave me a pleasant surprise. “Your Calcutta studies are now over. I\nwill see that you pursue your last two years of university work right here in Serampore.”\nI was puzzled. “Sir, there is no Bachelor of Arts course in this town.” Serampore College, the sole institution\nof higher learning, offered only a two−year course in Intermediate Arts.\nMaster smiled mischievously. “I am too old to go about collecting donations to establish an A.B. college for\nyou.

The great powers that will be yours\nshould be exercised for worthy ends; never employ them selfishly! I perceive, alas! that you have brought\nover from the past some seeds of destructive tendencies. Do not allow them to sprout by watering them with\nfresh evil actions. The complexity of your previous karma is such that you must use this life to reconcile your\nyogic accomplishments with the highest humanitarian goals.'\n“After instructing the amazed boy in a complicated technique, the master vanished.\n“Afzal faithfully followed his yoga exercise for twenty years. His miraculous feats began to attract widespread\nattention. It seems that he was always accompanied by a disembodied spirit whom he called 'Hazrat.' This\ninvisible entity was able to fulfill the FAKIR'S slightest wish.\n“Ignoring his master's warning, Afzal began to misuse his powers. Whatever object he touched and then\nreplaced would soon disappear without a trace. This disconcerting eventuality usually made the Mohammedan\nan objectionable guest!\n“He visited large jewelry stores in Calcutta from time to time, representing himself as a possible purchaser.\nAny jewel he handled would vanish shortly after he had left the shop.\n“Afzal was often surrounded by several hundred students, attracted by the hope of learning his secrets. The\nFAKIR occasionally invited them to travel with him. At the railway station he would manage to touch a roll\nof tickets. These he would return to the clerk, remarking: 'I have changed my mind, and won't buy them now.'\nBut when he boarded the train with his retinue, Afzal would be in possession of the required tickets.\n{FN18−2}\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 18.

The police who sought to arrest Afzal found themselves helpless; the FAKIR could remove\nincriminating evidence merely by saying: 'Hazrat, take this away.'“\nSri Yukteswar rose from his seat and walked to the balcony of my room which overlooked the Ganges. I\nfollowed him, eager to hear more of the baffling Mohammedan Raffles.\n“This PANTHI house formerly belonged to a friend of mine. He became acquainted with Afzal and asked him\nhere. My friend also invited about twenty neighbors, including myself. I was only a youth then, and felt a\nlively curiosity about the notorious FAKIR.” Master laughed. “I took the precaution of not wearing anything\nvaluable! Afzal looked me over inquisitively, then remarked:\n“'You have powerful hands. Go downstairs to the garden; get a smooth stone and write your name on it with\nchalk; then throw the stone as far as possible into the Ganges.'\n“I obeyed. As soon as the stone had vanished under distant waves, the Mohammedan addressed me again:\n“'Fill a pot with Ganges water near the front of this house.'\n“After I had returned with a vessel of water, the FAKIR cried, 'Hazrat, put the stone in the pot!'\n“The stone appeared at once. I pulled it from the vessel and found my signature as legible as when I had\nwritten it.\n“Babu, {FN18−3} one of my friends in the room, was wearing a heavy antique gold watch and chain. The\nFAKIR examined them with ominous admiration. Soon they were missing!\n“'Afzal, please return my prized heirloom!' Babu was nearly in tears.\n“The Mohammedan was stoically silent for awhile, then said, 'You have five hundred rupees in an iron safe.\nBring them to me, and I will tell you where to locate your timepiece.'\n“The distraught Babu left immediately for his home. He came back shortly and handed Afzal the required\nsum.\n“'Go to the little bridge near your house,' the FAKIR instructed Babu. 'Call on Hazrat to give you the watch\nand chain.'\n“Babu rushed away. On his return, he was wearing a smile of relief and no jewelry whatever.\n“'When I commanded Hazrat as directed,' he announced, 'my watch came tumbling down from the air into my\nright hand! You may be sure I locked the heirloom in my safe before rejoining the group here!'\n“Babu's friends, witnesses of the comicotragedy of the ransom for a watch, were staring with resentment at\nAfzal. He now spoke placatingly.\n“'Please name any drink you want; Hazrat will produce it.'\n“A number asked for milk, others for fruit juices.

'I want an elaborate meal for my five\nhundred rupees! Everything should be served on gold plates!'\n“As soon as each man had expressed his preferences, the FAKIR addressed himself to the inexhaustible\nHazrat. A great rattle ensued; gold platters filled with intricately−prepared curries, hot LUCHIS, and many\nout−of−season fruits, landed from nowhere at our feet. All the food was delicious. After feasting for an hour,\nwe started to leave the room. A tremendous noise, as though dishes were being piled up, caused us to turn\naround. Lo! there was no sign of the glittering plates or the remnants of the meal.”\n“Guruji,” I interrupted, “if Afzal could easily secure such things as gold dishes, why did he covet the property\nof others?”\n“The FAKIR was not highly developed spiritually,” Sri Yukteswar explained. “His mastery of a certain yoga\ntechnique gave him access to an astral plane where any desire is immediately materialized. Through the\nagency of an astral being, Hazrat, the Mohammedan could summon the atoms of any object from etheric\nenergy by an act of powerful will. But such astrally−produced objects are structurally evanescent; they cannot\nbe long retained. Afzal still yearned for worldly wealth which, though more hardly earned, has a more\ndependable durability.”\nI laughed. “It too sometimes vanishes most unaccountably!”\n“Afzal was not a man of God−realization,” Master went on. “Miracles of a permanent and beneficial nature\nare performed by true saints because they have attuned themselves to the omnipotent Creator. Afzal was\nmerely an ordinary man with an extraordinary power of penetrating a subtle realm not usually entered by\nmortals until death.”\n“I understand now, Guruji. The after−world appears to have some charming features.”\nMaster agreed. “I never saw Afzal after that day, but a few years later Babu came to my home to show me a\nnewspaper account of the Mohammedan's public confession. From it I learned the facts I have just told you\nabout Afzal's early initiation from a Hindu guru.”\nThe gist of the latter part of the published document, as recalled by Sri Yukteswar, was as follows: “I, Afzal\nKhan, am writing these words as an act of penance and as a warning to those who seek the possession of\nmiraculous powers. For years I have been misusing the wondrous abilities imparted to me through the grace of\nGod and my master. I became drunk with egotism, feeling that I was beyond the ordinary laws of morality.\nMy day of reckoning finally arrived.\n“Recently I met an old man on a road outside Calcutta. He limped along painfully, carrying a shining object\nwhich looked like gold. I addressed him with greed in my heart.\n“'I am Afzal Khan, the great FAKIR. What have you there?'\n“'This ball of gold is my sole material wealth; it can be of no interest to a FAKIR. I implore you, sir, to heal\nmy limp.'\n“I touched the ball and walked away without reply.

We would often see Sri Yukteswar standing on his\nsecond−floor balcony, welcoming our approach with a smile.\nOne afternoon Kanai, a young hermitage resident, met Dijen and me at the door with disappointing news.\n“Master is not here; he was summoned to Calcutta by an urgent note.”\nThe following day I received a post card from my guru. “I shall leave Calcutta Wednesday morning,” he had\nwritten. “You and Dijen meet the nine o'clock train at Serampore station.”\nAbout eight−thirty on Wednesday morning, a telepathic message from Sri Yukteswar flashed insistently to my\nmind: “I am delayed; don't meet the nine o'clock train.”\nI conveyed the latest instructions to Dijen, who was already dressed for departure.\n“You and your intuition!” My friend's voice was edged in scorn. “I prefer to trust Master's written word.”\nI shrugged my shoulders and seated myself with quiet finality. Muttering angrily, Dijen made for the door and\nclosed it noisily behind him.\nAs the room was rather dark, I moved nearer to the window overlooking the street. The scant sunlight\nsuddenly increased to an intense brilliancy in which the iron−barred window completely vanished. Against\nthis dazzling background appeared the clearly materialized figure of Sri Yukteswar!\nBewildered to the point of shock, I rose from my chair and knelt before him. With my customary gesture of\nrespectful greeting at my guru's feet, I touched his shoes. These were a pair familiar to me, of orange−dyed\ncanvas, soled with rope. His ocher swami cloth brushed against me; I distinctly felt not only the texture of his\nrobe, but also the gritty surface of the shoes, and the pressure of his toes within them. Too much astounded to\nutter a word, I stood up and gazed at him questioningly.\n“I was pleased that you got my telepathic message.” Master's voice was calm, entirely normal. “I have now\nfinished my business in Calcutta, and shall arrive in Serampore by the ten o'clock train.”\nAs I still stared mutely, Sri Yukteswar went on, “This is not an apparition, but my flesh and blood form. I\nhave been divinely commanded to give you this experience, rare to achieve on earth. Meet me at the station;\nyou and Dijen will see me coming toward you, dressed as I am now. I shall be preceded by a fellow\npassenger−a little boy carrying a silver jug.”\nMy guru placed both hands on my head, with a murmured blessing. As he concluded with the words, “TABA\nASI,” {FN19−1} I heard a peculiar rumbling sound. {FN19−2} His body began to melt gradually within the\npiercing light. First his feet and legs vanished, then his torso and head, like a scroll being rolled up. To the\nvery last, I could feel his fingers resting lightly on my hair. The effulgence faded; nothing remained before me\nbut the barred window and a pale stream of sunlight.\nI remained in a half−stupor of confusion, questioning whether I had not been the victim of a hallucination.

WE DO NOT VISIT KASHMIR\n“Father, I want to invite Master and four friends to accompany me to the Himalayan foothills during my\nsummer vacation. May I have six train passes to Kashmir and enough money to cover our travel expenses?”\nAs I had expected, Father laughed heartily. “This is the third time you have given me the same cock−and−bull\nstory. Didn't you make a similar request last summer, and the year before that?

Though he smiled at my enthusiasm, his words were\nnoncommittal: “I would like to go; we shall see.” He made no comment when I asked his little hermitage\ndisciple, Kanai, to accompany us. I also invited three other friends—Rajendra Nath Mitra, Jotin Auddy, and\none other boy. Our date of departure was set for the following Monday.\nOn Saturday and Sunday I stayed in Calcutta, where marriage rites for a cousin were being celebrated at my\nfamily home. I arrived in Serampore with my luggage early Monday morning. Rajendra met me at the\nhermitage door.\n“Master is out, walking. He has refused to go.”\nI was equally grieved and obdurate. “I will not give Father a third chance to ridicule my chimerical plans for\nKashmir. Come; the rest of us will go anyhow.”\nRajendra agreed; I left the ashram to find a servant. Kanai, I knew, would not take the trip without Master, and\nsomeone was needed to look after the luggage. I bethought myself of Behari, previously a servant in my\nfamily home, who was now employed by a Serampore schoolmaster. As I walked along briskly, I met my\nguru in front of the Christian church near Serampore Courthouse.\n“Where are you going?” Sri Yukteswar's face was unsmiling.\n“Sir, I hear that you and Kanai will not take the trip we have been planning. I am seeking Behari. You will\nrecall that last year he was so anxious to see Kashmir that he even offered to serve without pay.”\n“I remember.

My paternal uncle, Sarada\nGhosh, a government attorney, welcomed me affectionately.\n“I am leaving today with some friends for Kashmir,” I told him. “For years I have been looking forward to\nthis Himalayan trip.”\n“I am happy for you, Mukunda.

Inasmuch as great masters seldom see fit to display their powers openly, a casual observer\nof the day's events would have imagined that their sequence was quite natural.

Our first leisurely stop was at Simla, a queenly city\nresting on the throne of Himalayan hills. We strolled over the steep streets, admiring the magnificent views.\n“English strawberries for sale,” cried an old woman, squatting in a picturesque open market place.\nMaster was curious about the strange little red fruits. He bought a basketful and offered it to Kanai and\nmyself, who were near−by. I tasted one berry but spat it hastily on the ground.\n“Sir, what a sour fruit! I could never like strawberries!”\nMy guru laughed. “Oh, you will like them−in America. At a dinner there, your hostess will serve them with\nsugar and cream. After she has mashed the berries with a fork, you will taste them and say: 'What delicious\nstrawberries!' Then you will remember this day in Simla.”\nSri Yukteswar's forecast vanished from my mind, but reappeared there many years later, shortly after my\narrival in America. I was a dinner guest at the home of Mrs. Alice T. Hasey (Sister Yogmata) in West\nSomerville, Massachusetts. When a dessert of strawberries was put on the table, my hostess picked up her fork\nand mashed my berries, adding cream and sugar. “The fruit is rather tart; I think you will like it fixed this\nway,” she remarked.\nI took a mouthful. “What delicious strawberries!” I exclaimed. At once my guru's prediction in Simla emerged\nfrom the fathomless cave of memory. It was staggering to realize that long ago Sri Yukteswar's God−tuned\nmind had sensitively detected the program of karmic events wandering in the ether of futurity.\nOur party soon left Simla and entrained for Rawalpindi. There we hired a large landau, drawn by two horses,\nin which we started a seven−day trip to Srinagar, capital city of Kashmir. The second day of our northbound\njourney brought into view the true Himalayan vastness. As the iron wheels of our carriage creaked along the\nhot, stony roads, we were enraptured with changing vistas of mountainous grandeur.\n“Sir,” Auddy said to Master, “I am greatly enjoying these glorious scenes in your holy company.”\nI felt a throb of pleasure at Auddy's appreciation, for I was acting as host on this trip.

I\ncan hardly believe that Auddy is hankering for a smoke.” {FN21−1} I looked apprehensively at my usually\nirrepressible guru.\n“Very well; I won't say anything to Auddy.” Master chuckled. “But you will soon see, when the landau halts,\nthat Auddy is quick to seize his opportunity.”\nThe carriage arrived at a small caravanserai. As our horses were led to be watered, Auddy inquired, “Sir, do\nyou mind if I ride awhile with the driver? I would like to get a little outside air.”\nSri Yukteswar gave permission, but remarked to me, “He wants fresh smoke and not fresh air.”\nThe landau resumed its noisy progress over the dusty roads.

Every night we stopped at rustic inns, and prepared our own food. Sri\nYukteswar took special care of my diet, insisting that I have lime juice at all meals. I was still weak, but daily\nimproving, though the rattling carriage was strictly designed for discomfort.\nJoyous anticipations filled our hearts as we neared central Kashmir, paradise land of lotus lakes, floating\ngardens, gaily canopied houseboats, the many−bridged Jhelum River, and flower−strewn pastures, all ringed\nround by the Himalayan majesty. Our approach to Srinagar was through an avenue of tall, welcoming trees.\nWe engaged rooms at a double−storied inn overlooking the noble hills. No running water was available; we\ndrew our supply from a near−by well. The summer weather was ideal, with warm days and slightly cold\nnights.\nWe made a pilgrimage to the ancient Srinagar temple of Swami Shankara. As I gazed upon the\nmountain−peak hermitage, standing bold against the sky, I fell into an ecstatic trance. A vision appeared of a\nhilltop mansion in a distant land. The lofty Shankara ashram before me was transformed into the structure\nwhere, years later, I established the Self−Realization Fellowship headquarters in America. When I first visited\nLos Angeles, and saw the large building on the crest of Mount Washington, I recognized it at once from my\nlong−past visions in Kashmir and elsewhere.\nA few days at Srinagar; then on to Gulmarg (“mountain paths of flowers\"), elevated by six thousand feet.\nThere I had my first ride on a large horse. Rajendra mounted a small trotter, whose heart was fired with\nambition for speed. We ventured onto the very steep Khilanmarg; the path led through a dense forest,\nabounding in tree−mushrooms, where the mist−shrouded trails were often precarious. But Rajendra's little\nanimal never permitted my oversized steed a moment's rest, even at the most perilous turns. On, on, untiringly\ncame Rajendra's horse, oblivious to all but the joy of competition.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 21. WE VISIT KASHMIR\n120\n"}

For the first time in this life, I gazed in all\ndirections at sublime snow−capped Himalayas, lying tier upon tier like silhouettes of huge polar bears. My\neyes feasted exultingly on endless reaches of icy mountains against sunny blue skies.\nI rolled merrily with my young companions, all wearing overcoats, on the sparkling white slopes. On our\ndownward trip we saw afar a vast carpet of yellow flowers, wholly transfiguring the bleak hills.\nOur next excursions were to the famous royal “pleasure gardens” of the Emperor Jehangir, at Shalimar and\nNishat Bagh. The ancient palace at Nishat Bagh is built directly over a natural waterfall. Rushing down from\nthe mountains, the torrent has been regulated through ingenious contrivances to flow over colorful terraces\nand to gush into fountains amidst the dazzling flower−beds. The stream also enters several of the palace\nrooms, ultimately dropping fairy like into the lake below. The immense gardens are riotous with color—roses\nof a dozen hues, snapdragons, lavender, pansies, poppies. An emerald enclosing outline is given by\nsymmetrical rows of CHINARS, {FN21−2} cypresses, cherry trees; beyond them tower the white austerities\nof the Himalayas.\nKashmir grapes are considered a rare delicacy in Calcutta. Rajendra, who had been promising himself a\nveritable feast on reaching Kashmir, was disappointed to find there no large vineyards. Now and then I\nchaffed him jocosely over his baseless anticipation.\n“Oh, I have become so much gorged with grapes I can't walk!” I would say. “The invisible grapes are brewing\nwithin me!” Later I heard that sweet grapes grow abundantly in Kabul, west of Kashmir. We consoled\nourselves with ice cream made of RABRI, a heavily condensed milk, and flavored with whole pistachio nuts.\nWe took several trips in the SHIKARAS or houseboats, shaded by red−embroidered canopies, coursing along\nthe intricate channels of Dal Lake, a network of canals like a watery spider web. Here the numerous floating\ngardens, crudely improvised with logs and earth, strike one with amazement, so incongruous is the first sight\nof vegetables and melons growing in the midst of vast waters. Occasionally one sees a peasant, disdaining to\nbe “rooted to the soil,” towing his square plot of “land” to a new location in the many−fingered lake.\nIn this storied vale one finds an epitome of all the earth's beauties. The Lady of Kashmir is\nmountain−crowned, lake−garlanded, and flower−shod. In later years, after I had toured many distant lands, I\nunderstood why Kashmir is often called the world's most scenic spot. It possesses some of the charms of the\nSwiss Alps, and of Loch Lomond in Scotland, and of the exquisite English lakes. An American traveler in\nKashmir finds much to remind him of the rugged grandeur of Alaska and of Pikes Peak near Denver.\nAs entries in a scenic beauty contest, I offer for first prize either the gorgeous view of Xochimilco in Mexico,\nwhere mountains, skies, and poplars reflect themselves in myriad lanes of water amidst the playful fish, or the\njewel−like lakes of Kashmir, guarded like beautiful maidens by the stern surveillance of the Himalayas. These\ntwo places stand out in my memory as the loveliest spots on earth.\nYet I was awed also when I first beheld the wonders of Yellowstone National Park and of the Grand Canyon\nof the Colorado, and of Alaska. Yellowstone Park is perhaps the only region where one can see innumerable\ngeysers shooting high into the air, performing year after year with clockwork regularity. Its opal and sapphire\npools and hot sulphurous springs, its bears and wild creatures, remind one that here Nature left a specimen of\nher earliest creation. Motoring along the roads of Wyoming to the “Devil's Paint Pot” of hot bubbling mud,\nwith gurgling springs, vaporous fountains, and spouting geysers in all directions, I was disposed to say that\nYellowstone deserves a special prize for uniqueness.\nThe ancient majestic redwoods of Yosemite, stretching their huge columns far into the unfathomable sky, are\ngreen natural cathedrals designed with skill divine.

Their long needles of\nstalactite spires, hanging from cave ceilings and mirrored in underground waters, present a glimpse of other\nworlds as fancied by man.\nMost of the Hindus of Kashmir, world−famed for their beauty, are as white as Europeans and have similar\nfeatures and bone structure; many have blue eyes and blonde hair. Dressed in Western clothes, they look like\nAmericans. The cold Himalayas protect the Kashmiris from the sultry sun and preserve their light\ncomplexions. As one travels to the southern and tropical latitudes of India, he finds progressively that the\npeople become darker and darker.\nAfter spending happy weeks in Kashmir, I was forced to return to Bengal for the fall term of Serampore\nCollege. Sri Yukteswar remained in Srinagar, with Kanai and Auddy. Before I departed, Master hinted that his\nbody would be subject to suffering in Kashmir.\n“Sir, you look a picture of health,” I protested.\n“There is a chance that I may even leave this earth.”\n“Guruji!” I fell at his feet with an imploring gesture. “Please promise that you won't leave your body now. I\nam utterly unprepared to carry on without you.”\nSri Yukteswar was silent, but smiled at me so compassionately that I felt reassured. Reluctantly I left him.\n“Master dangerously ill.” This telegram from Auddy reached me shortly after my return to Serampore.\n“Sir,” I wired my guru frantically, “I asked for your promise not to leave me. Please keep your body;\notherwise, I also shall die.”\n“Be it as you wish.” This was Sri Yukteswar's reply from Kashmir.\nA letter from Auddy arrived in a few days, informing me that Master had recovered. On his return to\nSerampore during the next fortnight, I was grieved to find my guru's body reduced to half its usual weight.\nFortunately for his disciples, Sri Yukteswar burned many of their sins in the fire of his severe fever in\nKashmir. The metaphysical method of physical transfer of disease is known to highly advanced yogis. A\nstrong man can assist a weaker one by helping to carry his heavy load; a spiritual superman is able to\nminimize his disciples' physical or mental burdens by sharing the karma of their past actions. Just as a rich\nman loses some money when he pays off a large debt for his prodigal son, who is thus saved from dire\nconsequences of his own folly, so a master willingly sacrifices a portion of his bodily wealth to lighten the\nmisery of disciples. {FN21−3}\nBy a secret method, the yogi unites his mind and astral vehicle with those of a suffering individual; the\ndisease is conveyed, wholly or in part, to the saint's body. Having harvested God on the physical field, a\nmaster no longer cares what happens to that material form. Though he may allow it to register a certain\ndisease in order to relieve others, his mind is never affected; he considers himself fortunate in being able to\nrender such aid.\nThe devotee who has achieved final salvation in the Lord finds that his body has completely fulfilled its\npurpose; he can then use it in any way he deems fit. His work in the world is to alleviate the sorrows of\nmankind, whether through spiritual means or by intellectual counsel or through will power or by the physical\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 21.

Escaping to the superconsciousness whenever he so desires, a master can remain oblivious\nof physical suffering; sometimes he chooses to bear bodily pain stoically, as an example to disciples. By\nputting on the ailments of others, a yogi can satisfy, for them, the karmic law of cause and effect. This law is\nmechanically or mathematically operative; its workings can be scientifically manipulated by men of divine\nwisdom.\nThe spiritual law does not require a master to become ill whenever he heals another person. Healings\nordinarily take place through the saint's knowledge of various methods of instantaneous cure in which no hurt\nto the spiritual healer is involved. On rare occasions, however, a master who wishes to greatly quicken his\ndisciples' evolution may then voluntarily work out on his own body a large measure of their undesirable\nkarma.\nJesus signified himself as a ransom for the sins of many. With his divine powers, {FN21−4} his body could\nnever have been subjected to death by crucifixion if he had not willingly cooperated with the subtle cosmic\nlaw of cause and effect. He thus took on himself the consequences of others' karma, especially that of his\ndisciples. In this manner they were highly purified and made fit to receive the omnipresent consciousness\nwhich later descended on them.\nOnly a self−realized master can transfer his life force, or convey into his own body the diseases of others. An\nordinary man cannot employ this yogic method of cure, nor is it desirable that he should do so; for an unsound\nphysical instrument is a hindrance to God—meditation. The Hindu scriptures teach that the first duty of man\nis to keep his body in good condition; otherwise his mind is unable to remain fixed in devotional\nconcentration.\nA very strong mind, however, can transcend all physical difficulties and attain to God−realization. Many\nsaints have ignored illness and succeeded in their divine quest. St. Francis of Assisi, severely afflicted with\nailments, healed others and even raised the dead.\nI knew an Indian saint, half of whose body was once festering with sores. His diabetic condition was so acute\nthat under ordinary conditions he could not sit still at one time for more than fifteen minutes. But his spiritual\naspiration was undeterrable. “Lord,” he prayed, “wilt Thou come into my broken temple?” With ceaseless\ncommand of will, the saint gradually became able to sit daily in the lotus posture for eighteen continuous\nhours, engrossed in the ecstatic trance.\n“And,” he told me, “at the end of three years, I found the Infinite Light blazing within my shattered form.\nRejoicing in the joyful splendour, I forgot the body. Later I saw that it had become whole through the Divine\nMercy.”\nA historical healing incident concerns King Baber (1483−1530), founder of the Mogul empire in India. His\nson, Prince Humayun, was mortally ill. The father prayed with anguished determination that he receive the\nsickness, and that his son be spared. After all physicians had given up hope, Humayun recovered. Baber\nimmediately fell sick and died of the same disease which had stricken his son. Humayun succeeded Baber as\nEmperor of Hindustan.\nMany people imagine that every spiritual master has, or should have, the health and strength of a Sandow. The\nassumption is unfounded. A sickly body does not indicate that a guru is not in touch with divine powers, any\nmore than lifelong health necessarily indicates an inner illumination. The condition of the physical body, in\nother words, cannot rightfully be made a test of a master. His distinguishing qualifications must be sought in\nhis own domain, the spiritual.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 21. WE VISIT KASHMIR\n123\n"}

When everything\nis seen as the Self, then there is not even an atom other than the Self. . . .\n“As soon as the knowledge of the Reality has sprung up, there can be no fruits of past actions to be\nexperienced, owing to the unreality of the body, in the same way as there can be no dream after waking.”\nOnly great gurus are able to assume the karma of disciples. Sri Yukteswar would not have suffered in\nKashmir unless he had received permission from the Spirit within him to help his disciples in that strange\nway. Few saints were ever more sensitively equipped with wisdom to carry out divine commands than my\nGod−tuned Master.\nWhen I ventured a few words of sympathy over his emaciated figure, my guru said gaily:\n“It has its good points; I am able now to get into some small GANJIS (undershirts) that I haven't worn in\nyears!”\nListening to Master's jovial laugh, I remembered the words of St. Francis de Sales: “A saint that is sad is a sad\nsaint!”\n{FN21−1} It is a mark of disrespect, in India, to smoke in the presence of one's elders and superiors.\n{FN21−2} The Oriental plane tree..\n{FN21−3} Many Christian saints, including Therese Neumann (see chapter 39), are familiar with the\nmetaphysical transfer of disease.\n{FN21−4} Christ said, just before he was led away to be crucified: “Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to\nmy Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?

A year earlier, my sister had asked me to initiate her into\nKRIYA YOGA, in which she was making notable progress.\nAn inspiration seized me. “Tomorrow,” I said, “I am going to the Dakshineswar temple. Please come with me,\nand persuade your husband to accompany us. I feel that in the vibrations of that holy place, Divine Mother\nwill touch his heart. But don't disclose our object in wanting him to go.”\nSister agreed hopefully. Very early the next morning I was pleased to find that Roma and her husband were in\nreadiness for the trip. As our hackney carriage rattled along Upper Circular Road toward Dakshineswar, my\nbrother−in−law, Satish Chandra Bose, amused himself by deriding spiritual gurus of the past, present, and\nfuture. I noticed that Roma was quietly weeping.\n[Illustration: Self−Realization Church of All Religions, San Diego, California—see sandiego.jpg]\n[Illustration: I stand with my two sisters, Roma (at left) and Nalini—see sisters.jpg]\n[Illustration: My sister Uma, as a young girl—see uma.jpg]\n“Sister, cheer up!” I whispered. “Don't give your husband the satisfaction of believing that we take his\nmockery seriously.”\n“Mukunda, how can you admire worthless humbugs?” Satish was saying. “A SADHU'S very appearance is\nrepulsive. He is either as thin as a skeleton, or as unholily fat as an elephant!”\nI shouted with laughter. My good−natured reaction was annoying to Satish; he retired into sullen silence. As\nour cab entered the Dakshineswar grounds, he grinned sarcastically.\n“This excursion, I suppose, is a scheme to reform me?”\nAs I turned away without reply, he caught my arm. “Young Mr. Monk,” he said, “don't forget to make proper\narrangements with the temple authorities to provide for our noon meal.”\n“I am going to meditate now. Do not worry about your lunch,” I replied sharply. “Divine Mother will look\nafter it.”\n“I don't trust Divine Mother to do a single thing for me. But I do hold you responsible for my food.” Satish's\ntones were threatening.\nI proceeded alone to the colonnaded hall which fronts the large temple of Kali, or Mother Nature. Selecting a\nshady spot near one of the pillars, I arranged my body in the lotus posture. Although it was only about seven\no'clock, the morning sun would soon be oppressive.\nThe world receded as I became devotionally entranced. My mind was concentrated on Goddess Kali, whose\nimage at Dakshineswar had been the special object of adoration by the great master, Sri Ramakrishna\nParamhansa. In answer to his anguished demands, the stone image of this very temple had often taken a living\nform and conversed with him.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 22.

Yet, when five hours had passed, and\nthe Goddess whom I was inwardly visualizing had made no response, I felt slightly disheartened. Sometimes\nit is a test by God to delay the fulfillment of prayers. But He eventually appears to the persistent devotee in\nwhatever form he holds dear. A devout Christian sees Jesus; a Hindu beholds Krishna, or the Goddess Kali, or\nan expanding Light if his worship takes an impersonal turn.\nReluctantly I opened my eyes, and saw that the temple doors were being locked by a priest, in conformance\nwith a noon−hour custom. I rose from my secluded seat under the open, roofed hall, and stepped into the\ncourtyard. Its stone floor was scorching under the midday sun; my bare feet were painfully burned.\n“Divine Mother,” I silently remonstrated, “Thou didst not come to me in vision, and now Thou art hidden in\nthe temple behind closed doors. I wanted to offer a special prayer to Thee today on behalf of my\nbrother−in−law.”\nMy inward petition was instantly acknowledged. First, a delightful cold wave descended over my back and\nunder my feet, banishing all discomfort. Then, to my amazement, the temple became greatly magnified. Its\nlarge door slowly opened, revealing the stone figure of Goddess Kali. Gradually it changed into a living form,\nsmilingly nodding in greeting, thrilling me with joy indescribable. As if by a mystic syringe, the breath was\nwithdrawn from my lungs; my body became very still, though not inert.\nAn ecstatic enlargement of consciousness followed. I could see clearly for several miles over the Ganges\nRiver to my left, and beyond the temple into the entire Dakshineswar precincts. The walls of all buildings\nglimmered transparently; through them I observed people walking to and fro over distant acres.\nThough I was breathless and my body in a strangely quiet state, yet I was able to move my hands and feet\nfreely. For several minutes I experimented in closing and opening my eyes; in either state I saw distinctly the\nwhole Dakshineswar panorama.\nSpiritual sight, x−raylike, penetrates into all matter; the divine eye is center everywhere, circumference\nnowhere. I realized anew, standing there in the sunny courtyard, that when man ceases to be a prodigal child\nof God, engrossed in a physical world indeed dream, baseless as a bubble, he reinherits his eternal realms. If\n“escapism\" be a need of man, cramped in his narrow personality, can any escape compare with the majesty of\nomnipresence?\nIn my sacred experience at Dakshineswar, the only extraordinarily−enlarged objects were the temple and the\nform of the Goddess. Everything else appeared in its normal dimensions, although each was enclosed in a halo\nof mellow light−white, blue, and pastel rainbow hues. My body seemed to be of ethereal substance, ready to\nlevitate. Fully conscious of my material surroundings, I was looking about me and taking a few steps without\ndisturbing the continuity of the blissful vision.\nBehind the temple walls I suddenly glimpsed my brother−in−law as he sat under the thorny branches of a\nsacred BEL tree. I could effortlessly discern the course of his thoughts. Somewhat uplifted under the holy\ninfluence of Dakshineswar, his mind yet held unkind reflections about me. I turned directly to the gracious\nform of the Goddess.\n“Divine Mother,” I prayed, “wilt Thou not spiritually change my sister's husband?”\nThe beautiful figure, hitherto silent, spoke at last: “Thy wish is granted!”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 22.

No longer could I see the glorious Goddess; the towering temple was\nreduced to its ordinary size, minus its transparency. Again my body sweltered under the fierce rays of the sun.\nI jumped to the shelter of the pillared hall, where Satish pursued me angrily. I looked at my watch. It was one\no'clock; the divine vision had lasted an hour.\n“You little fool,” my brother−in−law blurted out, “you have been sitting there cross−legged and cross−eyed\nfor six hours.

Now the temple is closed; you\nfailed to notify the authorities; we are left without lunch!”\nThe exaltation I had felt at the Goddess' presence was still vibrant within my heart. I was emboldened to\nexclaim, “Divine Mother will feed us!”\nSatish was beside himself with rage. “Once and for all,” he shouted, “I would like to see your Divine Mother\ngiving us food here without prior arrangements!”\nHis words were hardly uttered when a temple priest crossed the courtyard and joined us.\n“Son,” he addressed me, “I have been observing your face serenely glowing during hours of meditation. I saw\nthe arrival of your party this morning, and felt a desire to put aside ample food for your lunch. It is against the\ntemple rules to feed those who do not make a request beforehand, but I have made an exception for you.”\nI thanked him, and gazed straight into Satish's eyes. He flushed with emotion, lowering his gaze in silent\nrepentance. When we were served a lavish meal, including out−of−season mangoes, I noticed that my\nbrother−in−law's appetite was meager. He was bewildered, diving deep into the ocean of thought. On the\nreturn journey to Calcutta, Satish, with softened expression, occasionally glanced at me pleadingly. But he did\nnot speak a single word after the moment the priest had appeared to invite us to lunch, as though in direct\nanswer to Satish's challenge.\nThe following afternoon I visited my sister at her home. She greeted me affectionately.\n“Dear brother,” she cried, “what a miracle! Last evening my husband wept openly before me.\n“'Beloved DEVI,' {FN22−1} he said, 'I am happy beyond expression that this reforming scheme of your\nbrother's has wrought a transformation. I am going to undo every wrong I have done you. From tonight we\nwill use our large bedroom only as a place of worship; your small meditation room shall be changed into our\nsleeping quarters.

I was overjoyed to perceive that he had developed highly in\nself−realization, and had been blessed by the vision of Divine Mother. During my stay with him, I noticed that\nSatish secretly spent the greater part of every night in divine meditation, though he was suffering from a\nserious ailment, and was engaged during the day at his office.\nThe thought came to me that my brother−in−law's life span would not be a long one.

The Serampore College finals were child's play compared to the stiff\nones which would be set by Calcutta University for the A.B. degree. My almost daily visits to Sri Yukteswar\nhad left me little time to enter the college halls. There it was my presence rather than my absence that brought\nforth ejaculations of amazement from my classmates!\nMy customary routine was to set out on my bicycle about nine−thirty in the morning. In one hand I would\ncarry an offering for my guru−a few flowers from the garden of my PANTHI boardinghouse. Greeting me\naffably, Master would invite me to lunch. I invariably accepted with alacrity, glad to banish the thought of\ncollege for the day. After hours with Sri Yukteswar, listening to his incomparable flow of wisdom, or helping\nwith ashram duties, I would reluctantly depart around midnight for the PANTHI. Occasionally I stayed all\nnight with my guru, so happily engrossed in his conversation that I scarcely noticed when darkness changed\ninto dawn.\nOne night about eleven o'clock, as I was putting on my shoes {FN23−3} in preparation for the ride to the\nboardinghouse, Master questioned me gravely.\n“When do your A.B. examinations start?”\n“Five days hence, sir.”\n“I hope you are in readiness for them.”\nTransfixed with alarm, I held one shoe in the air. “Sir,” I protested, “you know how my days have been passed\nwith you rather than with the professors.

I felt that Master's command was unreasonable, and that\nhis interest was, to say the least, belated.\n“I will appear if you wish it,” I said amidst sobs. “But no time remains for proper preparation.” Under my\nbreath I muttered, “I will fill up the sheets with your teachings in answer to the questions!”\nWhen I entered the hermitage the following day at my usual hour, I presented my bouquet with a certain\nmournful solemnity. Sri Yukteswar laughed at my woebegone air.\n“Mukunda, has the Lord ever failed you, at an examination or elsewhere?”\n“No, sir,” I responded warmly. Grateful memories came in a revivifying flood.\n“Not laziness but burning zeal for God has prevented you from seeking college honors,” my guru said kindly.\nAfter a silence, he quoted, “'Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things\nshall be added unto you.'“ {FN23−4}\nFor the thousandth time, I felt my burdens lifted in Master's presence.

The first person I met in the boardinghouse compound was the scholarly\nRomesh. As though his days were quite free, he obligingly agreed to my diffident request.\n“Of course; I am at your service.” He spent several hours of that afternoon and of succeeding days in coaching\nme in my various subjects.\n“I believe many questions in English literature will be centered in the route of Childe Harold,” he told me.\n“We must get an atlas at once.”\nI hastened to the home of my Uncle Sarada and borrowed an atlas.

Fortunately for me, there are very few questions this year on\nEnglish authors, whose lives are wrapped in deep mystery so far as I am concerned!”\nMy boardinghouse was in an uproar when I returned. The boys who had been ridiculing Romesh's method of\ncoaching looked at me in awe, almost deafening me with congratulations. During the week of the\nexaminations, I spent many hours with Romesh, who formulated questions that he thought were likely to be\nset by the professors. Day by day, Romesh's questions appeared in almost the same form on the examination\nsheets.\nThe news was widely circulated in the college that something resembling a miracle was occurring, and that\nsuccess seemed probable for the absent−minded “Mad Monk.” I made no attempt to hide the facts of the case.\nThe local professors were powerless to alter the questions, which had been arranged by Calcutta University.\nThinking over the examination in English literature, I realized one morning that I had made a serious error.\nOne section of the questions had been divided into two parts of A or B, and C or D. Instead of answering one\nquestion from each part, I had carelessly answered both questions in Group I, and had failed to consider\nanything in Group II. The best mark I could score in that paper would be 33, three less than the passing mark\nof 36. I rushed to Master and poured out my troubles.\n“Sir, I have made an unpardonable blunder. I don't deserve the divine blessings through Romesh; I am quite\nunworthy.”\n“Cheer up, Mukunda.” Sri Yukteswar's tones were light and unconcerned. He pointed to the blue vault of the\nheavens. “It is more possible for the sun and moon to interchange their positions in space than it is for you to\nfail in getting your degree!”\nI left the hermitage in a more tranquil mood, though it seemed mathematically inconceivable that I could pass.\nI looked once or twice apprehensively into the sky; the Lord of Day appeared to be securely anchored in his\ncustomary orbit!\nAs I reached the PANTHI, I overheard a classmate's remark: “I have just learned that this year, for the first\ntime, the required passing mark in English literature has been lowered.”\nI entered the boy's room with such speed that he looked up in alarm. I questioned him eagerly.\n“Long−haired monk,” he said laughingly, “why this sudden interest in scholastic matters? Why cry in the\neleventh hour? But it is true that the passing mark has just been lowered to 33 points.”\nA few joyous leaps took me into my own room, where I sank to my knees and praised the mathematical\nperfections of my Divine Father.\nEvery day I thrilled with the consciousness of a spiritual presence that I clearly felt to be guiding me through\nRomesh. A significant incident occurred in connection with the examination in Bengali.

The examination sheet in Bengali proved to\ncontain two parts. The first instruction was: “Write two instances of the charities of Vidyasagar.” As I\ntransferred to the paper the lore that I had so recently acquired, I whispered a few words of thanksgiving that I\nhad heeded Romesh's last−minute summons. Had I been ignorant of Vidyasagar's benefactions to mankind\n(including ultimately myself), I could not have passed the Bengali examination. Failing in one subject, I\nwould have been forced to stand examination anew in all subjects the following year. Such a prospect was\nunderstandably abhorrent.\nThe second instruction on the sheet read: “Write an essay in Bengali on the life of the man who has most\ninspired you.” Gentle reader, I need not inform you what man I chose for my theme. As I covered page after\npage with praise of my guru, I smiled to realize that my muttered prediction was coming true: “I will fill up\nthe sheets with your teachings!”\nI had not felt inclined to question Romesh about my course in philosophy. Trusting my long training under Sri\nYukteswar, I safely disregarded the textbook explanations. The highest mark given to any of my papers was\nthe one in philosophy. My score in all other subjects was just barely within the passing mark.\nIt is a pleasure to record that my unselfish friend Romesh received his own degree CUM LAUDE.\nFather was wreathed in smiles at my graduation. “I hardly thought you would pass, Mukunda,” he confessed.\n“You spend so much time with your guru.” Master had indeed correctly detected the unspoken criticism of my\nfather.\nFor years I had been uncertain that I would ever see the day when an A.B. would follow my name. I seldom\nuse the title without reflecting that it was a divine gift, conferred on me for reasons somewhat obscure.\nOccasionally I hear college men remark that very little of their crammed knowledge remained with them after\ngraduation. That admission consoles me a bit for my undoubted academic deficiencies.\nOn the day I received my degree from Calcutta University, I knelt at my guru's feet and thanked him for all\nthe blessings flowing from his life into mine.\n“Get up, Mukunda,” he said indulgently. “The Lord simply found it more convenient to make you a graduate\nthan to rearrange the sun and moon!”\n{FN23−1} I must do Professor Ghoshal the justice of admitting that the strained relationship between us was\nnot due to any fault of his, but solely to my absences from classes and inattention in them.

During preceding years, in order to test the depth of my determination, he had\nrefused this same request. Today, however, he smiled graciously.\n“Very well; tomorrow I will initiate you into swamiship.” He went on quietly, “I am happy that you have\npersisted in your desire to be a monk. Lahiri Mahasaya often said: 'If you don't invite God to be your summer\nGuest, He won't come in the winter of your life.'“\n“Dear master, I could never falter in my goal to belong to the Swami Order like your revered self.” I smiled at\nhim with measureless affection.\n“He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he that is\nmarried careth for the things of the world, how he may please his wife.” {FN24−1} I had analyzed the lives of\nmany of my friends who, after undergoing certain spiritual discipline, had then married. Launched on the sea\nof worldly responsibilities, they had forgotten their resolutions to meditate deeply.\nTo allot God a secondary place in life was, to me, inconceivable. Though He is the sole Owner of the cosmos,\nsilently showering us with gifts from life to life, one thing yet remains which He does not own, and which\neach human heart is empowered to withhold or bestow−man's love. The Creator, in taking infinite pains to\nshroud with mystery His presence in every atom of creation, could have had but one motive−a sensitive desire\nthat men seek Him only through free will. With what velvet glove of every humility has He not covered the\niron hand of omnipotence!\nThe following day was one of the most memorable in my life. It was a sunny Thursday, I remember, in July,\n1914, a few weeks after my graduation from college. On the inner balcony of his Serampore hermitage,\nMaster dipped a new piece of white silk into a dye of ocher, the traditional color of the Swami Order. After\nthe cloth had dried, my guru draped it around me as a renunciate's robe.\n“Someday you will go to the West, where silk is preferred,” he said. “As a symbol, I have chosen for you this\nsilk material instead of the customary cotton.”\nIn India, where monks embrace the ideal of poverty, a silk−clad swami is an unusual sight. Many yogis,\nhowever, wear garments of silk, which preserves certain subtle bodily currents better than cotton.\n“I am averse to ceremonies,” Sri Yukteswar remarked. “I will make you a swami in the BIDWAT\n(non−ceremonious) manner.”\nThe BIBIDISA or elaborate initiation into swamiship includes a fire ceremony, during which symbolical\nfuneral rites are performed. The physical body of the disciple is represented as dead, cremated in the flame of\nwisdom. The newly−made swami is then given a chant, such as: “This ATMA is Brahma” {FN24−2} or\n“Thou art That” or “I am He.” Sri Yukteswar, however, with his love of simplicity, dispensed with all formal\nrites and merely asked me to select a new name.\n“I will give you the privilege of choosing it yourself,” he said, smiling.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 24.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 137, "text": "“Yogananda,” I replied, after a moment's thought. The name literally means “Bliss (ANANDA) through\ndivine union (YOGA).”\n“Be it so. Forsaking your family name of Mukunda Lal Ghosh, henceforth you shall be called Yogananda of\nthe Giri branch of the Swami Order.”\nAs I knelt before Sri Yukteswar, and for the first time heard him pronounce my new name, my heart\noverflowed with gratitude. How lovingly and tirelessly had he labored, that the boy Mukunda be someday\ntransformed into the monk Yogananda! I joyfully sang a few verses from the long Sanskrit chant of Lord\nShankara:\n  “Mind, nor intellect, nor ego, feeling;\n  Sky nor earth nor metals am I.\n  I am He, I am He, Blessed Spirit, I am He!\n  No birth, no death, no caste have I;\n  Father, mother, have I none.\n  I am He, I am He, Blessed Spirit, I am He!\n  Beyond the flights of fancy, formless am I,\n  Permeating the limbs of all life;\n  Bondage I do not fear; I am free, ever free,\n  I am He, I am He, Blessed Spirit, I am He!”\nEvery swami belongs to the ancient monastic order which was organized in its present form by Shankara.\n{FN24−3} Because it is a formal order, with an unbroken line of saintly representatives serving as active\nleaders, no man can give himself the title of swami. He rightfully receives it only from another swami; all\nmonks thus trace their spiritual lineage to one common guru, Lord Shankara. By vows of poverty, chastity,\nand obedience to the spiritual teacher, many Catholic Christian monastic orders resemble the Order of\nSwamis.\nIn addition to his new name, usually ending in ANANDA, the swami takes a title which indicates his formal\nconnection with one of the ten subdivisions of the Swami Order. These DASANAMIS or ten agnomens\ninclude the GIRI (mountain), to which Sri Yukteswar, and hence myself, belong. Among the other branches\nare the SAGAR (sea), BHARATI (land), ARANYA (forest), PURI (tract), TIRTHA (place of pilgrimage),\nand SARASWATI (wisdom of nature).\nThe new name received by a swami thus has a twofold significance, and represents the attainment of supreme\nbliss (ANANDA) through some divine quality or state−love, wisdom, devotion, service, yoga−and through a\nharmony with nature, as expressed in her infinite vastness of oceans, mountains, skies.\nThe ideal of selfless service to all mankind, and of renunciation of personal ties and ambitions, leads the\nmajority of swamis to engage actively in humanitarian and educational work in India, or occasionally in\nforeign lands. Ignoring all prejudices of caste, creed, class, color, sex, or race, a swami follows the precepts of\nhuman brotherhood. His goal is absolute unity with Spirit. Imbuing his waking and sleeping consciousness\nwith the thought, “I am He,” he roams contentedly, in the world but not of it. Thus only may he justify his title\nof swami−one who seeks to achieve union with the SWA or Self. It is needless to add that not all formally\ntitled swamis are equally successful in reaching their high goal.\nSri Yukteswar was both a swami and a yogi. A swami, formally a monk by virtue of his connection with the\nancient order, is not always a yogi. Anyone who practices a scientific technique of God−contact is a yogi; he\nmay be either married or unmarried, either a worldly man or one of formal religious ties. A swami may\nconceivably follow only the path of dry reasoning, of cold renunciation; but a yogi engages himself in a\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 24. I BECOME A MONK OF THE SWAMI ORDER\n134\n"}

Taking\nnothing for granted on emotional grounds, or by faith, a yogi practices a thoroughly tested series of exercises\nwhich were first mapped out by the early rishis. Yoga has produced, in every age of India, men who became\ntruly free, truly Yogi−Christs.\nLike any other science, yoga is applicable to people of every clime and time. The theory advanced by certain\nignorant writers that yoga is “unsuitable for Westerners” is wholly false, and has lamentably prevented many\nsincere students from seeking its manifold blessings. Yoga is a method for restraining the natural turbulence\nof thoughts, which otherwise impartially prevent all men, of all lands, from glimpsing their true nature of\nSpirit. Yoga cannot know a barrier of East and West any more than does the healing and equitable light of the\nsun. So long as man possesses a mind with its restless thoughts, so long will there be a universal need for yoga\nor control.\n[Illustration: THE LORD IN HIS ASPECT AS SHIVA, Not a historical personage like Krishna, Shiva is the\nname given to God in the last aspect of His threefold nature (Creator−Preserver−Destroyer). Shiva, the\nAnnihilator of maya or delusion, is symbolically represented in the scriptures as the Lord of Renunciates, the\nKing of Yogis. In Hindu art He is always shown with the new moon in His hair, and wearing a garland of\nhooded snakes, ancient emblem of evil overcome and perfect wisdom. The “single” eye of omniscience is\nopen on His forehead.—see shiva.jpg]\nThe ancient rishi Patanjali defines “yoga” as “control of the fluctuations of the mind−stuff.” {FN24−4} His\nvery short and masterly expositions, the YOGA SUTRAS, form one of the six systems of Hindu philosophy.\n{FN24−5} In contradistinction to Western philosophies, all six Hindu systems embody not only theoretical\nbut practical teachings. In addition to every conceivable ontological inquiry, the six systems formulate six\ndefinite disciplines aimed at the permanent removal of suffering and the attainment of timeless bliss.\nThe common thread linking all six systems is the declaration that no true freedom for man is possible without\nknowledge of the ultimate Reality. The later UPANISHADS uphold the YOGA SUTRAS, among the six\nsystems, as containing the most efficacious methods for achieving direct perception of truth. Through the\npractical techniques of yoga, man leaves behind forever the barren realms of speculation and cognizes in\nexperience the veritable Essence.\nThe YOGA system as outlined by Patanjali is known as the Eightfold Path. The first steps, (1) YAMA and (2)\nNIYAMA, require observance of ten negative and positive moralities−avoidance of injury to others, of\nuntruthfulness, of stealing, of incontinence, of gift−receiving (which brings obligations); and purity of body\nand mind, contentment, self−discipline, study, and devotion to God.\nThe next steps are (3) ASANA (right posture); the spinal column must be held straight, and the body firm in a\ncomfortable position for meditation; (4) PRANAYAMA (control of PRANA, subtle life currents); and (5)\nPRATYAHARA (withdrawal of the senses from external objects).\nThe last steps are forms of yoga proper: (6) DHARANA (concentration); holding the mind to one thought; (7)\nDHYANA (meditation), and (8) SAMADHI (superconscious perception). This is the Eightfold Path of Yoga\n{FN24−6} which leads one to the final goal of KAIVALYA (Absoluteness), a term which might be more\ncomprehensibly put as “realization of the Truth beyond all intellectual apprehension.”\n“Which is greater,” one may ask, “a swami or a yogi?” If and when final oneness with God is achieved, the\ndistinctions of the various paths disappear. The BHAGAVAD GITA, however, points out that the methods of\nyoga are all−embracive. Its techniques are not meant only for certain types and temperaments, such as those\nfew who incline toward the monastic life; yoga requires no formal allegiance. Because the yogic science\nsatisfies a universal need, it has a natural universal applicability.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 24. I BECOME A MONK OF THE SWAMI ORDER\n135\n"}

To fulfill one's earthly responsibilities is indeed the higher\npath, provided the yogi, maintaining a mental uninvolvement with egotistical desires, plays his part as a\nwilling instrument of God.\nThere are a number of great souls, living in American or European or other non−Hindu bodies today who,\nthough they may never have heard the words YOGI and SWAMI, are yet true exemplars of those terms.\nThrough their disinterested service to mankind, or through their mastery over passions and thoughts, or\nthrough their single hearted love of God, or through their great powers of concentration, they are, in a sense,\nyogis; they have set themselves the goal of yoga−self−control. These men could rise to even greater heights if\nthey were taught the definite science of yoga, which makes possible a more conscious direction of one's mind\nand life.\nYoga has been superficially misunderstood by certain Western writers, but its critics have never been its\npractitioners. Among many thoughtful tributes to yoga may be mentioned one by Dr. C. G. Jung, the famous\nSwiss psychologist.\n“When a religious method recommends itself as 'scientific,' it can be certain of its public in the West. Yoga\nfulfills this expectation,” Dr. Jung writes. {FN24−7} “Quite apart from the charm of the new, and the\nfascination of the half−understood, there is good cause for Yoga to have many adherents. It offers the\npossibility of controllable experience, and thus satisfies the scientific need of 'facts,' and besides this, by\nreason of its breadth and depth, its venerable age, its doctrine and method, which include every phase of life,\nit promises undreamed−of possibilities.\n“Every religious or philosophical practice means a psychological discipline, that is, a method of mental\nhygiene. The manifold, purely bodily procedures of Yoga {FN24−8} also mean a physiological hygiene\nwhich is superior to ordinary gymnastics and breathing exercises, inasmuch as it is not merely mechanistic\nand scientific, but also philosophical; in its training of the parts of the body, it unites them with the whole of\nthe spirit, as is quite clear, for instance, in the PRANAYAMA exercises where PRANA is both the breath and\nthe universal dynamics of the cosmos.\n“When the thing which the individual is doing is also a cosmic event, the effect experienced in the body (the\ninnervation), unites with the emotion of the spirit (the universal idea), and out of this there develops a lively\nunity which no technique, however scientific, can produce. Yoga practice is unthinkable, and would also be\nineffectual, without the concepts on which Yoga is based. It combines the bodily and the spiritual with each\nother in an extraordinarily complete way.\n“In the East, where these ideas and practices have developed, and where for several thousand years an\nunbroken tradition has created the necessary spiritual foundations, Yoga is, as I can readily believe, the\nperfect and appropriate method of fusing body and mind together so that they form a unity which is scarcely\nto be questioned. This unity creates a psychological disposition which makes possible intuitions that transcend\nconsciousness.”\nThe Western day is indeed nearing when the inner science of self−control will be found as necessary as the\nouter conquest of nature. This new Atomic Age will see men's minds sobered and broadened by the now\nscientifically indisputable truth that matter is in reality a concentrate of energy. Finer forces of the human\nmind can and must liberate energies greater than those within stones and metals, lest the material atomic giant,\nnewly unleashed, turn on the world in mindless destruction. {FN24−9}\n{FN24−1} I CORINTHIANS 7:32−33.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 24.

No sooner had the Chinese salesman handed me the bamboo\nsouvenir than I dropped it on the floor, crying out, “I have bought this for my dear dead brother!”\nA clear realization had swept over me that his soul was just being freed in the Infinite. The souvenir was\nsharply and symbolically cracked by its fall; amidst sobs, I wrote on the bamboo surface: “For my beloved\nAnanta, now gone.”\nMy companion, the doctor, was observing these proceedings with a sardonic smile.\n“Save your tears,” he remarked. “Why shed them until you are sure he is dead?”\nWhen our boat reached Calcutta, Dr. Misra again accompanied me. My youngest brother Bishnu was waiting\nto greet me at the dock.\n“I know Ananta has departed this life,” I said to Bishnu, before he had had time to speak. “Please tell me, and\nthe doctor here, when Ananta died.”\nBishnu named the date, which was the very day that I had bought the souvenirs in Shanghai.\n“Look here!” Dr. Misra ejaculated. “Don't let any word of this get around! The professors will be adding a\nyear's study of mental telepathy to the medical course, which is already long enough!”\nFather embraced me warmly as I entered our Gurpar Road home. “You have come,” he said tenderly. Two\nlarge tears dropped from his eyes. Ordinarily undemonstrative, he had never before shown me these signs of\naffection. Outwardly the grave father, inwardly he possessed the melting heart of a mother. In all his dealings\nwith the family, his dual parental role was distinctly manifest.\nSoon after Ananta's passing, my younger sister Nalini was brought back from death's door by a divine healing.\nBefore relating the story, I will refer to a few phases of her earlier life.\nThe childhood relationship between Nalini and myself had not been of the happiest nature. I was very thin;\nshe was thinner still. Through an unconscious motive or “complex” which psychiatrists will have no difficulty\nin identifying, I often used to tease my sister about her cadaverous appearance. Her retorts were equally\npermeated with the callous frankness of extreme youth. Sometimes Mother intervened, ending the childish\nquarrels, temporarily, by a gentle box on my ear, as the elder ear.\nTime passed; Nalini was betrothed to a young Calcutta physician, Panchanon Bose. He received a generous\ndowry from Father, presumably (as I remarked to Sister) to compensate the bridegroom−to−be for his fate in\nallying himself with a human bean−pole.\nElaborate marriage rites were celebrated in due time. On the wedding night, I joined the large and jovial group\nof relatives in the living room of our Calcutta home. The bridegroom was leaning on an immense\ngold−brocaded pillow, with Nalini at his side. A gorgeous purple silk SARI {FN25−1} could not, alas, wholly\nhide her angularity. I sheltered myself behind the pillow of my new brother−in−law and grinned at him in\nfriendly fashion. He had never seen Nalini until the day of the nuptial ceremony, when he finally learned what\nhe was getting in the matrimonial lottery.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 25.

He\nand I became fast friends, often joking together, usually with Nalini as our target.\n“It is a medical curiosity,” my brother−in−law remarked to me one day. “I have tried everything on your lean\nsister−cod liver oil, butter, malt, honey, fish, meat, eggs, tonics. Still she fails to bulge even one−hundredth of\nan inch.” We both chuckled.\nA few days later I visited the Bose home. My errand there took only a few minutes; I was leaving, unnoticed, I\nthought, by Nalini. As I reached the front door, I heard her voice, cordial but commanding.\n“Brother, come here. You are not going to give me the slip this time. I want to talk to you.”\nI mounted the stairs to her room. To my surprise, she was in tears.\n“Dear brother,” she said, “let us bury the old hatchet. I see that your feet are now firmly set on the spiritual\npath. I want to become like you in every way.” She added hopefully, “You are now robust in appearance; can\nyou help me? My husband does not come near me, and I love him so dearly! But still more I want to progress\nin God−realization, even if I must remain thin {FN25−2} and unattractive.”\nMy heart was deeply touched at her plea. Our new friendship steadily progressed; one day she asked to\nbecome my disciple.\n“Train me in any way you like. I put my trust in God instead of tonics.” She gathered together an armful of\nmedicines and poured them down the roof drain.\nAs a test of her faith, I asked her to omit from her diet all fish, meat, and eggs.\nAfter several months, during which Nalini had strictly followed the various rules I had outlined, and had\nadhered to her vegetarian diet in spite of numerous difficulties, I paid her a visit.\n“Sis, you have been conscientiously observing the spiritual injunctions; your reward is near.” I smiled\nmischievously. “How plump do you want to be−as fat as our aunt who hasn't seen her feet in years?”\n“No! But I long to be as stout as you are.”\nI replied solemnly. “By the grace of God, as I have spoken truth always, I speak truly now. {FN25−3}\nThrough the divine blessings, your body shall verily change from today; in one month it shall have the same\nweight as mine.”\nThese words from my heart found fulfillment. In thirty days, Nalini's weight equalled mine. The new\nroundness gave her beauty; her husband fell deeply in love. Their marriage, begun so inauspiciously, turned\nout to be ideally happy.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 25. BROTHER ANANTA AND SISTER NALINI\n139\n"}

I\nrushed to her home, and was aghast to find her reduced to a mere skeleton. She was in a coma.\n“Before her mind became confused by illness,” my brother−in−law told me, “she often said: 'If brother\nMukunda were here, I would not be faring thus.'“ He added despairingly, “The other doctors and myself see\nno hope. Blood dysentery has set in, after her long bout with typhoid.”\nI began to move heaven and earth with my prayers. Engaging an Anglo−Indian nurse, who gave me full\ncooperation, I applied to my sister various yoga techniques of healing. The blood dysentery disappeared.\nBut Dr. Bose shook his head mournfully. “She simply has no more blood left to shed.”\n“She will recover,” I replied stoutly. “In seven days her fever will be gone.”\nA week later I was thrilled to see Nalini open her eyes and gaze at me with loving recognition. From that day\nher recovery was swift. Although she regained her usual weight, she bore one sad scar of her nearly fatal\nillness: her legs were paralyzed. Indian and English specialists pronounced her a hopeless cripple.\nThe incessant war for her life which I had waged by prayer had exhausted me. I went to Serampore to ask Sri\nYukteswar's help. His eyes expressed deep sympathy as I told him of Nalini's plight.\n“Your sister's legs will be normal at the end of one month.” He added, “Let her wear, next to her skin, a band\nwith an unperforated two−carat pearl, held on by a clasp.”\nI prostrated myself at his feet with joyful relief.\n“Sir, you are a master; your word of her recovery is enough But if you insist I shall immediately get her a\npearl.”\nMy guru nodded. “Yes, do that.” He went on to correctly describe the physical and mental characteristics of\nNalini, whom he had never seen.\n“Sir,” I inquired, “is this an astrological analysis? You do not know her birth day or hour.”\nSri Yukteswar smiled. “There is a deeper astrology, not dependent on the testimony of calendars and clocks.\nEach man is a part of the Creator, or Cosmic Man; he has a heavenly body as well as one of earth. The human\neye sees the physical form, but the inward eye penetrates more profoundly, even to the universal pattern of\nwhich each man is an integral and individual part.”\nI returned to Calcutta and purchased a pearl for Nalini. A month later, her paralyzed legs were completely\nhealed.\nSister asked me to convey her heartfelt gratitude to my guru. He listened to her message in silence. But as I\nwas taking my leave, he made a pregnant comment.\n“Your sister has been told by many doctors that she can never bear children. Assure her that in a few years she\nwill give birth to two daughters.”\nSome years later, to Nalini's joy, she bore a girl, followed in a few years by another daughter.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 25.

THE SCIENCE OF KRIYA YOGA\nThe science of KRIYA YOGA, mentioned so often in these pages, became widely known in modern India\nthrough the instrumentality of Lahiri Mahasaya, my guru's guru. The Sanskrit root of KRIYA is KRI, to do, to\nact and react; the same root is found in the word KARMA, the natural principle of cause and effect. KRIYA\nYOGA is thus “union (yoga) with the Infinite through a certain action or rite.” A yogi who faithfully follows\nits technique is gradually freed from karma or the universal chain of causation.\nBecause of certain ancient yogic injunctions, I cannot give a full explanation of KRIYA YOGA in the pages\nof a book intended for the general public. The actual technique must be learned from a KRIYABAN or\nKRIYA YOGI; here a broad reference must suffice.\nKRIYA YOGA is a simple, psychophysiological method by which the human blood is decarbonized and\nrecharged with oxygen. The atoms of this extra oxygen are transmuted into life current to rejuvenate the brain\nand spinal centers. {FN26−1} By stopping the accumulation of venous blood, the yogi is able to lessen or\nprevent the decay of tissues; the advanced yogi transmutes his cells into pure energy. Elijah, Jesus, Kabir and\nother prophets were past masters in the use of KRIYA or a similar technique, by which they caused their\nbodies to dematerialize at will.\nKRIYA is an ancient science. Lahiri Mahasaya received it from his guru, Babaji, who rediscovered and\nclarified the technique after it had been lost in the Dark Ages.\n“The KRIYA YOGA which I am giving to the world through you in this nineteenth century,” Babaji told\nLahiri Mahasaya, “is a revival of the same science which Krishna gave, millenniums ago, to Arjuna, and\nwhich was later known to Patanjali, and to Christ, St. John, St. Paul, and other disciples.”\nKRIYA YOGA is referred to by Krishna, India's greatest prophet, in a stanza of the BHAGAVAD GITA:\n“Offering inhaling breath into the outgoing breath, and offering the outgoing breath into the inhaling breath,\nthe yogi neutralizes both these breaths; he thus releases the life force from the heart and brings it under his\ncontrol.” {FN26−2} The interpretation is: “The yogi arrests decay in the body by an addition of life force, and\narrests the mutations of growth in the body by APAN (eliminating current). Thus neutralizing decay and\ngrowth, by quieting the heart, the yogi learns life control.”\nKrishna also relates {FN26−3} that it was he, in a former incarnation, who communicated the indestructible\nyoga to an ancient illuminato, Vivasvat, who gave it to Manu, the great legislator. {FN26−4} He, in turn,\ninstructed Ikshwaku, the father of India's solar warrior dynasty. Passing thus from one to another, the royal\nyoga was guarded by the rishis until the coming of the materialistic ages. {FN26−5} Then, due to priestly\nsecrecy and man's indifference, the sacred knowledge gradually became inaccessible.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 26. THE SCIENCE OF KRIYA YOGA\n141\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 145, "text": "KRIYA YOGA is mentioned twice by the ancient sage Patanjali, foremost exponent of yoga, who wrote:\n“KRIYA YOGA consists of body discipline, mental control, and meditating on AUM.” {FN26−6} Patanjali\nspeaks of God as the actual Cosmic Sound of AUM heard in meditation. {FN26−7} AUM is the Creative\nWord, {FN26−8} the sound of the Vibratory Motor. Even the yoga−beginner soon inwardly hears the\nwondrous sound of AUM. Receiving this blissful spiritual encouragement, the devotee becomes assured that\nhe is in actual touch with divine realms.\nPatanjali refers a second time to the life−control or KRIYA technique thus: “Liberation can be accomplished\nby that PRANAYAMA which is attained by disjoining the course of inspiration and expiration.” {FN26−9}\nSt. Paul knew KRIYA YOGA, or a technique very similar to it, by which he could switch life currents to and\nfrom the senses. He was therefore able to say: “Verily, I protest by our rejoicing which I have in Christ, I DIE\nDAILY.” {FN26−10} By daily withdrawing his bodily life force, he united it by yoga union with the rejoicing\n(eternal bliss) of the Christ consciousness. In that felicitous state, he was consciously aware of being dead to\nthe delusive sensory world of MAYA.\nIn the initial states of God−contact (SABIKALPA SAMADHI) the devotee's consciousness merges with the\nCosmic Spirit; his life force is withdrawn from the body, which appears “dead,” or motionless and rigid. The\nyogi is fully aware of his bodily condition of suspended animation. As he progresses to higher spiritual states\n(NIRBIKALPA SAMADHI), however, he communes with God without bodily fixation, and in his ordinary\nwaking consciousness, even in the midst of exacting worldly duties. {FN26−11}\n“KRIYA YOGA is an instrument through which human evolution can be quickened,” Sri Yukteswar\nexplained to his students. “The ancient yogis discovered that the secret of cosmic consciousness is intimately\nlinked with breath mastery. This is India's unique and deathless contribution to the world's treasury of\nknowledge. The life force, which is ordinarily absorbed in maintaining the heart−pump, must be freed for\nhigher activities by a method of calming and stilling the ceaseless demands of the breath.”\nThe KRIYA YOGI mentally directs his life energy to revolve, upward and downward, around the six spinal\ncenters (medullary, cervical, dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal plexuses) which correspond to the twelve\nastral signs of the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man. One−half minute of revolution of energy around the\nsensitive spinal cord of man effects subtle progress in his evolution; that half−minute of KRIYA equals one\nyear of natural spiritual unfoldment.\nThe astral system of a human being, with six (twelve by polarity) inner constellations revolving around the\nsun of the omniscient spiritual eye, is interrelated with the physical sun and the twelve zodiacal signs. All men\nare thus affected by an inner and an outer universe. The ancient rishis discovered that man's earthly and\nheavenly environment, in twelve−year cycles, push him forward on his natural path. The scriptures aver that\nman requires a million years of normal, diseaseless evolution to perfect his human brain sufficiently to\nexpress cosmic consciousness.\nOne thousand KRIYA practiced in eight hours gives the yogi, in one day, the equivalent of one thousand years\nof natural evolution: 365,000 years of evolution in one year. In three years, a KRIYA YOGI can thus\naccomplish by intelligent self−effort the same result which nature brings to pass in a million years. The\nKRIYA short cut, of course, can be taken only by deeply developed yogis. With the guidance of a guru, such\nyogis have carefully prepared their bodies and brains to receive the power created by intensive practice.\nThe KRIYA beginner employs his yogic exercise only fourteen to twenty−eight times, twice daily. A number\nof yogis achieve emancipation in six or twelve or twenty−four or forty−eight years. A yogi who dies before\nachieving full realization carries with him the good karma of his past KRIYA effort; in his new life he is\nharmoniously propelled toward his Infinite Goal.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 26.

Through gradual and regular increase of the simple and\n“foolproof” methods of KRIYA, man's body becomes astrally transformed day by day, and is finally fitted to\nexpress the infinite potentials of cosmic energy−the first materially active expression of Spirit.\nKRIYA YOGA has nothing in common with the unscientific breathing exercises taught by a number of\nmisguided zealots. Their attempts to forcibly hold breath in the lungs is not only unnatural but decidedly\nunpleasant. KRIYA, on the other hand, is accompanied from the very beginning by an accession of peace, and\nby soothing sensations of regenerative effect in the spine.\nThe ancient yogic technique converts the breath into mind. By spiritual advancement, one is able to cognize\nthe breath as an act of mind−a dream−breath.\nMany illustrations could be given of the mathematical relationship between man's respiratory rate and the\nvariations in his states of consciousness. A person whose attention is wholly engrossed, as in following some\nclosely knit intellectual argument, or in attempting some delicate or difficult physical feat, automatically\nbreathes very slowly. Fixity of attention depends on slow breathing; quick or uneven breaths are an inevitable\naccompaniment of harmful emotional states: fear, lust, anger. The restless monkey breathes at the rate of 32\ntimes a minute, in contrast to man's average of 18 times. The elephant, tortoise, snake and other animals noted\nfor their longevity have a respiratory rate which is less than man's. The tortoise, for instance, who may attain\nthe age of 300 years, {FN26−12} breathes only 4 times per minute.\nThe rejuvenating effects of sleep are due to man's temporary unawareness of body and breathing. The sleeping\nman becomes a yogi; each night he unconsciously performs the yogic rite of releasing himself from bodily\nidentification, and of merging the life force with healing currents in the main brain region and the six\nsub−dynamos of his spinal centers. The sleeper thus dips unknowingly into the reservoir of cosmic energy\nwhich sustains all life.\nThe voluntary yogi performs a simple, natural process consciously, not unconsciously like the slow−paced\nsleeper. The KRIYA YOGI uses his technique to saturate and feed all his physical cells with undecaying light\nand keep them in a magnetized state. He scientifically makes breath unnecessary, without producing the states\nof subconscious sleep or unconsciousness.\nBy KRIYA, the outgoing life force is not wasted and abused in the senses, but constrained to reunite with\nsubtler spinal energies. By such reinforcement of life, the yogi's body and brain cells are electrified with the\nspiritual elixir. Thus he removes himself from studied observance of natural laws, which can only take\nhim−by circuitous means as given by proper food, sunlight, and harmonious thoughts−to a million−year Goal.\nIt needs twelve years of normal healthful living to effect even slight perceptible change in brain structure, and\na million solar returns are exacted to sufficiently refine the cerebral tenement for manifestation of cosmic\nconsciousness.\nUntying the cord of breath which binds the soul to the body, KRIYA serves to prolong life and enlarge the\nconsciousness to infinity. The yoga method overcomes the tug of war between the mind and the matter−bound\nsenses, and frees the devotee to reinherit his eternal kingdom. He knows his real nature is bound neither by\nphysical encasement nor by breath, symbol of the mortal enslavement to air, to nature's elemental\ncompulsions.\nIntrospection, or “sitting in the silence,” is an unscientific way of trying to force apart the mind and senses,\ntied together by the life force. The contemplative mind, attempting its return to divinity, is constantly dragged\nback toward the senses by the life currents. KRIYA, controlling the mind DIRECTLY through the life force,\nis the easiest, most effective, and most scientific avenue of approach to the Infinite.

Yoga enables the devotee to switch off or on, at will, life current from the five sense telephones of\nsight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Attaining this power of sense−disconnection, the yogi finds it simple to\nunite his mind at will with divine realms or with the world of matter. No longer is he unwillingly brought back\nby the life force to the mundane sphere of rowdy sensations and restless thoughts. Master of his body and\nmind, the KRIYA YOGI ultimately achieves victory over the “last enemy,” death.\nSo shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men: And Death once dead, there's no more dying then. {FN26−13}\nThe life of an advanced KRIYA YOGI is influenced, not by effects of past actions, but solely by directions\nfrom the soul. The devotee thus avoids the slow, evolutionary monitors of egoistic actions, good and bad, of\ncommon life, cumbrous and snail−like to the eagle hearts.\nThe superior method of soul living frees the yogi who, shorn of his ego−prison, tastes the deep air of\nomnipresence. The thralldom of natural living is, in contrast, set in a pace humiliating. Conforming his life to\nthe evolutionary order, a man can command no concessionary haste from nature but, living without error\nagainst the laws of his physical and mental endowment, still requires about a million years of incarnating\nmasquerades to know final emancipation.\nThe telescopic methods of yogis, disengaging themselves from physical and mental identifications in favor of\nsoul−individuality, thus commend themselves to those who eye with revolt a thousand thousand years. This\nnumerical periphery is enlarged for the ordinary man, who lives in harmony not even with nature, let alone his\nsoul, but pursues instead unnatural complexities, thus offending in his body and thoughts the sweet sanities of\nnature. For him, two times a million years can scarce suffice for liberation.\nGross man seldom or never realizes that his body is a kingdom, governed by Emperor Soul on the throne of\nthe cranium, with subsidiary regents in the six spinal centers or spheres of consciousness. This theocracy\nextends over a throng of obedient subjects: twenty−seven thousand billion cells−endowed with a sure if\nautomatic intelligence by which they perform all duties of bodily growths, transformations, and\ndissolutions−and fifty million substratal thoughts, emotions, and variations of alternating phases in man's\nconsciousness in an average life of sixty years. Any apparent insurrection of bodily or cerebral cells toward\nEmperor Soul, manifesting as disease or depression, is due to no disloyalty among the humble citizens, but to\npast or present misuse by man of his individuality or free will, given to him simultaneous with a soul, and\nrevocable never.\nIdentifying himself with a shallow ego, man takes for granted that it is he who thinks, wills, feels, digests\nmeals, and keeps himself alive, never admitting through reflection (only a little would suffice!) that in his\nordinary life he is naught but a puppet of past actions (karma) and of nature or environment. Each man's\nintellectual reactions, feelings, moods, and habits are circumscribed by effects of past causes, whether of this\nor a prior life. Lofty above such influences, however, is his regal soul. Spurning the transitory truths and\nfreedoms, the KRIYA YOGI passes beyond all disillusionment into his unfettered Being. All scriptures\ndeclare man to be not a corruptible body, but a living soul; by KRIYA he is given a method to prove the\nscriptural truth.\n“Outward ritual cannot destroy ignorance, because they are not mutually contradictory,” wrote Shankara in his\nfamous CENTURY OF VERSES. “Realized knowledge alone destroys ignorance. . . . Knowledge cannot\nspring up by any other means than inquiry. 'Who am I? How was this universe born? Who is its maker? What\nis its material cause?' This is the kind of inquiry referred to.” The intellect has no answer for these questions;\nhence the rishis evolved yoga as the technique of spiritual inquiry.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 26.

Although I made no outward reply, an adamant resolution arose in my breast: I\nwould share with my fellows, so far as lay in my power, the unshackling truths I had learned at my guru's feet.\n“Lord,” I prayed, “may Thy Love shine forever on the sanctuary of my devotion, and may I be able to awaken\nthat Love in other hearts.”\nOn a previous occasion, before I had joined the monastic order, Sri Yukteswar had made a most unexpected\nremark.\n“How you will miss the companionship of a wife in your old age!” he had said. “Do you not agree that the\nfamily man, engaged in useful work to maintain his wife and children, thus plays a rewarding role in God's\neyes?”\n“Sir,” I had protested in alarm, “you know that my desire in this life is to espouse only the Cosmic Beloved.”\nMaster had laughed so merrily that I understood his observation was made merely as a test of my faith.\n“Remember,” he had said slowly, “that he who discards his worldly duties can justify himself only by\nassuming some kind of responsibility toward a much larger family.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 27.

I saw clearly the arid results\nof ordinary instruction, aimed only at the development of body and intellect. Moral and spiritual values,\nwithout whose appreciation no man can approach happiness, were yet lacking in the formal curriculum. I\ndetermined to found a school where young boys could develop to the full stature of manhood. My first step in\nthat direction was made with seven children at Dihika, a small country site in Bengal.\nA year later, in 1918, through the generosity of Sir Manindra Chandra Nundy, the Maharaja of Kasimbazar, I\nwas able to transfer my fast−growing group to Ranchi. This town in Bihar, about two hundred miles from\nCalcutta, is blessed with one of the most healthful climates in India. The Kasimbazar Palace at Ranchi was\ntransformed into the headquarters for the new school, which I called BRAHMACHARYA VIDYALAYA\n{FN27−1} in accordance with the educational ideals of the rishis. Their forest ashrams had been the ancient\nseats of learning, secular and divine, for the youth of India.\nAt Ranchi I organized an educational program for both grammar and high school grades. It included\nagricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic subjects. The students were also taught yoga concentration\nand meditation, and a unique system of physical development, “Yogoda,” whose principles I had discovered\nin 1916.\nRealizing that man's body is like an electric battery, I reasoned that it could be recharged with energy through\nthe direct agency of the human will. As no action, slight or large, is possible without WILLING, man can\navail himself of his prime mover, will, to renew his bodily tissues without burdensome apparatus or\nmechanical exercises. I therefore taught the Ranchi students my simple “Yogoda” techniques by which the life\nforce, centred in man's medulla oblongata, can be consciously and instantly recharged from the unlimited\nsupply of cosmic energy.\nThe boys responded wonderfully to this training, developing extraordinary ability to shift the life energy from\none part of the body to another part, and to sit in perfect poise in difficult body postures. {FN27−2} They\nperformed feats of strength and endurance which many powerful adults could not equal. My youngest brother,\nBishnu Charan Ghosh, joined the Ranchi school; he later became a leading physical culturist in Bengal. He\nand one of his students traveled to Europe and America, giving exhibitions of strength and skill which amazed\nthe university savants, including those at Columbia University in New York.\nAt the end of the first year at Ranchi, applications for admission reached two thousand. But the school, which\nat that time was solely residential, could accommodate only about one hundred. Instruction for day students\nwas soon added.\nIn the VIDYALAYA I had to play father−mother to the little children, and to cope with many organizational\ndifficulties. I often remembered Christ's words: “Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house,\nor brethren or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, but he\nshall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and\nlands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.” {FN27−3} Sri Yukteswar had interpreted\nthese words: “The devotee who forgoes the life−experiences of marriage and family, and exchanges the\nproblems of a small household and limited activities for the larger responsibilities of service to society in\ngeneral, is undertaking a task which is often accompanied by persecution from a misunderstanding world, but\nalso by a divine inner contentment.”\n[Illustration: Yogoda Math, beautiful hermitage of Self−Realization Fellowship at Dakshineswar on the\nGanges.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 151, "text": "the philanthropic Lahiri Mahasaya Mission.—see ranchi.jpg]\nOne day my father arrived in Ranchi to bestow a paternal blessing, long withheld because I had hurt him by\nrefusing his offer of a position with the Bengal−Nagpur Railway.\n“Son,” he said, “I am now reconciled to your choice in life. It gives me joy to see you amidst these happy,\neager youngsters; you belong here rather than with the lifeless figures of railroad timetables.” He waved\ntoward a group of a dozen little ones who were tagging at my heels. “I had only eight children,” he observed\nwith twinkling eyes, “but I can feel for you!”\nWith a large fruit orchard and twenty−five fertile acres at our disposal, the students, teachers, and myself\nenjoyed many happy hours of outdoor labor in these ideal surroundings. We had many pets, including a young\ndeer who was fairly idolized by the children. I too loved the fawn so much that I allowed it to sleep in my\nroom. At the light of dawn, the little creature would toddle over to my bed for a morning caress.\nOne day I fed the pet earlier than usual, as I had to attend to some business in the town of Ranchi. Although I\ncautioned the boys not to feed the fawn until my return, one of them was disobedient, and gave the baby deer\na large quantity of milk. When I came back in the evening, sad news greeted me: “The little fawn is nearly\ndead, through over feeding.”\nIn tears, I placed the apparently lifeless pet on my lap. I prayed piteously to God to spare its life. Hours later,\nthe small creature opened its eyes, stood up, and walked feebly. The whole school shouted for joy.\nBut a deep lesson came to me that night, one I can never forget. I stayed up with the fawn until two o'clock,\nwhen I fell asleep. The deer appeared in a dream, and spoke to me:\n“You are holding me back. Please let me go; let me go!”\n“All right,” I answered in the dream.\nI awoke immediately, and cried out, “Boys, the deer is dying!” The children rushed to my side.\nI ran to the corner of the room where I had placed the pet. It made a last effort to rise, stumbled toward me,\nthen dropped at my feet, dead.\nAccording to the mass karma which guides and regulates the destinies of animals, the deer's life was over, and\nit was ready to progress to a higher form. But by my deep attachment, which I later realized was selfish, and\nby my fervent prayers, I had been able to hold it in the limitations of the animal form from which the soul was\nstruggling for release. The soul of the deer made its plea in a dream because, without my loving permission, it\neither would not or could not go. As soon as I agreed, it departed.\nAll sorrow left me; I realized anew that God wants His children to love everything as a part of Him, and not to\nfeel delusively that death ends all. The ignorant man sees only the unsurmountable wall of death, hiding,\nseemingly forever, his cherished friends. But the man of unattachment, he who loves others as expressions of\nthe Lord, understands that at death the dear ones have only returned for a breathing−space of joy in Him.\nThe Ranchi school grew from small and simple beginnings to an institution now well−known in India. Many\ndepartments of the school are supported by voluntary contributions from those who rejoice in perpetuating the\neducational ideals of the rishis. Under the general name of YOGODA SAT−SANGA, {FN27−4} flourishing\nbranch schools have been established at Midnapore, Lakshmanpur, and Puri.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 27.

The number treated has averaged more than 18,000 persons a year.\nThe VIDYALAYA has made its mark, too, in Indian competitive sports, and in the scholastic field, where\nmany Ranchi alumni have distinguished themselves in later university life.\nThe school, now in its twenty−eighth year and the center of many activities, {FN27−5} has been honored by\nvisits of eminent men from the East and the West. One of the earliest great figures to inspect the\nVIDYALAYA in its first year was Swami Pranabananda, the Benares “saint with two bodies.” As the great\nmaster viewed the picturesque outdoor classes, held under the trees, and saw in the evening that young boys\nwere sitting motionless for hours in yoga meditation, he was profoundly moved.\n“Joy comes to my heart,” he said, “to see that Lahiri Mahasaya's ideals for the proper training of youth are\nbeing carried on in this institution. My guru's blessings be on it.”\nA young lad sitting by my side ventured to ask the great yogi a question.\n“Sir,” he said, “shall I be a monk? Is my life only for God?”\nThough Swami Pranabananda smiled gently, his eyes were piercing the future.\n“Child,” he replied, “when you grow up, there is a beautiful bride waiting for you.” The boy did eventually\nmarry, after having planned for years to enter the Swami Order.\nSometime after Swami Pranabananda had visited Ranchi, I accompanied my father to the Calcutta house\nwhere the yogi was temporarily staying. Pranabananda's prediction, made to me so many years before, came\nrushing to my mind: “I shall see you, with your father, later on.”\nAs Father entered the swami's room, the great yogi rose from his seat and embraced my parent with loving\nrespect.\n“Bhagabati,” he said, “what are you doing about yourself? Don't you see your son racing to the Infinite?” I\nblushed to hear his praise before my father. The swami went on, “You recall how often our blessed guru used\nto say: 'BANAT, BANAT, BAN JAI.' {FN26−6} So keep up KRIYA YOGA ceaselessly, and reach the divine\nportals quickly.”\nThe body of Pranabananda, which had appeared so well and strong during my amazing first visit to him in\nBenares, now showed definite aging, though his posture was still admirably erect.\n“Swamiji,” I inquired, looking straight into his eyes, “please tell me the truth: Aren't you feeling the advance\nof age? As the body is weakening, are your perceptions of God suffering any diminution?”\nHe smiled angelically. “The Beloved is more than ever with me now.” His complete conviction overwhelmed\nmy mind and soul. He went on, “I am still enjoying the two pensions−one from Bhagabati here, and one from\nabove.” Pointing his finger heavenward, the saint fell into an ecstasy, his face lit with a divine glow−an ample\nanswer to my question.\nNoticing that Pranabananda's room contained many plants and packages of seed, I asked their purpose.\n“I have left Benares permanently,” he said, “and am now on my way to the Himalayas. There I shall open an\nashram for my disciples. These seeds will produce spinach and a few other vegetables. My dear ones will live\nsimply, spending their time in blissful God−union.

He reminded me of a little heavenly\nchild, sitting securely on the lap of the Divine Mother. The burden of the years has no ill effect on a great\nyogi's full possession of supreme spiritual powers. He is able to renew his body at will; yet sometimes he does\nnot care to retard the aging process, but allows his karma to work itself out on the physical plane, using his old\nbody as a time−saving device to exclude the necessity of working out karma in a new incarnation.\nMonths later I met an old friend, Sanandan, who was one of Pranabananda's close disciples.\n“My adorable guru is gone,” he told me, amidst sobs. “He established a hermitage near Rishikesh, and gave us\nloving training. When we were pretty well settled, and making rapid spiritual progress in his company, he\nproposed one day to feed a huge crowd from Rishikesh. I inquired why he wanted such a large number.\n“'This is my last festival ceremony,' he said. I did not understand the full implications of his words.\n“Pranabanandaji helped with the cooking of great amounts of food. We fed about 2000 guests. After the feast,\nhe sat on a high platform and gave an inspired sermon on the Infinite. At the end, before the gaze of\nthousands, he turned to me, as I sat beside him on the dais, and spoke with unusual force.\n“'Sanandan, be prepared; I am going to kick the frame.' {FN27−7}\n“After a stunned silence, I cried loudly, 'Master, don't do it! Please, please, don't do it!' The crowd was\ntongue−tied, watching us curiously. My guru smiled at me, but his solemn gaze was already fixed on Eternity.\n“'Be not selfish,' he said, 'nor grieve for me. I have been long cheerfully serving you all; now rejoice and wish\nme Godspeed. I go to meet my Cosmic Beloved.' In a whisper, Pranabanandaji added, 'I shall be reborn\nshortly. After enjoying a short period of the Infinite Bliss, I shall return to earth and join Babaji. {FN27−8}\nYou shall soon know when and where my soul has been encased in a new body.'\n“He cried again, 'Sanandan, here I kick the frame by the second KRIYA YOGA.' {FN27−9}\n“He looked at the sea of faces before us, and gave a blessing. Directing his gaze inwardly to the spiritual eye,\nhe became immobile. While the bewildered crowd thought he was meditating in an ecstatic state, he had\nalready left the tabernacle of flesh and plunged his soul into the cosmic vastness. The disciples touched his\nbody, seated in the lotus posture, but it was no longer the warm flesh. Only a stiffened frame remained; the\ntenant had fled to the immortal shore.”\nI inquired where Pranabananda was to be reborn.\n“That's a sacred trust I cannot divulge to anyone,” Sanandan replied. “Perhaps you may find out some other\nway.”\nYears later I discovered from Swami Keshabananda {FN27−10} that Pranabananda, a few years after his birth\nin a new body, had gone to Badrinarayan in the Himalayas, and there joined the group of saints around the\ngreat Babaji.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 27.

He was about twelve years old, a\nbrilliant student, and beloved by all.\n“Sir,” he said, “what will be my fate?”\n“You shall soon be dead.” The reply came from my lips with an irresistible force.\nThis unexpected disclosure shocked and grieved me as well as everyone present. Silently rebuking myself as\nan ENFANT TERRIBLE, I refused to answer further questions.\nOn our return to the school, Kashi came to my room.\n“If I die, will you find me when I am reborn, and bring me again to the spiritual path?” He sobbed.\nI felt constrained to refuse this difficult occult responsibility. But for weeks afterward, Kashi pressed me\ndoggedly. Seeing him unnerved to the breaking point, I finally consoled him.\n“Yes,” I promised. “If the Heavenly Father lends His aid, I will try to find you.”\nDuring the summer vacation, I started on a short trip. Regretting that I could not take Kashi with me, I called\nhim to my room before leaving, and carefully instructed him to remain, against all persuasion, in the spiritual\nvibrations of the school. Somehow I felt that if he did not go home, he might avoid the impending calamity.\nNo sooner had I left than Kashi's father arrived in Ranchi. For fifteen days he tried to break the will of his son,\nexplaining that if Kashi would go to Calcutta for only four days to see his mother, he could then return. Kashi\npersistently refused. The father finally said he would take the boy away with the help of the police. The threat\ndisturbed Kashi, who was unwilling to be the cause of any unfavorable publicity to the school.

He was a soul\nvibrating with unfulfilled desires, I realized−a mass of light floating somewhere amidst millions of luminous\nsouls in the astral regions. How was I to tune in with him, among so many vibrating lights of other souls?\nUsing a secret yoga technique, I broadcasted my love to Kashi's soul through the microphone of the spiritual\neye, the inner point between the eyebrows. With the antenna of upraised hands and fingers, I often turned\nmyself round and round, trying to locate the direction in which he had been reborn as an embryo.

For the first time, there was response. I thrilled to detect electrical impulses trickling down\nmy fingers and palms. These currents translated themselves into one overpowering thought from a deep recess\nof my consciousness: “I am Kashi; I am Kashi; come to me!”\nThe thought became almost audible as I concentrated on my heart radio.

The\nelectrical impulses tingled through my fingers only when I faced toward a near−by path, aptly named\n“Serpentine Lane.” The astral currents disappeared when I turned in other directions.\n“Ah,” I exclaimed, “Kashi's soul must be living in the womb of some mother whose home is in this lane.”\nMy companions and I approached closer to Serpentine Lane; the vibrations in my upraised hands grew\nstronger, more pronounced. As if by a magnet, I was pulled toward the right side of the road. Reaching the\nentrance of a certain house, I was astounded to find myself transfixed.

He emanated a soothing aura of charm, culture, and courtliness.\nReplying to my question about his literary background, Tagore told me that one ancient source of his\ninspiration, besides our religious epics, had been the classical poet, Bidyapati.”\nInspired by these memories, I began to sing Tagore's version of an old Bengali song, “Light the Lamp of Thy\nLove.” Bhola and I chanted joyously as we strolled over the VIDYALAYA grounds.\nAbout two years after founding the Ranchi school, I received an invitation from Rabindranath to visit him at\nSantiniketan in order to discuss our educational ideals. I went gladly. The poet was seated in his study when I\nentered; I thought then, as at our first meeting, that he was as striking a model of superb manhood as any\npainter could desire. His beautifully chiseled face, nobly patrician, was framed in long hair and flowing beard.\nLarge, melting eyes; an angelic smile; and a voice of flutelike quality which was literally enchanting.\nStalwart, tall, and grave, he combined an almost womanly tenderness with the delightful spontaneity of a\nchild. No idealized conception of a poet could find more suitable embodiment than in this gentle singer.\nTagore and I were soon deep in a comparative study of our schools, both founded along unorthodox lines. We\ndiscovered many identical features−outdoor instruction, simplicity, ample scope for the child's creative spirit.\nRabindranath, however, laid considerable stress on the study of literature and poetry, and the self−expression\nthrough music and song which I had already noted in the case of Bhola. The Santiniketan children observed\nperiods of silence, but were given no special yoga training.\nThe poet listened with flattering attention to my description of the energizing “Yogoda” exercises and the\nyoga concentration techniques which are taught to all students at Ranchi.\nTagore told me of his own early educational struggles. “I fled from school after the fifth grade,” he said,\nlaughing. I could readily understand how his innate poetic delicacy had been affronted by the dreary,\ndisciplinary atmosphere of a schoolroom.\n“That is why I opened Santiniketan under the shady trees and the glories of the sky.” He motioned eloquently\nto a little group studying in the beautiful garden. “A child is in his natural setting amidst the flowers and\nsongbirds. Only thus may he fully express the hidden wealth of his individual endowment. True education can\nnever be crammed and pumped from without; rather it must aid in bringing spontaneously to the surface the\ninfinite hoards of wisdom within.” {FN29−2}\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 29.

The eight\nthousand pounds which came with the Nobel Prize all went for the upkeep of the school.”\nThe elder Tagore, Devendranath, known far and wide as “Maharishi,” was a very remarkable man, as one may\ndiscover from his AUTOBIOGRAPHY. Two years of his manhood were spent in meditation in the\nHimalayas. In turn, his father, Dwarkanath Tagore, had been celebrated throughout Bengal for his munificent\npublic benefactions. From this illustrious tree has sprung a family of geniuses. Not Rabindranath alone; all his\nrelatives have distinguished themselves in creative expression.

Never assertive, he drew and captured the heart by an\nirresistible magnetism.

Most of his\nsongs and plays, written for the delectation of his students, have been composed at Santiniketan. The beauty\nof his lines, to me, lies in his art of referring to God in nearly every stanza, yet seldom mentioning the sacred\nName. “Drunk with the bliss of singing,” he wrote, “I forget myself and call thee friend who art my lord.”\nThe following day, after lunch, I bade the poet a reluctant farewell.

THE LAW OF MIRACLES\nThe great novelist Leo Tolstoy wrote a delightful story, THE THREE HERMITS. His friend Nicholas Roerich\n{FN30−1} has summarized the tale, as follows:\n“On an island there lived three old hermits. They were so simple that the only prayer they used was: 'We are\nthree; Thou art Three−have mercy on us!' Great miracles were manifested during this naive prayer.\n“The local bishop {FN30−2} came to hear about the three hermits and their inadmissible prayer, and decided\nto visit them in order to teach them the canonical invocations. He arrived on the island, told the hermits that\ntheir heavenly petition was undignified, and taught them many of the customary prayers. The bishop then left\non a boat. He saw, following the ship, a radiant light. As it approached, he discerned the three hermits, who\nwere holding hands and running upon the waves in an effort to overtake the vessel.\n“'We have forgotten the prayers you taught us,' they cried as they reached the bishop, 'and have hastened to\nask you to repeat them.' The awed bishop shook his head.\n“'Dear ones,' he replied humbly, 'continue to live with your old prayer!'“\nHow did the three saints walk on the water?\nHow did Christ resurrect his crucified body?\nHow did Lahiri Mahasaya and Sri Yukteswar perform their miracles?\nModern science has, as yet, no answer; though with the advent of the atomic bomb and the wonders of radar,\nthe scope of the world−mind has been abruptly enlarged. The word “impossible” is becoming less prominent\nin the scientific vocabulary.\nThe ancient Vedic scriptures declare that the physical world operates under one fundamental law of MAYA,\nthe principle of relativity and duality. God, the Sole Life, is an Absolute Unity; He cannot appear as the\nseparate and diverse manifestations of a creation except under a false or unreal veil. That cosmic illusion is\nMAYA. Every great scientific discovery of modern times has served as a confirmation of this simple\npronouncement of the rishis.\nNewton's Law of Motion is a law of MAYA: “To every action there is always an equal and contrary reaction;\nthe mutual actions of any two bodies are always equal and oppositely directed.” Action and reaction are thus\nexactly equal. “To have a single force is impossible. There must be, and always is, a pair of forces equal and\nopposite.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 30. THE LAW OF MIRACLES\n157\n"}

Electricity, for example, is a phenomenon of\nrepulsion and attraction; its electrons and protons are electrical opposites. Another example: the atom or final\nparticle of matter is, like the earth itself, a magnet with positive and negative poles. The entire phenomenal\nworld is under the inexorable sway of polarity; no law of physics, chemistry, or any other science is ever\nfound free from inherent opposite or contrasted principles.\nPhysical science, then, cannot formulate laws outside of MAYA, the very texture and structure of creation.\nNature herself is MAYA; natural science must perforce deal with her ineluctable quiddity. In her own domain,\nshe is eternal and inexhaustible; future scientists can do no more than probe one aspect after another of her\nvaried infinitude. Science thus remains in a perpetual flux, unable to reach finality; fit indeed to formulate the\nlaws of an already existing and functioning cosmos, but powerless to detect the Law Framer and Sole\nOperator. The majestic manifestations of gravitation and electricity have become known, but what gravitation\nand electricity are, no mortal knoweth. {FN30−3}\n[Illustration: A GURU AND DISCIPLE, Forest hermitages were the ancient seats of learning, secular and\ndivine, for the youth of India. Here a venerable guru, leaning on a wooden meditation elbow−prop, is\ninitiating his disciple into the august mysteries of Spirit.—see guru.jpg]\nTo surmount MAYA was the task assigned to the human race by the millennial prophets. To rise above the\nduality of creation and perceive the unity of the Creator was conceived of as man's highest goal. Those who\ncling to the cosmic illusion must accept its essential law of polarity: flow and ebb, rise and fall, day and night,\npleasure and pain, good and evil, birth and death. This cyclic pattern assumes a certain anguishing monotony,\nafter man has gone through a few thousand human births; he begins to cast a hopeful eye beyond the\ncompulsions of MAYA.\nTo tear the veil of MAYA is to pierce the secret of creation. The yogi who thus denudes the universe is the\nonly true monotheist. All others are worshiping heathen images. So long as man remains subject to the\ndualistic delusions of nature, the Janus−faced MAYA is his goddess; he cannot know the one true God.\nThe world illusion, MAYA, is individually called AVIDYA, literally, “not−knowledge,” ignorance, delusion.\nMAYA or AVIDYA can never be destroyed through intellectual conviction or analysis, but solely through\nattaining the interior state of NIRBIKALPA SAMADHI. The Old Testament prophets, and seers of all lands\nand ages, spoke from that state of consciousness. Ezekiel says (43:1−2): “Afterwards he brought me to the\ngate, even the gate that looketh toward the east: and, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way\nof the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.” Through the\ndivine eye in the forehead (east), the yogi sails his consciousness into omnipresence, hearing the Word or\nAum, divine sound of many waters or vibrations which is the sole reality of creation.\nAmong the trillion mysteries of the cosmos, the most phenomenal is light. Unlike sound−waves, whose\ntransmission requires air or other material media, light−waves pass freely through the vacuum of interstellar\nspace. Even the hypothetical ether, held as the interplanetary medium of light in the undulatory theory, can be\ndiscarded on the Einsteinian grounds that the geometrical properties of space render the theory of ether\nunnecessary. Under either hypothesis, light remains the most subtle, the freest from material dependence, of\nany natural manifestation.\nIn the gigantic conceptions of Einstein, the velocity of light−186,000 miles per second−dominates the whole\nTheory of Relativity. He proves mathematically that the velocity of light is, so far as man's finite mind is\nconcerned, the only CONSTANT in a universe of unstayable flux. On the sole absolute of light−velocity\ndepend all human standards of time and space.

Reducing the cosmical structure to variations on a single law,\nEinstein {FN30−4} reaches across the ages to the rishis who proclaimed a sole texture of creation−that of a\nprotean MAYA.\nOn the epochal Theory of Relativity have arisen the mathematical possibilities of exploring the ultimate atom.\nGreat scientists are now boldly asserting not only that the atom is energy rather than matter, but that atomic\nenergy is essentially mind−stuff.\n“The frank realization that physical science is concerned with a world of shadows is one of the most\nsignificant advances,” Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington writes in THE NATURE OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD.\n“In the world of physics we watch a shadowgraph performance of the drama of familiar life. The shadow of\nmy elbow rests on the shadow table as the shadow ink flows over the shadow paper. It is all symbolic, and as\na symbol the physicist leaves it. Then comes the alchemist Mind who transmutes the symbols. . . . To put the\nconclusion crudely, the stuff of the world is mind−stuff. . . . The realistic matter and fields of force of former\nphysical theory are altogether irrelevant except in so far as the mind−stuff has itself spun these imaginings. . .\n. The external world has thus become a world of shadows. In removing our illusions we have removed the\nsubstance, for indeed we have seen that substance is one of the greatest of our illusions.”\nWith the recent discovery of the electron microscope came definite proof of the light−essence of atoms and of\nthe inescapable duality of nature. THE NEW YORK TIMES gave the following report of a 1937\ndemonstration of the electron microscope before a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement\nof Science:\n“The crystalline structure of tungsten, hitherto known only indirectly by means of X−rays, stood outlined\nboldly on a fluorescent screen, showing nine atoms in their correct positions in the space lattice, a cube, with\none atom in each corner and one in the center. The atoms in the crystal lattice of the tungsten appeared on the\nfluorescent screen as points of light, arranged in geometric pattern. Against this crystal cube of light the\nbombarding molecules of air could be observed as dancing points of light, similar to points of sunlight\nshimmering on moving waters. . . .\n“The principle of the electron microscope was first discovered in 1927 by Drs. Clinton J. Davisson and Lester\nH. Germer of the Bell Telephone Laboratories, New York City, who found that the electron had a dual\npersonality partaking of the characteristic of both a particle and a wave. The wave quality gave the electron\nthe characteristic of light, and a search was begun to devise means for 'focusing' electrons in a manner similar\nto the focusing of light by means of a lens.\n“For his discovery of the Jekyll−Hyde quality of the electron, which corroborated the prediction made in 1924\nby De Broglie, French Nobel Prize winning physicist, and showed that the entire realm of physical nature had\na dual personality, Dr. Davisson also received the Nobel Prize in physics.”\n“The stream of knowledge,” Sir James Jeans writes in THE MYSTERIOUS UNIVERSE, “is heading towards\na non−mechanical reality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine.”\nTwentieth−century science is thus sounding like a page from the hoary VEDAS.\nFrom science, then, if it must be so, let man learn the philosophic truth that there is no material universe; its\nwarp and woof is MAYA, illusion. Its mirages of reality all break down under analysis.

The release of\nthe atomic energies is brought about through the annihilation of the material particles. The “death” of matter\nhas been the “birth” of an Atomic Age.\nLight−velocity is a mathematical standard or constant not because there is an absolute value in 186,000 miles\na second, but because no material body, whose mass increases with its velocity, can ever attain the velocity of\nlight. Stated another way: only a material body whose mass is infinite could equal the velocity of light.\nTHIS CONCEPTION BRINGS US TO THE LAW OF MIRACLES.\nThe masters who are able to materialize and dematerialize their bodies or any other object, and to move with\nthe velocity of light, and to utilize the creative light−rays in bringing into instant visibility any physical\nmanifestation, have fulfilled the necessary Einsteinian condition: their mass is infinite.\nThe consciousness of a perfected yogi is effortlessly identified, not with a narrow body, but with the universal\nstructure. Gravitation, whether the “force” of Newton or the Einsteinian “manifestation of inertia,” is\npowerless to COMPEL a master to exhibit the property of “weight” which is the distinguishing gravitational\ncondition of all material objects. He who knows himself as the omnipresent Spirit is subject no longer to the\nrigidities of a body in time and space. Their imprisoning “rings−pass−not” have yielded to the solvent: “I am\nHe.”\n“Fiat lux! And there was light.” God's first command to His ordered creation (GENESIS 1:3) brought into\nbeing the only atomic reality: light. On the beams of this immaterial medium occur all divine manifestations.\nDevotees of every age testify to the appearance of God as flame and light. “The King of kings, and Lord of\nlords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto.” {FN30−5}\nA yogi who through perfect meditation has merged his consciousness with the Creator perceives the cosmical\nessence as light; to him there is no difference between the light rays composing water and the light rays\ncomposing land. Free from matter−consciousness, free from the three dimensions of space and the fourth\ndimension of time, a master transfers his body of light with equal ease over the light rays of earth, water, fire,\nor air. Long concentration on the liberating spiritual eye has enabled the yogi to destroy all delusions\nconcerning matter and its gravitational weight; thenceforth he sees the universe as an essentially\nundifferentiated mass of light.\n“Optical images,” Dr. L. T. Troland of Harvard tells us, “are built up on the same principle as the ordinary\n'half−tone' engravings; that is, they are made up of minute dottings or stripplings far too small to be detected\nby the eye. . . . The sensitiveness of the retina is so great that a visual sensation can be produced by relatively\nfew Quanta of the right kind of light.” Through a master's divine knowledge of light phenomena, he can\ninstantly project into perceptible manifestation the ubiquitous light atoms. The actual form of the\nprojection−whether it be a tree, a medicine, a human body−is in conformance with a yogi's powers of will and\nof visualization.\nIn man's dream−consciousness, where he has loosened in sleep his clutch on the egoistic limitations that daily\nhem him round, the omnipotence of his mind has a nightly demonstration. Lo! there in the dream stand the\nlong−dead friends, the remotest continents, the resurrected scenes of his childhood. With that free and\nunconditioned consciousness, known to all men in the phenomena of dreams, the God−tuned master has\nforged a never−severed link. Innocent of all personal motives, and employing the creative will bestowed on\nhim by the Creator, a yogi rearranges the light atoms of the universe to satisfy any sincere prayer of a devotee.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 30.

I jumped into the\nwater, together with the few sailors who had survived the explosion.\nHeart pounding, I reached the shore safely. But alas! a stray bullet ended its furious flight in my chest. I fell\ngroaning to the ground.

I found myself seated in the lotus posture in my Gurpar Road room.\nHysterical tears poured forth as I joyfully stroked and pinched my regained possession−a body free from any\nbullet hole in the breast. I rocked to and fro, inhaling and exhaling to assure myself that I was alive. Amidst\nthese self−congratulations, again I found my consciousness transferred to the captain's dead body by the gory\nshore. Utter confusion of mind came upon me.\n“Lord,” I prayed, “am I dead or alive?”\nA dazzling play of light filled the whole horizon. A soft rumbling vibration formed itself into words:\n“What has life or death to do with Light? In the image of My Light I have made you.

The wonders of the motion picture, of radio, of television, of\nradar, of the photo−electric cell−the all−seeing “electric eye,” of atomic energies, are all based on the\nelectromagnetic phenomenon of light.\nThe motion picture art can portray any miracle.

The colorful universal drama is similarly issuing from the single white light of a\nCosmic Source. With inconceivable ingenuity God is staging an entertainment for His human children,\nmaking them actors as well as audience in His planetary theater.\nOne day I entered a motion picture house to view a newsreel of the European battlefields. World War I was\nstill being waged in the West; the newsreel recorded the carnage with such realism that I left the theater with a\ntroubled heart.\n“Lord,” I prayed, “why dost Thou permit such suffering?”\nTo my intense surprise, an instant answer came in the form of a vision of the actual European battlefields. The\nhorror of the struggle, filled with the dead and dying, far surpassed in ferocity any representation of the\nnewsreel.\n“Look intently!” A gentle voice spoke to my inner consciousness. “You will see that these scenes now being\nenacted in France are nothing but a play of chiaroscuro. They are the cosmic motion picture, as real and as\nunreal as the theater newsreel you have just seen−a play within a play.”\nMy heart was still not comforted. The divine voice went on: “Creation is light and shadow both, else no\npicture is possible. The good and evil of MAYA must ever alternate in supremacy. If joy were ceaseless here\nin this world, would man ever seek another? Without suffering he scarcely cares to recall that he has forsaken\nhis eternal home. Pain is a prod to remembrance.

She received me graciously at the\nold Lahiri homestead in the Garudeswar Mohulla section of Benares. Although aged, she was blooming like a\nlotus, silently emanating a spiritual fragrance. She was of medium build, with a slender neck and fair skin.\nLarge, lustrous eyes softened her motherly face.\n“Son, you are welcome here. Come upstairs.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 31.

I felt honored\nto witness the shrine in which the peerless master had condescended to play the human drama of matrimony.\nThe gentle lady motioned me to a pillow seat by her side.\n“It was years before I came to realize the divine stature of my husband,” she began. “One night, in this very\nroom, I had a vivid dream. Glorious angels floated in unimaginable grace above me. So realistic was the sight\nthat I awoke at once; the room was strangely enveloped in dazzling light.\n“My husband, in lotus posture, was levitated in the center of the room, surrounded by angels who were\nworshiping him with the supplicating dignity of palm−folded hands. Astonished beyond measure, I was\nconvinced that I was still dreaming.\n“'Woman,' Lahiri Mahasaya said, 'you are not dreaming. Forsake your sleep forever and forever.' As he slowly\ndescended to the floor, I prostrated myself at his feet.\n“'Master,' I cried, 'again and again I bow before you! Will you pardon me for having considered you as my\nhusband? I die with shame to realize that I have remained asleep in ignorance by the side of one who is\ndivinely awakened. From this night, you are no longer my husband, but my guru. Will you accept my\ninsignificant self as your disciple?' {FN31−1}\n“The master touched me gently. 'Sacred soul, arise. You are accepted.' He motioned toward the angels. 'Please\nbow in turn to each of these holy saints.'\n“When I had finished my humble genuflections, the angelic voices sounded together, like a chorus from an\nancient scripture.\n“'Consort of the Divine One, thou art blessed. We salute thee.' They bowed at my feet and lo! their refulgent\nforms vanished. The room darkened.\n“My guru asked me to receive initiation into KRIYA YOGA.\n“'Of course,' I responded. 'I am sorry not to have had its blessing earlier in my life.'\n“'The time was not ripe.' Lahiri Mahasaya smiled consolingly. 'Much of your karma I have silently helped you\nto work out. Now you are willing and ready.'\n“He touched my forehead. Masses of whirling light appeared; the radiance gradually formed itself into the\nopal−blue spiritual eye, ringed in gold and centered with a white pentagonal star.\n“'Penetrate your consciousness through the star into the kingdom of the Infinite.' My guru's voice had a new\nnote, soft like distant music.\n“Vision after vision broke as oceanic surf on the shores of my soul. The panoramic spheres finally melted in a\nsea of bliss. I lost myself in ever−surging blessedness. When I returned hours later to awareness of this world,\nthe master gave me the technique of KRIYA YOGA.\n“From that night on, Lahiri Mahasaya never slept in my room again. Nor, thereafter, did he ever sleep. He\nremained in the front room downstairs, in the company of his disciples both by day and by night.”\nThe illustrious lady fell into silence. Realizing the uniqueness of her relationship with the sublime yogi, I\nfinally ventured to ask for further reminiscences.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 31.

Nevertheless you shall have one more story.” She smiled shyly. “I will confess a sin\nwhich I committed against my guru−husband. Some months after my initiation, I began to feel forlorn and\nneglected. One morning Lahiri Mahasaya entered this little room to fetch an article; I quickly followed him.\nOvercome by violent delusion, I addressed him scathingly.\n“'You spend all your time with the disciples. What about your responsibilities for your wife and children? I\nregret that you do not interest yourself in providing more money for the family.'\n“The master glanced at me for a moment, then lo! he was gone. Awed and frightened, I heard a voice\nresounding from every part of the room:\n“'It is all nothing, don't you see? How could a nothing like me produce riches for you?'\n“'Guruji,' I cried, 'I implore pardon a million times! My sinful eyes can see you no more; please appear in your\nsacred form.'\n“'I am here.' This reply came from above me. I looked up and saw the master materialize in the air, his head\ntouching the ceiling. His eyes were like blinding flames. Beside myself with fear, I lay sobbing at his feet after\nhe had quietly descended to the floor.\n“'Woman,' he said, 'seek divine wealth, not the paltry tinsel of earth. After acquiring inward treasure, you will\nfind that outward supply is always forthcoming.' He added, 'One of my spiritual sons will make provision for\nyou.'\n“My guru's words naturally came true; a disciple did leave a considerable sum for our family.”\nI thanked Kashi Moni for sharing with me her wondrous experiences. {FN31−2} On the following day I\nreturned to her home and enjoyed several hours of philosophical discussion with Tincouri and Ducouri Lahiri.\nThese two saintly sons of India's great yogi followed closely in his ideal footsteps. Both men were fair, tall,\nstalwart, and heavily bearded, with soft voices and an old−fashioned charm of manner.\nHis wife was not the only woman disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya; there were hundreds of others, including my\nmother. A woman chela once asked the guru for his photograph. He handed her a print, remarking, “If you\ndeem it a protection, then it is so; otherwise it is only a picture.”\nA few days later this woman and Lahiri Mahasaya's daughter−in−law happened to be studying the\nBHAGAVAD GITA at a table behind which hung the guru's photograph. An electrical storm broke out with\ngreat fury.\n“Lahiri Mahasaya, protect us!” The women bowed before the picture. Lightning struck the book which they\nhad been reading, but the two devotees were unhurt.\n“I felt as though a sheet of ice had been placed around me to ward off the scorching heat,” the chela\nexplained.\nLahiri Mahasaya performed two miracles in connection with a woman disciple, Abhoya. She and her husband,\na Calcutta lawyer, started one day for Benares to visit the guru. Their carriage was delayed by heavy traffic;\nthey reached the Howrah main station only to hear the Benares train whistling for departure.\nAbhoya, near the ticket office, stood quietly.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 31.

The\nengineer and passengers descended to the platform to view the phenomenon. An English railroad guard\napproached Abhoya and her husband. Contrary to all precedent, he volunteered his services.\n“Babu,” he said, “give me the money. I will buy your tickets while you get aboard.”\nAs soon as the couple was seated and had received the tickets, the train slowly moved forward. In panic, the\nengineer and passengers clambered again to their places, knowing neither how the train started, nor why it had\nstopped in the first place.\nArriving at the home of Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares, Abhoya silently prostrated herself before the master, and\ntried to touch his feet.\n“Compose yourself, Abhoya,” he remarked. “How you love to bother me! As if you could not have come here\nby the next train!”\nAbhoya visited Lahiri Mahasaya on another memorable occasion. This time she wanted his intercession, not\nwith a train, but with the stork.\n“I pray you to bless me that my ninth child may live,” she said. “Eight babies have been born to me; all died\nsoon after birth.”\nThe master smiled sympathetically. “Your coming child will live. Please follow my instructions carefully. The\nbaby, a girl, will be born at night. See that the oil lamp is kept burning until dawn. Do not fall asleep and thus\nallow the light to become extinguished.”\nAbhoya's child was a daughter, born at night, exactly as foreseen by the omniscient guru. The mother\ninstructed her nurse to keep the lamp filled with oil. Both women kept the urgent vigil far into the early\nmorning hours, but finally fell asleep. The lamp oil was almost gone; the light flickered feebly.\nThe bedroom door unlatched and flew open with a violent sound. The startled women awoke. Their\nastonished eyes beheld the form of Lahiri Mahasaya.\n“Abhoya, behold, the light is almost gone!” He pointed to the lamp, which the nurse hastened to refill. As\nsoon as it burned again brightly, the master vanished. The door closed; the latch was affixed without visible\nagency.\nAbhoya's ninth child survived; in 1935, when I made inquiry, she was still living.\nOne of Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples, the venerable Kali Kumar Roy, related to me many fascinating details of\nhis life with the master.\n“I was often a guest at his Benares home for weeks at a time,” Roy told me. “I observed that many saintly\nfigures, DANDA {FN31−3} swamis, arrived in the quiet of night to sit at the guru's feet. Sometimes they\nwould engage in discussion of meditational and philosophical points. At dawn the exalted guests would\ndepart. I found during my visits that Lahiri Mahasaya did not once lie down to sleep.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 31. AN INTERVIEW WITH THE SACRED MOTHER\n166\n"}

'If I ever meet your charlatan guru, I shall give\nhim some words to remember.'\n“This alarming threat failed to interrupt my regular program; I spent nearly every evening in my guru's\npresence. One night my employer followed me and rushed rudely into the parlor. He was doubtless fully bent\non uttering the pulverizing remarks he had promised. No sooner had the man seated himself than Lahiri\nMahasaya addressed the little group of about twelve disciples.\n“'Would you all like to see a picture?'\n“When we nodded, he asked us to darken the room. 'Sit behind one another in a circle,' he said, 'and place\nyour hands over the eyes of the man in front of you.'\n“I was not surprised to see that my employer also was following, albeit unwillingly, the master's directions. In\na few minutes Lahiri Mahasaya asked us what we were seeing.\n“'Sir,' I replied, 'a beautiful woman appears. She wears a red−bordered SARI, and stands near an elephant−ear\nplant.' All the other disciples gave the same description. The master turned to my employer. 'Do you recognize\nthat woman?'\n“'Yes.' The man was evidently struggling with emotions new to his nature. 'I have been foolishly spending my\nmoney on her, though I have a good wife. I am ashamed of the motives which brought me here. Will you\nforgive me, and receive me as a disciple?'\n“'If you lead a good moral life for six months, I shall accept you.' The master enigmatically added, 'Otherwise\nI won't have to initiate you.'\n“For three months my employer refrained from temptation; then he resumed his former relationship with the\nwoman. Two months later he died. Thus I came to understand my guru's veiled prophecy about the\nimprobability of the man's initiation.”\nLahiri Mahasaya had a very famous friend, Swami Trailanga, who was reputed to be over three hundred years\nold. The two yogis often sat together in meditation. Trailanga's fame is so widespread that few Hindus would\ndeny the possibility of truth in any story of his astounding miracles. If Christ returned to earth and walked the\nstreets of New York, displaying his divine powers, it would cause the same excitement that was created by\nTrailanga decades ago as he passed through the crowded lanes of Benares.\nOn many occasions the swami was seen to drink, with no ill effect, the most deadly poisons. Thousands of\npeople, including a few who are still living, have seen Trailanga floating on the Ganges. For days together he\nwould sit on top of the water, or remain hidden for very long periods under the waves. A common sight at the\nBenares bathing GHATS was the swami's motionless body on the blistering stone slabs, wholly exposed to the\nmerciless Indian sun. By these feats Trailanga sought to teach men that a yogi's life does not depend upon\noxygen or ordinary conditions and precautions. Whether he were above water or under it, and whether or not\nhis body lay exposed to the fierce solar rays, the master proved that he lived by divine consciousness: death\ncould not touch him.\nThe yogi was great not only spiritually, but physically. His weight exceeded three hundred pounds: a pound\nfor each year of his life! As he ate very seldom, the mystery is increased. A master, however, easily ignores all\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 31. AN INTERVIEW WITH THE SACRED MOTHER\n167\n"}

Though physical scientists now understand that matter is nothing but congealed energy,\nfully−illumined masters have long passed from theory to practice in the field of matter−control.\nTrailanga always remained completely nude. The harassed police of Benares came to regard him as a baffling\nproblem child. The natural swami, like the early Adam in the garden of Eden, was utterly unconscious of his\nnakedness. The police were quite conscious of it, however, and unceremoniously committed him to jail.\nGeneral embarrassment ensued; the enormous body of Trailanga was soon seen, in its usual entirety, on the\nprison roof. His cell, still securely locked, offered no clue to his mode of escape.\nThe discouraged officers of the law once more performed their duty. This time a guard was posted before the\nswami's cell. Might again retired before right. Trailanga was soon observed in his nonchalant stroll over the\nroof. Justice is blind; the outwitted police decided to follow her example.\nThe great yogi preserved a habitual silence. {FN31−4} In spite of his round face and huge, barrel−like\nstomach, Trailanga ate only occasionally. After weeks without food, he would break his fast with potfuls of\nclabbered milk offered to him by devotees. A skeptic once determined to expose Trailanga as a charlatan. A\nlarge bucket of calcium−lime mixture, used in whitewashing walls, was placed before the swami.\n“Master,” the materialist said, in mock reverence, “I have brought you some clabbered milk. Please drink it.”\nTrailanga unhesitatingly drained, to the last drop, the containerful of burning lime. In a few minutes the\nevildoer fell to the ground in agony.\n“Help, swami, help!” he cried. “I am on fire! Forgive my wicked test!”\nThe great yogi broke his habitual silence. “Scoffer,” he said, “you did not realize when you offered me poison\nthat my life is one with your own. Except for my knowledge that God is present in my stomach, as in every\natom of creation, the lime would have killed me. Now that you know the divine meaning of boomerang, never\nagain play tricks on anyone.”\nThe well−purged sinner, healed by Trailanga's words, slunk feebly away.\nThe reversal of pain was not due to any volition of the master, but came about through unerring application of\nthe law of justice which upholds creation's farthest swinging orb. Men of God−realization like Trailanga allow\nthe divine law to operate instantaneously; they have banished forever all thwarting crosscurrents of ego.\nThe automatic adjustments of righteousness, often paid in an unexpected coin as in the case of Trailanga and\nhis would be murderer, assuage our hasty indignance at human injustice. “Vengeance is mine; I will repay,\nsaith the Lord.” {FN31−5} What need for man's brief resources? the universe duly conspires for retribution.\nDull minds discredit the possibility of divine justice, love, omniscience, immortality. “Airy scriptural\nconjectures!” This insensitive viewpoint, aweless before the cosmic spectacle, arouses a train of events which\nbrings its own awakening.\nThe omnipotence of spiritual law was referred to by Christ on the occasion of his triumphant entry into\nJerusalem. As the disciples and the multitude shouted for joy, and cried, “Peace in heaven, and glory in the\nhighest,” certain Pharisees complained of the undignified spectacle. “Master,” they protested, “rebuke thy\ndisciples.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 31.

As well may you hope to throttle the voice of God,\nwhose very stones sing His glory and His omnipresence. Will you demand that men not celebrate in honor of\nthe peace in heaven, but should only gather together in multitudes to shout for war on earth? Then make your\npreparations, O Pharisees, to overtopple the foundations of the world; for it is not gentle men alone, but stones\nor earth, and water and fire and air that will rise up against you, to bear witness of His ordered harmony.”\nThe grace of the Christlike yogi, Trailanga, was once bestowed on my SAJO MAMA (maternal uncle). One\nmorning Uncle saw the master surrounded by a crowd of devotees at a Benares ghat. He managed to edge his\nway close to Trailanga, whose feet he touched humbly. Uncle was astonished to find himself instantly freed\nfrom a painful chronic disease. {FN31−7}\nThe only known living disciple of the great yogi is a woman, Shankari Mai Jiew.

She has related that one day, in the Barackpur section near\nCalcutta, while she was sitting by Lahiri Mahasaya's side, his great guru Babaji quietly entered the room and\nheld converse with them both.\nOn one occasion her master Trailanga, forsaking his usual silence, honored Lahiri Mahasaya very pointedly in\npublic. A Benares disciple objected.\n“Sir,” he said, “why do you, a swami and a renunciate, show such respect to a householder?”\n“My son,” Trailanga replied, “Lahiri Mahasaya is like a divine kitten, remaining wherever the Cosmic Mother\nhas placed him.

Besides a few of Master's other disciples, I was present with a small group of my Ranchi students.\n“In this passage Jesus calls himself the Son of God. Though he was truly united with God, his reference here\nhas a deep impersonal significance,” my guru explained. “The Son of God is the Christ or Divine\nConsciousness in man. No MORTAL can glorify God. The only honor that man can pay his Creator is to seek\nHim; man cannot glorify an Abstraction that he does not know. The 'glory' or nimbus around the head of the\nsaints is a symbolic witness of their CAPACITY to render divine homage.”\nSri Yukteswar went on to read the marvelous story of Lazarus' resurrection. At its conclusion Master fell into\na long silence, the sacred book open on his knee.\n“I too was privileged to behold a similar miracle.” My guru finally spoke with solemn unction. “Lahiri\nMahasaya resurrected one of my friends from the dead.”\nThe young lads at my side smiled with keen interest. There was enough of the boy in me, too, to enjoy not\nonly the philosophy but, in particular, any story I could get Sri Yukteswar to relate about his wondrous\nexperiences with his guru.\n“My friend Rama and I were inseparable,” Master began. “Because he was shy and reclusive, he chose to visit\nour guru Lahiri Mahasaya only during the hours of midnight and dawn, when the crowd of daytime disciples\nwas absent. As Rama's closest friend, I served as a spiritual vent through which he let out the wealth of his\nspiritual perceptions. I found inspiration in his ideal companionship.” My guru's face softened with memories.\n“Rama was suddenly put to a severe test,” Sri Yukteswar continued. “He contracted the disease of Asiatic\ncholera. As our master never objected to the services of physicians at times of serious illness, two specialists\nwere summoned. Amidst the frantic rush of ministering to the stricken man, I was deeply praying to Lahiri\nMahasaya for help. I hurried to his home and sobbed out the story.\n“'The doctors are seeing Rama. He will be well.' My guru smiled jovially.\n“I returned with a light heart to my friend's bedside, only to find him in a dying state.\n“'He cannot last more than one or two hours,' one of the physicians told me with a gesture of despair. Once\nmore I hastened to Lahiri Mahasaya.\n“'The doctors are conscientious men. I am sure Rama will be well.' The master dismissed me blithely.\n“At Rama's place I found both doctors gone.

He roused\nhimself to cry out:\n“'Yukteswar, run to Master and tell him I am gone. Ask him to bless my body before its last rites.' With these\nwords Rama sighed heavily and gave up the ghost. {FN32−2}\n“I wept for an hour by his beloved form. Always a lover of quiet, now he had attained the utter stillness of\ndeath. Another disciple came in; I asked him to remain in the house until I returned. Half−dazed, I trudged\nback to my guru.\n“'How is Rama now?' Lahiri Mahasaya's face was wreathed in smiles.\n“'Sir, you will soon see how he is,' I blurted out emotionally. 'In a few hours you will see his body, before it is\ncarried to the crematory grounds.' I broke down and moaned openly.\n“'Yukteswar, control yourself. Sit calmly and meditate.' My guru retired into SAMADHI. The afternoon and\nnight passed in unbroken silence; I struggled unsuccessfully to regain an inner composure.\n“At dawn Lahiri Mahasaya glanced at me consolingly. 'I see you are still disturbed. Why didn't you explain\nyesterday that you expected me to give Rama tangible aid in the form of some medicine?' The master pointed\nto a cup−shaped lamp containing crude castor oil. 'Fill a little bottle from the lamp; put seven drops into\nRama's mouth.'\n“'Sir,' I remonstrated, 'he has been dead since yesterday noon. Of what use is the oil now?'\n“'Never mind; just do as I ask.' Lahiri Mahasaya's cheerful mood was incomprehensible; I was still in the\nunassuaged agony of bereavement. Pouring out a small amount of oil, I departed for Rama's house.\n“I found my friend's body rigid in the death−clasp. Paying no attention to his ghastly condition, I opened his\nlips with my right finger and managed, with my left hand and the help of the cork, to put the oil drop by drop\nover his clenched teeth.\n“As the seventh drop touched his cold lips, Rama shivered violently.

'Come with Yukteswar to see me.'“\n“I could scarcely believe my eyes when Rama dressed himself and was strong enough after that fatal sickness\nto walk to the home of our guru. There he prostrated himself before Lahiri Mahasaya with tears of gratitude.\n“The master was beside himself with mirth. His eyes twinkled at me mischievously.\n“'Yukteswar,' he said, 'surely henceforth you will not fail to carry with you a bottle of castor oil! Whenever\nyou see a corpse, just administer the oil! Why, seven drops of lamp oil must surely foil the power of Yama!'\n{FN32−3}\n“'Guruji, you are ridiculing me.

I didn't want to interfere with the physicians; they have to\nlive, too.'

'I know now that your simple word is binding on the whole\ncosmos.'“\nAs Sri Yukteswar finished the awesome story, one of the spellbound listeners ventured a question that, from a\nchild, was doubly understandable.\n“Sir,” he said, “why did your guru use castor oil?”\n“Child, giving the oil had no meaning except that I expected something material and Lahiri Mahasaya chose\nthe near−by oil as an objective symbol for awakening my greater faith. The master allowed Rama to die,\nbecause I had partially doubted. But the divine guru knew that inasmuch as he had said the disciple would be\nwell, the healing must take place, even though he had to cure Rama of death, a disease usually final!”\nSri Yukteswar dismissed the little group, and motioned me to a blanket seat at his feet.\n“Yogananda,” he said with unusual gravity, “you have been surrounded from birth by direct disciples of\nLahiri Mahasaya.

The yogic message will encircle the globe, and aid in establishing that brotherhood of\nman which results from direct perception of the One Father.'\n“My son Yogananda,” Sri Yukteswar went on, “you must do your part in spreading that message, and in\nwriting that sacred life.”\nFifty years after Lahiri Mahasaya's passing in 1895 culminated in 1945, the year of completion of this present\nbook. I cannot but be struck by the coincidence that the year 1945 has also ushered in a new age−the era of\nrevolutionary atomic energies.

If the cosmos is against might, if the sun wars not with the planets but\nretires at dueful time to give the stars their little sway, what avails our mailed fist? Shall any peace indeed\ncome out of it? Not cruelty but good will arms the universal sinews; a humanity at peace will know the\nendless fruits of victory, sweeter to the taste than any nurtured on the soil of blood.\nThe effective League of Nations will be a natural, nameless league of human hearts. The broad sympathies\nand discerning insight needed for the healing of earthly woes cannot flow from a mere intellectual\nconsideration of man's diversities, but from knowledge of man's sole unity−his kinship with God. Toward\nrealization of the world's highest ideal−peace through brotherhood−may yoga, the science of personal contact\nwith the Divine, spread in time to all men in all lands.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 32.

By sheer continuity of being, by intransitivity before the\nages−can dusty scholars truly tell us how many?−India has given the worthiest answer of any people to the\nchallenge of time.\nThe Biblical story {FN32−5} of Abraham's plea to the Lord that the city of Sodom be spared if ten righteous\nmen could be found therein, and the divine reply: “I will not destroy it for ten's sake,” gains new meaning in\nthe light of India's escape from the oblivion of Babylon, Egypt and other mighty nations who were once her\ncontemporaries. The Lord's answer clearly shows that a land lives, not by its material achievements, but in its\nmasterpieces of man.\nLet the divine words be heard again, in this twentieth century, twice dyed in blood ere half over: No nation\nthat can produce ten men, great in the eyes of the Unbribable Judge, shall know extinction. Heeding such\npersuasions, India has proved herself not witless against the thousand cunnings of time. Self−realized masters\nin every century have hallowed her soil; modern Christlike sages, like Lahiri Mahasaya and his disciple Sri\nYukteswar, rise up to proclaim that the science of yoga is more vital than any material advances to man's\nhappiness and to a nation's longevity.\nVery scanty information about the life of Lahiri Mahasaya and his universal doctrine has ever appeared in\nprint. For three decades in India, America, and Europe, I have found a deep and sincere interest in his message\nof liberating yoga; a written account of the master's life, even as he foretold, is now needed in the West, where\nlives of the great modern yogis are little known.\nNothing but one or two small pamphlets in English has been written on the guru's life. One biography in\nBengali, SRI SRI {FN32−6} SHYAMA CHARAN LAHIRI MAHASAYA, appeared in 1941. It was written\nby my disciple, Swami Satyananda, who for many years has been the ACHARYA (spiritual preceptor) at our\nVIDYALAYA in Ranchi. I have translated a few passages from his book and have incorporated them into this\nsection devoted to Lahiri Mahasaya.\nIt was into a pious Brahmin family of ancient lineage that Lahiri Mahasaya was born September 30, 1828. His\nbirthplace was the village of Ghurni in the Nadia district near Krishnagar, Bengal. He was the youngest son of\nMuktakashi, the second wife of the esteemed Gaur Mohan Lahiri. (His first wife, after the birth of three sons,\nhad died during a pilgrimage.) The boy's mother passed away during his childhood; little about her is known\nexcept the revealing fact that she was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva, {FN32−7} scripturally designated as\nthe “King of Yogis.”\nThe boy Lahiri, whose given name was Shyama Charan, spent his early years in the ancestral home at Nadia.\nAt the age of three or four he was often observed sitting under the sands in the posture of a yogi, his body\ncompletely hidden except for the head.\nThe Lahiri estate was destroyed in the winter of 1833, when the nearby Jalangi River changed its course and\ndisappeared into the depths of the Ganges. One of the Shiva temples founded by the Lahiris went into the river\nalong with the family home. A devotee rescued the stone image of Lord Shiva from the swirling waters and\nplaced it in a new temple, now well−known as the Ghurni Shiva Site.\nGaur Mohan Lahiri and his family left Nadia and became residents of Benares, where the father immediately\nerected a Shiva temple. He conducted his household along the lines of Vedic discipline, with regular\nobservance of ceremonial worship, acts of charity, and scriptural study. Just and open−minded, however, he\ndid not ignore the beneficial current of modern ideas.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 32. RAMA IS RAISED FROM THE DEAD\n173\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 177, "text": "The boy Lahiri took lessons in Hindi and Urdu in Benares study−groups. He attended a school conducted by\nJoy Narayan Ghosal, receiving instruction in Sanskrit, Bengali, French, and English. Applying himself to a\nclose study of the VEDAS, the young yogi listened eagerly to scriptural discussions by learned Brahmins,\nincluding a Marhatta pundit named Nag−Bhatta.\nShyama Charan was a kind, gentle, and courageous youth, beloved by all his companions. With a\nwell−proportioned, bright, and powerful body, he excelled in swimming and in many skillful activities.\nIn 1846 Shyama Charan Lahiri was married to Srimati Kashi Moni, daughter of Sri Debnarayan Sanyal. A\nmodel Indian housewife, Kashi Moni cheerfully carried on her home duties and the traditional householder's\nobligation to serve guests and the poor. Two saintly sons, Tincouri and Ducouri, blessed the union.\nAt the age of 23, in 1851, Lahiri Mahasaya took the post of accountant in the Military Engineering\nDepartment of the English government. He received many promotions during the time of his service. Thus not\nonly was he a master before God's eyes, but also a success in the little human drama where he played his\ngiven role as an office worker in the world.\nAs the offices of the Army Department were shifted, Lahiri Mahasaya was transferred to Gazipur, Mirjapur,\nDanapur, Naini Tal, Benares, and other localities. After the death of his father, Lahiri had to assume the entire\nresponsibility of his family, for whom he bought a quiet residence in the Garudeswar Mohulla neighborhood\nof Benares.\nIt was in his thirty−third year that Lahiri Mahasaya saw fulfillment of the purpose for which he had been\nreincarnated on earth. The ash−hidden flame, long smouldering, received its opportunity to burst into flame. A\ndivine decree, resting beyond the gaze of human beings, works mysteriously to bring all things into outer\nmanifestation at the proper time. He met his great guru, Babaji, near Ranikhet, and was initiated by him into\nKRIYA YOGA.\nThis auspicious event did not happen to him alone; it was a fortunate moment for all the human race, many of\nwhom were later privileged to receive the soul−awakening gift of KRIYA. The lost, or long−vanished, highest\nart of yoga was again being brought to light. Many spiritually thirsty men and women eventually found their\nway to the cool waters of KRIYA YOGA. Just as in the Hindu legend, where Mother Ganges offers her divine\ndraught to the parched devotee Bhagirath, so the celestial flood of KRIYA rolled from the secret fastnesses of\nthe Himalayas into the dusty haunts of men.\n{FN32−1} JOHN 11:1−4.\n{FN32−2} A cholera victim is often rational and fully conscious right up to the moment of death.\n{FN32−3} The god of death.\n{FN32−4} Literally, “Supreme soul.”\n{FN32−5} GENESIS 18:23−32.\n{FN32−6} SRI, a prefix meaning “holy,” is attached (generally twice or thrice) to names of great Indian\nteachers.\n{FN32−7} One of the trinity of Godhead−Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva−whose universal work is, respectively, that\nof creation, preservation, and dissolution−restoration.

BABAJI, THE YOGI−CHRIST OF MODERN INDIA\nThe northern Himalayan crags near Badrinarayan are still blessed by the living presence of Babaji, guru of\nLahiri Mahasaya. The secluded master has retained his physical form for centuries, perhaps for millenniums.\nThe deathless Babaji is an AVATARA. This Sanskrit word means “descent”; its roots are AVA, “down,” and\nTRI, “to pass.” In the Hindu scriptures, AVATARA signifies the descent of Divinity into flesh.\n“Babaji's spiritual state is beyond human comprehension,” Sri Yukteswar explained to me. “The dwarfed\nvision of men cannot pierce to his transcendental star. One attempts in vain even to picture the avatar's\nattainment. It is inconceivable.”\nThe UPANISHADS have minutely classified every stage of spiritual advancement. A SIDDHA (“perfected\nbeing\") has progressed from the state of a JIVANMUKTA (“freed while living\") to that of a PARAMUKTA\n(“supremely free\"−full power over death); the latter has completely escaped from the mayic thralldom and its\nreincarnational round. The PARAMUKTA therefore seldom returns to a physical body; if he does, he is an\navatar, a divinely appointed medium of supernal blessings on the world.\nAn avatar is unsubject to the universal economy; his pure body, visible as a light image, is free from any debt\nto nature. The casual gaze may see nothing extraordinary in an avatar's form but it casts no shadow nor makes\nany footprint on the ground. These are outward symbolic proofs of an inward lack of darkness and material\nbondage. Such a God−man alone knows the Truth behind the relativities of life and death. Omar Khayyam, so\ngrossly misunderstood, sang of this liberated man in his immortal scripture, the RUBAIYAT:\n“Ah, Moon of my Delight who know'st no wane, The Moon of Heav'n is rising once again; How oft hereafter\nrising shall she look Through this same Garden after me−in vain!”\nThe “Moon of Delight” is God, eternal Polaris, anachronous never. The “Moon of Heav'n” is the outward\ncosmos, fettered to the law of periodic recurrence. Its chains had been dissolved forever by the Persian seer\nthrough his self−realization. “How oft hereafter rising shall she look . . . after me−in vain!” What frustration\nof search by a frantic universe for an absolute omission!\nChrist expressed his freedom in another way: “And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will\nfollow thee whithersoever thou goest. And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air\nhave nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.” {FN33−1}\nSpacious with omnipresence, could Christ indeed be followed except in the overarching Spirit?\nKrishna, Rama, Buddha, and Patanjali were among the ancient Indian avatars. A considerable poetic literature\nin Tamil has grown up around Agastya, a South Indian avatar. He worked many miracles during the centuries\npreceding and following the Christian era, and is credited with retaining his physical form even to this day.\nBabaji's mission in India has been to assist prophets in carrying out their special dispensations. He thus\nqualifies for the scriptural classification of MAHAVATAR (Great Avatar). He has stated that he gave yoga\ninitiation to Shankara, ancient founder of the Swami Order, and to Kabir, famous medieval saint. His chief\nnineteenth−century disciple was, as we know, Lahiri Mahasaya, revivalist of the lost KRIYA art.\n[Illustration: BABAJI, THE MAHAVATAR, Guru of Lahiri Mahasaya, I have helped an artist to draw a true\nlikeness of the great Yogi−Christ of modern India.—see babaji.jpg]\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 33.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 179, "text": "The MAHAVATAR is in constant communion with Christ; together they send out vibrations of redemption,\nand have planned the spiritual technique of salvation for this age. The work of these two fully−illumined\nmasters−one with the body, and one without it−is to inspire the nations to forsake suicidal wars, race hatreds,\nreligious sectarianism, and the boomerang−evils of materialism. Babaji is well aware of the trend of modern\ntimes, especially of the influence and complexities of Western civilization, and realizes the necessity of\nspreading the self−liberations of yoga equally in the West and in the East.\nThat there is no historical reference to Babaji need not surprise us. The great guru has never openly appeared\nin any century; the misinterpreting glare of publicity has no place in his millennial plans. Like the Creator, the\nsole but silent Power, Babaji works in a humble obscurity.\nGreat prophets like Christ and Krishna come to earth for a specific and spectacular purpose; they depart as\nsoon as it is accomplished. Other avatars, like Babaji, undertake work which is concerned more with the slow\nevolutionary progress of man during the centuries than with any one outstanding event of history. Such\nmasters always veil themselves from the gross public gaze, and have the power to become invisible at will.\nFor these reasons, and because they generally instruct their disciples to maintain silence about them, a number\nof towering spiritual figures remain world−unknown. I give in these pages on Babaji merely a hint of his\nlife−only a few facts which he deems it fit and helpful to be publicly imparted.\nNo limiting facts about Babaji's family or birthplace, dear to the annalist's heart, have ever been discovered.\nHis speech is generally in Hindi, but he converses easily in any language. He has adopted the simple name of\nBabaji (revered father); other titles of respect given him by Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples are Mahamuni Babaji\nMaharaj (supreme ecstatic saint), Maha Yogi (greatest of yogis), Trambak Baba and Shiva Baba (titles of\navatars of Shiva). Does it matter that we know not the patronymic of an earth−released master?\n“Whenever anyone utters with reverence the name of Babaji,” Lahiri Mahasaya said, “that devotee attracts an\ninstant spiritual blessing.”\nThe deathless guru bears no marks of age on his body; he appears to be no more than a youth of twenty−five.\nFair−skinned, of medium build and height, Babaji's beautiful, strong body radiates a perceptible glow. His\neyes are dark, calm, and tender; his long, lustrous hair is copper−colored. A very strange fact is that Babaji\nbears an extraordinarily exact resemblance to his disciple Lahiri Mahasaya. The similarity is so striking that,\nin his later years, Lahiri Mahasaya might have passed as the father of the youthful−looking Babaji.\nSwami Kebalananda, my saintly Sanskrit tutor, spent some time with Babaji in the Himalayas.\n“The peerless master moves with his group from place to place in the mountains,” Kebalananda told me. “His\nsmall band contains two highly advanced American disciples. After Babaji has been in one locality for some\ntime, he says: 'DERA DANDA UTHAO.' ('Let us lift our camp and staff.') He carries a symbolic DANDA\n(bamboo staff). His words are the signal for moving with his group instantaneously to another place. He does\nnot always employ this method of astral travel; sometimes he goes on foot from peak to peak.\n“Babaji can be seen or recognized by others only when he so desires. He is known to have appeared in many\nslightly different forms to various devotees−sometimes without beard and moustache, and sometimes with\nthem. As his undecaying body requires no food, the master seldom eats. As a social courtesy to visiting\ndisciples, he occasionally accepts fruits, or rice cooked in milk and clarified butter.\n“Two amazing incidents of Babaji's life are known to me,” Kebalananda went on. “His disciples were sitting\none night around a huge fire which was blazing for a sacred Vedic ceremony. The master suddenly seized a\nburning log and lightly struck the bare shoulder of a chela who was close to the fire.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 33.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 180, "text": "“'Sir, how cruel!' Lahiri Mahasaya, who was present, made this remonstrance.\n“'Would you rather have seen him burned to ashes before your eyes, according to the decree of his past\nkarma?'\n“With these words Babaji placed his healing hand on the chela's disfigured shoulder. 'I have freed you tonight\nfrom painful death. The karmic law has been satisfied through your slight suffering by fire.'\n“On another occasion Babaji's sacred circle was disturbed by the arrival of a stranger. He had climbed with\nastonishing skill to the nearly inaccessible ledge near the camp of the master.\n“'Sir, you must be the great Babaji.' The man's face was lit with inexpressible reverence. 'For months I have\npursued a ceaseless search for you among these forbidding crags. I implore you to accept me as a disciple.'\n“When the great guru made no response, the man pointed to the rocky chasm at his feet.\n“'If you refuse me, I will jump from this mountain. Life has no further value if I cannot win your guidance to\nthe Divine.'\n“'Jump then,' Babaji said unemotionally. 'I cannot accept you in your present state of development.'\n“The man immediately hurled himself over the cliff. Babaji instructed the shocked disciples to fetch the\nstranger's body. When they returned with the mangled form, the master placed his divine hand on the dead\nman. Lo! he opened his eyes and prostrated himself humbly before the omnipotent one.\n“'You are now ready for discipleship.' Babaji beamed lovingly on his resurrected chela. 'You have\ncourageously passed a difficult test. Death shall not touch you again; now you are one of our immortal flock.'\nThen he spoke his usual words of departure, 'DERA DANDA UTHAO'; the whole group vanished from the\nmountain.”\nAn avatar lives in the omnipresent Spirit; for him there is no distance inverse to the square. Only one reason,\ntherefore, can motivate Babaji in maintaining his physical form from century to century: the desire to furnish\nhumanity with a concrete example of its own possibilities. Were man never vouchsafed a glimpse of Divinity\nin the flesh, he would remain oppressed by the heavy mayic delusion that he cannot transcend his mortality.\nJesus knew from the beginning the sequence of his life; he passed through each event not for himself, not\nfrom any karmic compulsion, but solely for the upliftment of reflective human beings. His four\nreporter−disciples−Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John−recorded the ineffable drama for the benefit of later\ngenerations.\nFor Babaji, also, there is no relativity of past, present, future; from the beginning he has known all phases of\nhis life. Yet, accommodating himself to the limited understanding of men, he has played many acts of his\ndivine life in the presence of one or more witnesses. Thus it came about that a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya\nwas present when Babaji deemed the time to be ripe for him to proclaim the possibility of bodily immortality.\nHe uttered this promise before Ram Gopal Muzumdar, that it might finally become known for the inspiration\nof other seeking hearts. The great ones speak their words and participate in the seemingly natural course of\nevents, solely for the good of man, even as Christ said: “Father . . . I knew that thou hearest me always: but\nBECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE WHICH STAND BY I SAID IT, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.”\n{FN33−2} During my visit at Ranbajpur with Ram Gopal, “the sleepless saint,” {FN33−3} he related the\nwondrous story of his first meeting with Babaji.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 33.

The night was bright with moonlight and the glittering stars. After I had sat\nin patient silence for awhile, my attention was drawn to a huge stone slab near my feet. It rose gradually,\nrevealing an underground cave. As the stone remained balanced in some unknown manner, the draped form of\na young and surpassingly lovely woman was levitated from the cave high into the air. Surrounded by a soft\nhalo, she slowly descended in front of me and stood motionless, steeped in an inner state of ecstasy. She\nfinally stirred, and spoke gently.\n“'I am Mataji, {FN33−4} the sister of Babaji. I have asked him and also Lahiri Mahasaya to come to my cave\ntonight to discuss a matter of great importance.'\n“A nebulous light was rapidly floating over the Ganges; the strange luminescence was reflected in the opaque\nwaters. It approached nearer and nearer until, with a blinding flash, it appeared by the side of Mataji and\ncondensed itself instantly into the human form of Lahiri Mahasaya. He bowed humbly at the feet of the\nwoman saint.\n“Before I had recovered from my bewilderment, I was further wonderstruck to behold a circling mass of\nmystical light traveling in the sky. Descending swiftly, the flaming whirlpool neared our group and\nmaterialized itself into the body of a beautiful youth who, I understood at once, was Babaji. He looked like\nLahiri Mahasaya, the only difference being that Babaji appeared much younger, and had long, bright hair.\n“Lahiri Mahasaya, Mataji, and myself knelt at the guru's feet. An ethereal sensation of beatific glory thrilled\nevery fiber of my being as I touched his divine flesh.\n“'Blessed sister,' Babaji said, 'I am intending to shed my form and plunge into the Infinite Current.'\n“'I have already glimpsed your plan, beloved master. I wanted to discuss it with you tonight. Why should you\nleave your body?' The glorious woman looked at him beseechingly.\n“'What is the difference if I wear a visible or invisible wave on the ocean of my Spirit?'\n“Mataji replied with a quaint flash of wit. 'Deathless guru, if it makes no difference, then please do not ever\nrelinquish your form.' {FN33−5}\n“'Be it so,' Babaji said solemnly. 'I will never leave my physical body. It will always remain visible to at least\na small number of people on this earth. The Lord has spoken His own wish through your lips.'\n“As I listened in awe to the conversation between these exalted beings, the great guru turned to me with a\nbenign gesture.\n“'Fear not, Ram Gopal,' he said, 'you are blessed to be a witness at the scene of this immortal promise.'\n“As the sweet melody of Babaji's voice faded away, his form and that of Lahiri Mahasaya slowly levitated and\nmoved backward over the Ganges. An aureole of dazzling light templed their bodies as they vanished into the\nnight sky. Mataji's form floated to the cave and descended; the stone slab closed of itself, as if working on an\ninvisible leverage.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 33.

My own, do you now understand?'\n“'My guru, what can I say?' I murmured brokenly. 'Where has one ever heard of such deathless love?' I gazed\nlong and ecstatically on my eternal treasure, my guru in life and death.\n“'Lahiri, you need purification. Drink the oil in this bowl and lie down by the river.' Babaji's practical wisdom,\nI reflected with a quick, reminiscent smile, was ever to the fore.\n“I obeyed his directions. Though the icy Himalayan night was descending, a comforting warmth, an inner\nradiation, began to pulsate in every cell of my body. I marveled. Was the unknown oil endued with a cosmical\nheat?\n“Bitter winds whipped around me in the darkness, shrieking a fierce challenge. The chill wavelets of the\nGogash River lapped now and then over my body, outstretched on the rocky bank. Tigers howled near−by,\nbut my heart was free of fear; the radiant force newly generated within me conveyed an assurance of\nunassailable protection. Several hours passed swiftly; faded memories of another life wove themselves into\nthe present brilliant pattern of reunion with my divine guru.\n“My solitary musings were interrupted by the sound of approaching footsteps. In the darkness, a man's hand\ngently helped me to my feet, and gave me some dry clothing.\n“'Come, brother,' my companion said. 'The master awaits you.'\n“He led the way through the forest. The somber night was suddenly lit by a steady luminosity in the distance.\n“'Can that be the sunrise?' I inquired. 'Surely the whole night has not passed?'\n“'The hour is midnight.' My guide laughed softly. 'Yonder light is the glow of a golden palace, materialized\nhere tonight by the peerless Babaji. In the dim past, you once expressed a desire to enjoy the beauties of a\npalace. Our master is now satisfying your wish, thus freeing you from the bonds of karma.' {FN34−4} He\nadded, 'The magnificent palace will be the scene of your initiation tonight into KRIYA YOGA. All your\nbrothers here join in a paean of welcome, rejoicing at the end of your long exile. Behold!'\n“A vast palace of dazzling gold stood before us. Studded with countless jewels, and set amidst landscaped\ngardens, it presented a spectacle of unparalleled grandeur. Saints of angelic countenance were stationed by\nresplendent gates, half−reddened by the glitter of rubies. Diamonds, pearls, sapphires, and emeralds of great\nsize and luster were imbedded in the decorative arches.\n“I followed my companion into a spacious reception hall. The odor of incense and of roses wafted through the\nair; dim lamps shed a multicolored glow. Small groups of devotees, some fair, some dark−skinned, chanted\nmusically, or sat in the meditative posture, immersed in an inner peace. A vibrant joy pervaded the\natmosphere.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 34. MATERIALIZING A PALACE IN THE HIMALAYAS\n181\n"}

My guide smiled sympathetically as I uttered a few ejaculations of wonderment.\n“'Brother,' I said, 'the beauty of this structure surpasses the bounds of human imagination. Please tell me the\nmystery of its origin.'\n“'I will gladly enlighten you.' My companion's dark eyes sparkled with wisdom. 'In reality there is nothing\ninexplicable about this materialization. The whole cosmos is a materialized thought of the Creator. This\nheavy, earthly clod, floating in space, is a dream of God. He made all things out of His consciousness, even as\nman in his dream consciousness reproduces and vivifies a creation with its creatures.\n“'God first created the earth as an idea. Then He quickened it; energy atoms came into being. He coordinated\nthe atoms into this solid sphere. All its molecules are held together by the will of God. When He withdraws\nHis will, the earth again will disintegrate into energy. Energy will dissolve into consciousness; the earth−idea\nwill disappear from objectivity.\n“'The substance of a dream is held in materialization by the subconscious thought of the dreamer. When that\ncohesive thought is withdrawn in wakefulness, the dream and its elements dissolve. A man closes his eyes and\nerects a dream−creation which, on awakening, he effortlessly dematerializes. He follows the divine archetypal\npattern. Similarly, when he awakens in cosmic consciousness, he will effortlessly dematerialize the illusions\nof the cosmic dream.\n“'Being one with the infinite all−accomplishing Will, Babaji can summon the elemental atoms to combine and\nmanifest themselves in any form. This golden palace, instantaneously created, is real, even as this earth is real.\nBabaji created this palatial mansion out of his mind and is holding its atoms together by the power of his will,\neven as God created this earth and is maintaining it intact.' He added, 'When this structure has served its\npurpose, Babaji will dematerialize it.'\n“As I remained silent in awe, my guide made a sweeping gesture. 'This shimmering palace, superbly\nembellished with jewels, has not been built by human effort or with laboriously mined gold and gems. It\nstands solidly, a monumental challenge to man. {FN34−5} Whoever realizes himself as a son of God, even as\nBabaji has done, can reach any goal by the infinite powers hidden within him. A common stone locks within\nitself the secret of stupendous atomic energy; {FN34−6} even so, a mortal is yet a powerhouse of divinity.'\n“The sage picked up from a near−by table a graceful vase whose handle was blazing with diamonds. 'Our\ngreat guru created this palace by solidifying myriads of free cosmic rays,' he went on. 'Touch this vase and its\ndiamonds; they will satisfy all the tests of sensory experience.'\n“I examined the vase, and passed my hand over the smooth room−walls, thick with glistening gold. Each of\nthe jewels scattered lavishly about was worthy of a king's collection. Deep satisfaction spread over my mind.\nA submerged desire, hidden in my subconsciousness from lives now gone, seemed simultaneously gratified\nand extinguished.\n“My stately companion led me through ornate arches and corridors into a series of chambers richly furnished\nin the style of an emperor's palace. We entered an immense hall. In the center stood a golden throne, encrusted\nwith jewels shedding a dazzling medley of colors. There, in lotus posture, sat the supreme Babaji. I knelt on\nthe shining floor at his feet.\n“'Lahiri, are you still feasting on your dream desires for a golden palace?' My guru's eyes were twinkling like\nhis own sapphires. 'Wake! All your earthly thirsts are about to be quenched forever.' He murmured some\nmystic words of blessing. 'My son, arise.

I\nreceived the liberating yogic technique before this flaming altar.\n“The rites were completed in the early dawn. I felt no need for sleep in my ecstatic state, and wandered around\nthe palace, filled on all sides with treasures and priceless OBJETS D'ART. Descending to the gorgeous\ngardens, I noticed, near−by, the same caves and barren mountain ledges which yesterday had boasted no\nadjacency to palace or flowered terrace.\n“Reentering the palace, fabulously glistening in the cold Himalayan sunlight, I sought the presence of my\nmaster. He was still enthroned, surrounded by many quiet disciples.\n“'Lahiri, you are hungry.'

My own body\nand the forms of Babaji and the cluster of chelas were all now seated on the bare ground at the exact site of\nthe vanished palace, not far from the sunlit entrances of the rocky grottos. I recalled that my guide had\nremarked that the palace would be dematerialized, its captive atoms released into the thought−essence from\nwhich it had sprung. Although stunned, I looked trustingly at my guru. I knew not what to expect next on this\nday of miracles.\n“'The purpose for which the palace was created has now been served,' Babaji explained. He lifted an earthen\nvessel from the ground. 'Put your hand there and receive whatever food you desire.'\n“As soon as I touched the broad, empty bowl, it became heaped with hot butter−fried LUCHIS, curry, and\nrare sweetmeats. I helped myself, observing that the vessel was ever−filled. At the end of my meal I looked\naround for water. My guru pointed to the bowl before me. Lo! the food had vanished; in its place was water,\nclear as from a mountain stream.\n“'Few mortals know that the kingdom of God includes the kingdom of mundane fulfillments,' Babaji\nobserved. 'The divine realm extends to the earthly, but the latter, being illusory, cannot include the essence of\nreality.'\n“'Beloved guru, last night you demonstrated for me the link of beauty in heaven and earth!' I smiled at\nmemories of the vanished palace; surely no simple yogi had ever received initiation into the august mysteries\nof Spirit amidst surroundings of more impressive luxury! I gazed tranquilly at the stark contrast of the present\nscene. The gaunt ground, the skyey roof, the caves offering primitive shelter−all seemed a gracious natural\nsetting for the seraphic saints around me.\n“I sat that afternoon on my blanket, hallowed by associations of past−life realizations. My divine guru\napproached and passed his hand over my head. I entered the NIRBIKALPA SAMADHI state, remaining\nunbrokenly in its bliss for seven days. Crossing the successive strata of self−knowledge, I penetrated the\ndeathless realms of reality. All delusive limitations dropped away; my soul was fully established on the\neternal altar of the Cosmic Spirit. On the eighth day I fell at my guru's feet and implored him to keep me\nalways near him in this sacred wilderness.\n“'My son,' Babaji said, embracing me, 'your role in this incarnation must be played on an outward stage.\nPrenatally blessed by many lives of lonely meditation, you must now mingle in the world of men.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 34.

'You have been chosen to bring spiritual solace through KRIYA YOGA to numerous\nearnest seekers. The millions who are encumbered by family ties and heavy worldly duties will take new heart\nfrom you, a householder like themselves.

'If I call him, my guru will appear right in\nthis house.'\n“Interest gleamed in every eye; it was no wonder that the group was eager to behold a saint materialized in\nsuch a strange way.

There\nwas a sudden flash; we witnessed the instantaneous dechemicalization of the electronic elements of Babaji's\nbody into a spreading vaporous light. The God−tuned will power of the master had loosened its grasp of the\nether atoms held together as his body; forthwith the trillions of tiny lifetronic sparks faded into the infinite\nreservoir.\n“'With my own eyes I have seen the conqueror of death.'

'Sir, what are you doing here?'\n“'I am washing the feet of this renunciate, and then I shall clean his cooking utensils.'

THE CHRISTLIKE LIFE OF LAHIRI MAHASAYA\n“Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.” {FN35−1} In these words to John the Baptist, and in asking\nJohn to baptize him, Jesus was acknowledging the divine rights of his guru.\nFrom a reverent study of the Bible from an Oriental viewpoint, {FN35−2} and from intuitional perception, I\nam convinced that John the Baptist was, in past lives, the guru of Christ. There are numerous passages in the\nBible which infer that John and Jesus in their last incarnations were, respectively, Elijah and his disciple\nElisha. (These are the spellings in the Old Testament. The Greek translators spelled the names as Elias and\nEliseus; they reappear in the New Testament in these changed forms.)\nThe very end of the Old Testament is a prediction of the reincarnation of Elijah and Elisha: “Behold, I will\nsend you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.” {FN35−3} Thus\nJohn (Elijah), sent “before the coming . . . of the Lord,” was born slightly earlier to serve as a herald for\nChrist. An angel appeared to Zacharias the father to testify that his coming son John would be no other than\nElijah (Elias).\n“But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear\nthee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. . . . And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord\ntheir God. And he shall go before him {FN35−4} IN THE SPIRIT AND POWER OF ELIAS, to turn the\nhearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people\nprepared for the Lord.” {FN35−5} Jesus twice unequivocally identified Elijah (Elias) as John: “Elias is come\nalready, and they knew him not. . . . Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the\nBaptist.” {FN35−6} Again, Christ says: “For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. And if ye will\nreceive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.” {FN35−7} When John denied that he was Elias (Elijah),\n{FN35−8} he meant that in the humble garb of John he came no longer in the outward elevation of Elijah the\ngreat guru. In his former incarnation he had given the “mantle” of his glory and his spiritual wealth to his\ndisciple Elisha. “And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. And he said, Thou\nhast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee. . . .\nAnd he took the MANTLE of Elijah that fell from him.” {FN35−9}\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 35.

Some of them that stood\nthere, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. . . .

With tender solicitude the deathless guru swam the Lethean waters that swirled between the\nlast two lives of his chela, and guided the successive steps taken by the child and then by the man Lahiri\nMahasaya. It was not until the disciple had reached his thirty−third year that Babaji deemed the time to be ripe\nto openly reestablish the never−severed link. Then, after their brief meeting near Ranikhet, the selfless master\nbanished his dearly−beloved disciple from the little mountain group, releasing him for an outward world\nmission. “My son, I shall come whenever you need me.” What mortal lover can bestow that infinite promise?\nUnknown to society in general, a great spiritual renaissance began to flow from a remote corner of Benares.\nJust as the fragrance of flowers cannot be suppressed, so Lahiri Mahasaya, quietly living as an ideal\nhouseholder, could not hide his innate glory. Slowly, from every part of India, the devotee−bees sought the\ndivine nectar of the liberated master.\nThe English office superintendent was one of the first to notice a strange transcendental change in his\nemployee, whom he endearingly called “Ecstatic Babu.”\n“Sir, you seem sad. What is the trouble?” Lahiri Mahasaya made this sympathetic inquiry one morning to his\nemployer.\n“My wife in England is critically ill. I am torn by anxiety.”\n“I shall get you some word about her.” Lahiri Mahasaya left the room and sat for a short time in a secluded\nspot. On his return he smiled consolingly.\n“Your wife is improving; she is now writing you a letter.” The omniscient yogi quoted some parts of the\nmissive.\n“Ecstatic Babu, I already know that you are no ordinary man. Yet I am unable to believe that, at will, you can\nbanish time and space!”\nThe promised letter finally arrived. The astounded superintendent found that it contained not only the good\nnews of his wife's recovery, but also the same phrases which, weeks earlier, Lahiri Mahasaya had repeated.\nThe wife came to India some months later. She visited the office, where Lahiri Mahasaya was quietly sitting\nat his desk. The woman approached him reverently.\n“Sir,” she said, “it was your form, haloed in glorious light, that I beheld months ago by my sickbed in London.\nAt that moment I was completely healed! Soon after, I was able to undertake the long ocean voyage to India.”\nDay after day, one or two devotees besought the sublime guru for KRIYA initiation. In addition to these\nspiritual duties, and to those of his business and family life, the great master took an enthusiastic interest in\neducation. He organized many study groups, and played an active part in the growth of a large high school in\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 35. THE CHRISTLIKE LIFE OF LAHIRI MAHASAYA\n188\n"}

Earning only a\nmodest salary, thrifty, unostentatious, accessible to all, the master carried on naturally and happily in the path\nof worldly life.\nThough ensconced in the seat of the Supreme One, Lahiri Mahasaya showed reverence to all men, irrespective\nof their differing merits. When his devotees saluted him, he bowed in turn to them. With a childlike humility,\nthe master often touched the feet of others, but seldom allowed them to pay him similar honor, even though\nsuch obeisance toward the guru is an ancient Oriental custom.\nA significant feature of Lahiri Mahasaya's life was his gift of KRIYA initiation to those of every faith. Not\nHindus only, but Moslems and Christians were among his foremost disciples. Monists and dualists, those of\nall faiths or of no established faith, were impartially received and instructed by the universal guru. One of his\nhighly advanced chelas was Abdul Gufoor Khan, a Mohammedan. It shows great courage on the part of Lahiri\nMahasaya that, although a high−caste Brahmin, he tried his utmost to dissolve the rigid caste bigotry of his\ntime. Those from every walk of life found shelter under the master's omnipresent wings. Like all\nGod−inspired prophets, Lahiri Mahasaya gave new hope to the outcastes and down−trodden of society.\n“Always remember that you belong to no one, and no one belongs to you. Reflect that some day you will\nsuddenly have to leave everything in this world−so make the acquaintanceship of God now,” the great guru\ntold his disciples. “Prepare yourself for the coming astral journey of death by daily riding in the balloon of\nGod−perception. Through delusion you are perceiving yourself as a bundle of flesh and bones, which at best\nis a nest of troubles. {FN35−12} Meditate unceasingly, that you may quickly behold yourself as the Infinite\nEssence, free from every form of misery. Cease being a prisoner of the body; using the secret key of KRIYA,\nlearn to escape into Spirit.”\nThe great guru encouraged his various students to adhere to the good traditional discipline of their own faith.\nStressing the all−inclusive nature of KRIYA as a practical technique of liberation, Lahiri Mahasaya then gave\nhis chelas liberty to express their lives in conformance with environment and up bringing.\n“A Moslem should perform his NAMAJ {FN35−13} worship four times daily,” the master pointed out. “Four\ntimes daily a Hindu should sit in meditation. A Christian should go down on his knees four times daily,\npraying to God and then reading the Bible.”\nWith wise discernment the guru guided his followers into the paths of BHAKTI (devotion), KARMA (action),\nJNANA (wisdom), or RAJA (royal or complete) YOGAS, according to each man's natural tendencies. The\nmaster, who was slow to give his permission to devotees wishing to enter the formal path of monkhood,\nalways cautioned them to first reflect well on the austerities of the monastic life.\nThe great guru taught his disciples to avoid theoretical discussion of the scriptures. “He only is wise who\ndevotes himself to realizing, not reading only, the ancient revelations,” he said. “Solve all your problems\nthrough meditation. {FN35−14} Exchange unprofitable religious speculations for actual God−contact. Clear\nyour mind of dogmatic theological debris; let in the fresh, healing waters of direct perception. Attune yourself\nto the active inner Guidance; the Divine Voice has the answer to every dilemma of life. Though man's\ningenuity for getting himself into trouble appears to be endless, the Infinite Succor is no less resourceful.”\n[Illustration: LAHIRI MAHASAYA, Disciple of Babaji and Guru of Sri Yukteswar—see lahiri.jpg]\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 35.

As he was explaining the meaning of KUTASTHA CHAITANYA or\nthe Christ Consciousness in all vibratory creation, Lahiri Mahasaya suddenly gasped and cried out:\n“I am drowning in the bodies of many souls off the coast of Japan!”\nThe next morning the chelas read a newspaper account of the death of many people whose ship had foundered\nthe preceding day near Japan.\nThe distant disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya were often made aware of his enfolding presence. “I am ever with\nthose who practice KRIYA,” he said consolingly to chelas who could not remain near him. “I will guide you\nto the Cosmic Home through your enlarging perceptions.”\nSwami Satyananda was told by a devotee that, unable to go to Benares, the man had nevertheless received\nprecise KRIYA initiation in a dream. Lahiri Mahasaya had appeared to instruct the chela in answer to his\nprayers.\nIf a disciple neglected any of his worldly obligations, the master would gently correct and discipline him.\n“Lahiri Mahasaya's words were mild and healing, even when he was forced to speak openly of a chela's\nfaults,” Sri Yukteswar once told me. He added ruefully, “No disciple ever fled from our master's barbs.” I\ncould not help laughing, but I truthfully assured Sri Yukteswar that, sharp or not, his every word was music to\nmy ears.\nLahiri Mahasaya carefully graded KRIYA into four progressive initiations. {FN35−15} He bestowed the three\nhigher techniques only after the devotee had manifested definite spiritual progress. One day a certain chela,\nconvinced that his worth was not being duly evaluated, gave voice to his discontent.\n“Master,” he said, “surely I am ready now for the second initiation.”\nAt this moment the door opened to admit a humble disciple, Brinda Bhagat. He was a Benares postman.\n“Brinda, sit by me here.” The great guru smiled at him affectionately. “Tell me, are you ready for the second\ntechnique of KRIYA?”\nThe little postman folded his hands in supplication. “Gurudeva,” he said in alarm, “no more initiations,\nplease! How can I assimilate any higher teachings? I have come today to ask your blessings, because the first\ndivine KRIYA has filled me with such intoxication that I cannot deliver my letters!”\n“Already Brinda swims in the sea of Spirit.” At these words from Lahiri Mahasaya, his other disciple hung his\nhead.\n“Master,” he said, “I see I have been a poor workman, finding fault with my tools.”\nThe postman, who was an uneducated man, later developed his insight through KRIYA to such an extent that\nscholars occasionally sought his interpretation on involved scriptural points. Innocent alike of sin and syntax,\nlittle Brinda won renown in the domain of learned pundits.\nBesides the numerous Benares disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya, hundreds came to him from distant parts of\nIndia. He himself traveled to Bengal on several occasions, visiting at the homes of the fathers−in−law of his\ntwo sons. Thus blessed by his presence, Bengal became honeycombed with small KRIYA groups.

For a\ntime Lahiri Mahasaya served as private tutor to the son of Maharaja Iswari Narayan Sinha Bahadur of\nBenares. Recognizing the master's spiritual attainment, the maharaja, as well as his son, sought KRIYA\ninitiation, as did the Maharaja Jotindra Mohan Thakur.\nA number of Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples with influential worldly position were desirous of expanding the\nKRIYA circle by publicity. The guru refused his permission. One chela, the royal physician to the Lord of\nBenares, started an organized effort to spread the master's name as “Kashi Baba” (Exalted One of Benares).\n{FN35−16} Again the guru forbade it.\n“Let the fragrance of the KRIYA flower be wafted naturally, without any display,” he said. “Its seeds will\ntake root in the soil of spiritually fertile hearts.”\nAlthough the great master did not adopt the system of preaching through the modern medium of an\norganization, or through the printing press, he knew that the power of his message would rise like a resistless\nflood, inundating by its own force the banks of human minds. The changed and purified lives of devotees\nwere the simple guarantees of the deathless vitality of KRIYA.\nIn 1886, twenty−five years after his Ranikhet initiation, Lahiri Mahasaya was retired on a pension.\n{FN35−17} With his availability in the daytime, disciples sought him out in ever−increasing numbers. The\ngreat guru now sat in silence most of the time, locked in the tranquil lotus posture. He seldom left his little\nparlor, even for a walk or to visit other parts of the house. A quiet stream of chelas arrived, almost ceaselessly,\nfor a DARSHAN (holy sight) of the guru.\nTo the awe of all beholders, Lahiri Mahasaya's habitual physiological state exhibited the superhuman features\nof breathlessness, sleeplessness, cessation of pulse and heartbeat, calm eyes unblinking for hours, and a\nprofound aura of peace. No visitors departed without upliftment of spirit; all knew they had received the silent\nblessing of a true man of God.\nThe master now permitted his disciple, Panchanon Bhattacharya, to open an “Arya Mission Institution” in\nCalcutta. Here the saintly disciple spread the message of KRIYA YOGA, and prepared for public benefit\ncertain yogic herbal {FN35−18} medicines.\nIn accordance with ancient custom, the master gave to people in general a NEEM {FN35−19} oil for the cure\nof various diseases. When the guru requested a disciple to distil the oil, he could easily accomplish the task. If\nanyone else tried, he would encounter strange difficulties, finding that the medicinal oil had almost evaporated\nafter going through the required distilling processes. Evidently the master's blessing was a necessary\ningredient.\n[Illustration:—lmwriting.jpg]\nLahiri Mahasaya's handwriting and signature, in Bengali script, are shown above.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 195, "text": "The Arya Mission Institution undertook the publication of many of the guru's scriptural commentaries. Like\nJesus and other great prophets, Lahiri Mahasaya himself wrote no books, but his penetrating interpretations\nwere recorded and arranged by various disciples. Some of these voluntary amanuenses were more discerning\nthan others in correctly conveying the profound insight of the guru; yet, on the whole, their efforts were\nsuccessful. Through their zeal, the world possesses unparalleled commentaries by Lahiri Mahasaya on\ntwenty−six ancient scriptures.\nSri Ananda Mohan Lahiri, a grandson of the master, has written an interesting booklet on KRIYA. “The text\nof the BHAGAVAD GITA is a part of the great epic, the MAHABHARATA, which possesses several\nknot−points (VYAS−KUTAS),” Sri Ananda wrote. “Keep those knot−points unquestioned, and we find\nnothing but mythical stories of a peculiar and easily−misunderstood type. Keep those knot−points\nunexplained, and we have lost a science which the East has preserved with superhuman patience after a quest\nof thousands of years of experiment. {FN35−20} It was the commentaries of Lahiri Mahasaya which brought\nto light, clear of allegories, the very science of religion that had been so cleverly put out of sight in the riddle\nof scriptural letters and imagery. No longer a mere unintelligible jugglery of words, the otherwise unmeaning\nformulas of Vedic worship have been proved by the master to be full of scientific significance. . . .\n“We know that man is usually helpless against the insurgent sway of evil passions, but these are rendered\npowerless and man finds no motive in their indulgence when there dawns on him a consciousness of superior\nand lasting bliss through KRIYA. Here the give−up, the negation of the lower passions, synchronizes with a\ntake−up, the assertion of a beatitude. Without such a course, hundreds of moral maxims which run in mere\nnegatives are useless to us.\n“Our eagerness for worldly activity kills in us the sense of spiritual awe. We cannot comprehend the Great\nLife behind all names and forms, just because science brings home to us how we can use the powers of nature;\nthis familiarity has bred a contempt for her ultimate secrets. Our relation with nature is one of practical\nbusiness. We tease her, so to speak, to know how she can be used to serve our purposes; we make use of her\nenergies, whose Source yet remains unknown. In science our relation with nature is one that exists between a\nman and his servant, or in a philosophical sense she is like a captive in the witness box. We cross−examine\nher, challenge her, and minutely weigh her evidence in human scales which cannot measure her hidden\nvalues. On the other hand, when the self is in communion with a higher power, nature automatically obeys,\nwithout stress or strain, the will of man. This effortless command over nature is called 'miraculous' by the\nuncomprehending materialist.\n“The life of Lahiri Mahasaya set an example which changed the erroneous notion that yoga is a mysterious\npractice. Every man may find a way through KRIYA to understand his proper relation with nature, and to feel\nspiritual reverence for all phenomena, whether mystical or of everyday occurrence, in spite of the\nmatter−of−factness of physical science. {FN35−21} We must bear in mind that what was mystical a thousand\nyears ago is no longer so, and what is mysterious now may become lawfully intelligible a hundred years\nhence. It is the Infinite, the Ocean of Power, that is at the back of all manifestations.\n“The law of KRIYA YOGA is eternal. It is true like mathematics; like the simple rules of addition and\nsubtraction, the law of KRIYA can never be destroyed. Burn to ashes all the books on mathematics, the\nlogically−minded will always rediscover such truths; destroy all the sacred books on yoga, its fundamental\nlaws will come out whenever there appears a true yogi who comprises within himself pure devotion and\nconsequently pure knowledge.”\nJust as Babaji is among the greatest of avatars, a MAHAVATAR, and Sri Yukteswar a JNANAVATAR or\nIncarnation of Wisdom, so Lahiri Mahasaya may justly be called YOGAVATAR, or Incarnation of Yoga. By\nthe standards of both qualitative and quantitative good, he elevated the spiritual level of society.

Apart from the miracles of his own life, surely the YOGAVATAR\nreached the zenith of all wonders in reducing the ancient complexities of yoga to an effective simplicity not\nbeyond the ordinary grasp.\nIn reference to miracles, Lahiri Mahasaya often said, “The operation of subtle laws which are unknown to\npeople in general should not be publicly discussed or published without due discrimination.” If in these pages\nI have appeared to flout his cautionary words, it is because he has given me an inward reassurance.

Our first meeting was in Allahabad at a KUMBHA MELA.”\nThe religious fairs held in India since time immemorial are known as KUMBHA MELAS; they have kept\nspiritual goals in constant sight of the multitude. Devout Hindus gather by the millions every six years to meet\nthousands of sadhus, yogis, swamis, and ascetics of all kinds. Many are hermits who never leave their\nsecluded haunts except to attend the MELAS and bestow their blessings on worldly men and women.\n“I was not a swami at the time I met Babaji,” Sri Yukteswar went on. “But I had already received KRIYA\ninitiation from Lahiri Mahasaya. He encouraged me to attend the MELA which was convening in January,\n1894 at Allahabad. It was my first experience of a KUMBHA; I felt slightly dazed by the clamor and surge of\nthe crowd. In my searching gazes around I saw no illumined face of a master. Passing a bridge on the bank of\nthe Ganges, I noticed an acquaintance standing near−by, his begging bowl extended.\n“'Oh, this fair is nothing but a chaos of noise and beggars,' I thought in disillusionment. 'I wonder if Western\nscientists, patiently enlarging the realms of knowledge for the practical good of mankind, are not more\npleasing to God than these idlers who profess religion but concentrate on alms.'\n“My smouldering reflections on social reform were interrupted by the voice of a tall sannyasi who halted\nbefore me.\n“'Sir,' he said, 'a saint is calling you.'\n“'Who is he?'\n“'Come and see for yourself.'\n“Hesitantly following this laconic advice, I soon found myself near a tree whose branches were sheltering a\nguru with an attractive group of disciples.

Everything on earth is of mixed character, like a mingling of sand and sugar. Be like the wise\nant which seizes only the sugar, and leaves the sand untouched. Though many sadhus here still wander in\ndelusion, yet the MELA is blessed by a few men of God−realization.'\n“In view of my own meeting with this exalted master, I quickly agreed with his observation.\n“'Sir,' I commented, 'I have been thinking of the scientific men of the West, greater by far in intelligence than\nmost people congregated here, living in distant Europe and America, professing different creeds, and ignorant\nof the real values of such MELAS as the present one. They are the men who could benefit greatly by meetings\nwith India's masters. But, although high in intellectual attainments, many Westerners are wedded to rank\nmaterialism. Others, famous in science and philosophy, do not recognize the essential unity in religion.

His awesome silence proved that my guru had\ninstantly controlled his being, cut his last cord of attachment to the material world, and fled to his ever−living\nidentity in Spirit. Babaji's remark had been his way of saying: 'I shall be ever with you.'\n“Though Babaji and Lahiri Mahasaya were omniscient, and had no need of communicating with each other\nthrough me or any other intermediary, the great ones often condescend to play a part in the human drama.\nOccasionally they transmit their prophecies through messengers in an ordinary way, that the final fulfillment\nof their words may infuse greater divine faith in a wide circle of men who later learn the story.\n“I soon left Benares, and set to work in Serampore on the scriptural writings requested by Babaji,” Sri\nYukteswar continued. “No sooner had I begun my task than I was able to compose a poem dedicated to the\ndeathless guru.

There, under the shade of the banyan, and surrounded by a few\ndisciples, sat the great Babaji!\n“'Greetings, Swamiji!' The beautiful voice of the master rang out to assure me I was not dreaming. 'I see you\nhave successfully completed your book. As I promised, I am here to thank you.'\n“With a fast−beating heart, I prostrated myself fully at his feet. 'Param−guruji,' I said imploringly, 'will you\nand your chelas not honor my near−by home with your presence?'\n“The supreme guru smilingly declined. 'No, child,' he said, 'we are people who like the shelter of trees; this\nspot is quite comfortable.'\n“'Please tarry awhile, Master.' I gazed entreatingly at him. 'I shall be back at once with some special\nsweetmeats.'\n“When I returned in a few minutes with a dish of delicacies, lo! the lordly banyan no longer sheltered the\ncelestial troupe. I searched all around the ghat, but in my heart I knew the little band had already fled on\netheric wings.\n“I was deeply hurt. 'Even if we meet again, I would not care to talk to him,' I assured myself. 'He was unkind\nto leave me so suddenly.' This was a wrath of love, of course, and nothing more.\n“A few months later I visited Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares. As I entered his little parlor, my guru smiled in\ngreeting.\n“'Welcome, Yukteswar,' he said. 'Did you just meet Babaji at the threshold of my room?'\n“'Why, no,' I answered in surprise.\n“'Come here.' Lahiri Mahasaya touched me gently on the forehead; at once I beheld, near the door, the form of\nBabaji, blooming like a perfect lotus.\n“I remembered my old hurt, and did not bow. Lahiri Mahasaya looked at me in astonishment.\n“The divine guru gazed at me with fathomless eyes. 'You are annoyed with me.'\n“'Sir, why shouldn't I be?' I answered. 'Out of the air you came with your magic group, and into the thin air\nyou vanished.'\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 36. BABAJI'S INTEREST IN THE WEST\n198\n"}

'You were full of\nexcitement. I assure you that I was fairly extinguished in the ether by the gust of your restlessness.'\n“I was instantly satisfied by this unflattering explanation. I knelt at his feet; the supreme guru patted me\nkindly on the shoulder.\n“'Child, you must meditate more,' he said. 'Your gaze is not yet faultless−you could not see me hiding behind\nthe sunlight.' With these words in the voice of a celestial flute, Babaji disappeared into the hidden radiance.\n“That was one of my last visits to Benares to see my guru,” Sri Yukteswar concluded. “Even as Babaji had\nforetold at the KUMBHA MELA, the householder−incarnation of Lahiri Mahasaya was drawing to a close.\nDuring the summer of 1895 his stalwart body developed a small boil on the back.

Finally a few chelas\nbecame very insistent; the master replied cryptically:\n“'The body has to find a cause to go; I will be agreeable to whatever you want to do.'\n“A short time later the incomparable guru gave up his body in Benares. No longer need I seek him out in his\nlittle parlor; I find every day of my life blessed by his omnipresent guidance.”\nYears later, from the lips of Swami Keshabananda, {FN36−6} an advanced disciple, I heard many wonderful\ndetails about the passing of Lahiri Mahasaya.\n“A few days before my guru relinquished his body,” Keshabananda told me, “he materialized himself before\nme as I sat in my hermitage at Hardwar.\n“'Come at once to Benares.' With these words Lahiri Mahasaya vanished.\n“I entrained immediately for Benares. At my guru's home I found many disciples assembled. For hours that\nday {FN36−7} the master expounded the GITA; then he addressed us simply.\n“'I am going home.'\n“Sobs of anguish broke out like an irresistible torrent.\n“'Be comforted; I shall rise again.' After this utterance Lahiri Mahasaya thrice turned his body around in a\ncircle, faced the north in his lotus posture, and gloriously entered the final MAHA−SAMADHI. {FN36−8}\n“Lahiri Mahasaya's beautiful body, so dear to the devotees, was cremated with solemn householder rites at\nManikarnika Ghat by the holy Ganges,” Keshabananda continued. “The following day, at ten o'clock in the\nmorning, while I was still in Benares, my room was suffused with a great light. Lo! before me stood the flesh\nand blood form of Lahiri Mahasaya! It looked exactly like his old body, except that it appeared younger and\nmore radiant. My divine guru spoke to me.\n“'Keshabananda,' he said, 'it is I. From the disintegrated atoms of my cremated body, I have resurrected a\nremodeled form. My householder work in the world is done; but I do not leave the earth entirely. Henceforth I\nshall spend some time with Babaji in the Himalayas, and with Babaji in the cosmos.'\n“With a few words of blessing to me, the transcendent master vanished. Wondrous inspiration filled my heart;\nI was uplifted in Spirit even as were the disciples of Christ and Kabir {FN36−9} when they had gazed on their\nliving gurus after physical death.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 36.

Yet it\ncomforted my heart to enshrine his sacred remains.”\nAnother disciple who was blessed by the sight of his resurrected guru was the saintly Panchanon\nBhattacharya, founder of the Calcutta Arya Mission Institution. {FN36−10}\nI visited Panchanon at his Calcutta home, and listened with delight to the story of his many years with the\nmaster. In conclusion, he told me of the most marvelous event in his life.\n“Here in Calcutta,” Panchanon said, “at ten o'clock of the morning which followed his cremation, Lahiri\nMahasaya appeared before me in living glory.”\nSwami Pranabananda, the “saint with two bodies,” also confided to me the details of his own supernal\nexperience.\n“A few days before Lahiri Mahasaya left his body,” Pranabananda told me at the time he visited my Ranchi\nschool, “I received a letter from him, requesting me to come at once to Benares. I was delayed, however, and\ncould not leave immediately. As I was in the midst of my travel preparations, about ten o'clock in the\nmorning, I was suddenly overwhelmed with joy to see the shining figure of my guru.\n“'Why hurry to Benares?'

'Here, touch my flesh,' he said. 'I am living, as always. Do not\nlament; am I not with you forever?'“\nFrom the lips of these three great disciples, a story of wondrous truth has emerged: At the morning hour of\nten, on the day after the body of Lahiri Mahasaya had been consigned to the flames, the resurrected master, in\na real but transfigured body, appeared before three disciples, each one in a different city.\n“So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then\nshall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

I had heard many stories about the materialistic Western atmosphere, one\nvery different from the spiritual background of India, pervaded with the centuried aura of saints. “An Oriental\nteacher who will dare the Western airs,” I thought, “must be hardy beyond the trials of any Himalayan cold!”\nOne early morning I began to pray, with an adamant determination to continue, to even die praying, until I\nheard the voice of God. I wanted His blessing and assurance that I would not lose myself in the fogs of\nmodern utilitarianism. My heart was set to go to America, but even more strongly was it resolved to hear the\nsolace of divine permission.\nI prayed and prayed, muffling my sobs. No answer came. My silent petition increased in excruciating\ncrescendo until, at noon, I had reached a zenith; my brain could no longer withstand the pressure of my\nagonies. If I cried once more with an increased depth of my inner passion, I felt as though my brain would\nsplit. At that moment there came a knock outside the vestibule adjoining the Gurpar Road room in which I\nwas sitting. Opening the door, I saw a young man in the scanty garb of a renunciate. He came in, closed the\ndoor behind him and, refusing my request to sit down, indicated with a gesture that he wished to talk to me\nwhile standing.\n“He must be Babaji!” I thought, dazed, because the man before me had the features of a younger Lahiri\nMahasaya.\nHe answered my thought. “Yes, I am Babaji.” He spoke melodiously in Hindi. “Our Heavenly Father has\nheard your prayer. He commands me to tell you: Follow the behests of your guru and go to America. Fear not;\nyou will be protected.”\nAfter a vibrant pause, Babaji addressed me again. “You are the one I have chosen to spread the message of\nKRIYA YOGA in the West. Long ago I met your guru Yukteswar at a KUMBHA MELA; I told him then I\nwould send you to him for training.”\nI was speechless, choked with devotional awe at his presence, and deeply touched to hear from his own lips\nthat he had guided me to Sri Yukteswar. I lay prostrate before the deathless guru. He graciously lifted me\nfrom the floor. Telling me many things about my life, he then gave me some personal instruction, and uttered\na few secret prophecies.\n“KRIYA YOGA, the scientific technique of God−realization,” he finally said with solemnity, “will ultimately\nspread in all lands, and aid in harmonizing the nations through man's personal, transcendental perception of\nthe Infinite Father.”\nWith a gaze of majestic power, the master electrified me by a glimpse of his cosmic consciousness. In a short\nwhile he started toward the door.\n“Do not try to follow me,” he said. “You will not be able to do so.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 37. I GO TO AMERICA\n203\n"}

From the door, Babaji gave me a last affectionate glance. He raised his hand by way\nof benediction and walked away, my eyes fixed on him longingly.\nAfter a few minutes my feet were free. I sat down and went into a deep meditation, unceasingly thanking God\nnot only for answering my prayer but for blessing me by a meeting with Babaji.

Long had it been my burning desire to\nbehold him.\nUntil now, I have never recounted to anyone this story of my meeting with Babaji.

Seek and incorporate into your being the best\nqualities of all your brothers, scattered over the earth in various races.”\nThen he blessed me: “All those who come to you with faith, seeking God, will be helped. As you look at\nthem, the spiritual current emanating from your eyes will enter into their brains and change their material\nhabits, making them more God−conscious.”\nHe went on, “Your lot to attract sincere souls is very good. Everywhere you go, even in a wilderness, you will\nfind friends.”\nBoth of his blessings have been amply demonstrated. I came alone to America, into a wilderness without a\nsingle friend, but there I found thousands ready to receive the time−tested soul−teachings.\nI left India in August, 1920, on THE CITY OF SPARTA, the first passenger boat sailing for America after the\nclose of World War I. I had been able to book passage only after the removal, in ways fairly miraculous, of\nmany “red−tape” difficulties concerned with the granting of my passport.\nDuring the two−months' voyage a fellow passenger found out that I was the Indian delegate to the Boston\ncongress.\n“Swami Yogananda,” he said, with the first of many quaint pronunciations by which I was later to hear my\nname spoken by the Americans, “please favor the passengers with a lecture next Thursday night. I think we\nwould all benefit by a talk on 'The Battle of Life and How to Fight It.'“\nAlas! I had to fight the battle of my own life, I discovered on Wednesday. Desperately trying to organize my\nideas into a lecture in English, I finally abandoned all preparations; my thoughts, like a wild colt eyeing a\nsaddle, refused any cooperation with the laws of English grammar.

In the span of my own lifetime I have observed such wondrous progress in plant evolution that I\nlook forward optimistically to a healthy, happy world as soon as its children are taught the principles of\nsimple and rational living. We must return to nature and nature's God.”\n“Luther, you would delight in my Ranchi school, with its outdoor classes, and atmosphere of joy and\nsimplicity.”\nMy words touched the chord closest to Burbank's heart−child education. He plied me with questions, interest\ngleaming from his deep, serene eyes.\n“Swamiji,” he said finally, “schools like yours are the only hope of a future millennium. I am in revolt against\nthe educational systems of our time, severed from nature and stifling of all individuality. I am with you heart\nand soul in your practical ideals of education.”\nAs I was taking leave of the gentle sage, he autographed a small volume and presented it to me. {FN38−1}\n“Here is my book on THE TRAINING OF THE HUMAN PLANT,” {FN38−2} he said. “New types of\ntraining are needed−fearless experiments. At times the most daring trials have succeeded in bringing out the\nbest in fruits and flowers. Educational innovations for children should likewise become more numerous, more\ncourageous.”\nI read his little book that night with intense interest. His eye envisioning a glorious future for the race, he\nwrote: “The most stubborn living thing in this world, the most difficult to swerve, is a plant once fixed in\ncertain habits. . . . Remember that this plant has preserved its individuality all through the ages; perhaps it is\none which can be traced backward through eons of time in the very rocks themselves, never having varied to\nany great extent in all these vast periods. Do you suppose, after all these ages of repetition, the plant does not\nbecome possessed of a will, if you so choose to call it, of unparalleled tenacity? Indeed, there are plants, like\ncertain of the palms, so persistent that no human power has yet been able to change them. The human will is a\nweak thing beside the will of a plant. But see how this whole plant's lifelong stubbornness is broken simply by\nblending a new life with it, making, by crossing, a complete and powerful change in its life. Then when the\nbreak comes, fix it by these generations of patient supervision and selection, and the new plant sets out upon\nits new way never again to return to the old, its tenacious will broken and changed at last.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 38.

One morning I arrived at the same\ntime as the postman, who deposited in Burbank's study about a thousand letters. Horticulturists wrote him\nfrom all parts of the world.\n“Swamiji, your presence is just the excuse I need to get out into the garden,” Luther said gaily. He opened a\nlarge desk−drawer containing hundreds of travel folders.\n“See,” he said, “this is how I do my traveling. Tied down by my plants and correspondence, I satisfy my\ndesire for foreign lands by a glance now and then at these pictures.”\nMy car was standing before his gate; Luther and I drove along the streets of the little town, its gardens bright\nwith his own varieties of Santa Rosa, Peachblow, and Burbank roses.\n“My friend Henry Ford and I both believe in the ancient theory of reincarnation,” Luther told me. “It sheds\nlight on aspects of life otherwise inexplicable. Memory is not a test of truth; just because man fails to\nremember his past lives does not prove he never had them. Memory is blank concerning his womb−life and\ninfancy, too; but he probably passed through them!” He chuckled.\nThe great scientist had received KRIYA initiation during one of my earlier visits. “I practice the technique\ndevoutly, Swamiji,” he said. After many thoughtful questions to me about various aspects of yoga, Luther\nremarked slowly:\n“The East indeed possesses immense hoards of knowledge which the West has scarcely begun to explore.”\nIntimate communion with nature, who unlocked to him many of her jealously guarded secrets, had given\nBurbank a boundless spiritual reverence.\n“Sometimes I feel very close to the Infinite Power,” he confided shyly. His sensitive, beautifully modeled face\nlit with his memories. “Then I have been able to heal sick persons around me, as well as many ailing plants.”\nHe told me of his mother, a sincere Christian. “Many times after her death,” Luther said, “I have been blessed\nby her appearance in visions; she has spoken to me.”\nWe drove back reluctantly toward his home and those waiting thousand letters.\n“Luther,” I remarked, “next month I am starting a magazine to present the truth−offerings of East and West.\nPlease help me decide on a good name for the journal.”\nWe discussed titles for awhile, and finally agreed on EAST−WEST. After we had reentered his study,\nBurbank gave me an article he had written on “Science and Civilization.”\n“This will go in the first issue of EAST−WEST,” I said gratefully.\nAs our friendship grew deeper, I called Burbank my “American saint.” “Behold a man,” I quoted, “in whom\nthere is no guile!” His heart was fathomlessly deep, long acquainted with humility, patience, sacrifice. His\nlittle home amidst the roses was austerely simple; he knew the worthlessness of luxury, the joy of few\npossessions. The modesty with which he wore his scientific fame repeatedly reminded me of the trees that\nbend low with the burden of ripening fruits; it is the barren tree that lifts its head high in an empty boast.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 38.

A group of my\nAmerican students, garbed in Hindu ceremonial clothes, chanted the ancient hymns as an offering was made\nof flowers, water, and fire−symbols of the bodily elements and their release in the Infinite Source.\nThough the form of Burbank lies in Santa Rosa under a Lebanon cedar that he planted years ago in his garden,\nhis soul is enshrined for me in every wide−eyed flower that blooms by the wayside.

Traversing ten thousand miles in the twinkling of an eye, his message penetrated my being like\na flash of lightning.\nFifteen years! Yes, I realized, now it is 1935; I have spent fifteen years in spreading my guru's teachings in\nAmerica. Now he recalls me.\nThat afternoon I recounted my experience to a visiting disciple. His spiritual development under KRIYA\nYOGA was so remarkable that I often called him “saint,” remembering Babaji's prophecy that America too\nwould produce men and women of divine realization through the ancient yogic path.\nThis disciple and a number of others generously insisted on making a donation for my travels. The financial\nproblem thus solved, I made arrangements to sail, via Europe, for India. Busy weeks of preparations at Mount\nWashington! In March, 1935 I had the Self−Realization Fellowship chartered under the laws of the State of\nCalifornia as a non−profit corporation. To this educational institution go all public donations as well as the\nrevenue from the sale of my books, magazine, written courses, class tuition, and every other source of income.\n“I shall be back,” I told my students. “Never shall I forget America.”\nAt a farewell banquet given to me in Los Angeles by loving friends, I looked long at their faces and thought\ngratefully, “Lord, he who remembers Thee as the Sole Giver will never lack the sweetness of friendship\namong mortals.”\nI sailed from New York on June 9, 1935 {FN39−1} in the EUROPA.

Our period of leisure was short−lived; the\nspeed of modern boats has some regrettable features!\nLike any other group of inquisitive tourists, we walked around the huge and ancient city of London. The\nfollowing day I was invited to address a large meeting in Caxton Hall, at which I was introduced to the\nLondon audience by Sir Francis Younghusband. Our party spent a pleasant day as guests of Sir Harry Lauder\nat his estate in Scotland. We soon crossed the English Channel to the continent, for I wanted to make a special\npilgrimage to Bavaria. This would be my only chance, I felt, to visit the great Catholic mystic, Therese\nNeumann of Konnersreuth.\nYears earlier I had read an amazing account of Therese. Information given in the article was as follows:\n(1) Therese, born in 1898, had been injured in an accident at the age of twenty; she became blind and\nparalyzed.\n(2) She miraculously regained her sight in 1923 through prayers to St. Teresa, “The Little Flower.” Later\nTherese Neumann's limbs were instantaneously healed.\n(3) From 1923 onward, Therese has abstained completely from food and drink, except for the daily\nswallowing of one small consecrated wafer.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 39.

At appropriate times in her vision, she speaks\nHebrew or Greek.\n(6) By ecclesiastical permission, Therese has several times been under close scientific observation. Dr. Fritz\nGerlick, editor of a Protestant German newspaper, went to Konnersreuth to “expose the Catholic fraud,” but\nended up by reverently writing her biography. {FN39−2}\nAs always, whether in East or West, I was eager to meet a saint. I rejoiced as our little party entered, on July\n16th, the quaint village of Konnersreuth. The Bavarian peasants exhibited lively interest in our Ford\nautomobile (brought with us from America) and its assorted group−an American young man, an elderly lady,\nand an olive−hued Oriental with long hair tucked under his coat collar.\nTherese's little cottage, clean and neat, with geraniums blooming by a primitive well, was alas! silently closed.\nThe neighbors, and even the village postman who passed by, could give us no information. Rain began to fall;\nmy companions suggested that we leave.\n“No,” I said stubbornly, “I will stay here until I find some clue leading to Therese.”\nTwo hours later we were still sitting in our car amidst the dismal rain. “Lord,” I sighed complainingly, “why\ndidst Thou lead me here if she has disappeared?”\nAn English−speaking man halted beside us, politely offering his aid.\n“I don't know for certain where Therese is,” he said, “but she often visits at the home of Professor Wurz, a\nseminary master of Eichstatt, eighty miles from here.”\nThe following morning our party motored to the quiet village of Eichstatt, narrowly lined with cobblestoned\nstreets. Dr. Wurz greeted us cordially at his home; “Yes, Therese is here.” He sent her word of the visitors. A\nmessenger soon appeared with her reply.\n“Though the bishop has asked me to see no one without his permission, I will receive the man of God from\nIndia.”\nDeeply touched at these words, I followed Dr. Wurz upstairs to the sitting room. Therese entered immediately,\nradiating an aura of peace and joy. She wore a black gown and spotless white head dress. Although her age\nwas thirty−seven at this time, she seemed much younger, possessing indeed a childlike freshness and charm.\nHealthy, well−formed, rosy−cheeked, and cheerful, this is the saint that does not eat!\nTherese greeted me with a very gentle handshaking. We both beamed in silent communion, each knowing the\nother to be a lover of God.\nDr. Wurz kindly offered to serve as interpreter. As we seated ourselves, I noticed that Therese was glancing at\nme with naive curiosity; evidently Hindus had been rare in Bavaria.\n“Don't you eat anything?” I wanted to hear the answer from her own lips.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 39.

One of the reasons I am here on earth today is to\nprove that man can live by God's invisible light, and not by food only.”\n“Can you teach others how to live without food?”\nShe appeared a trifle shocked. “I cannot do that; God does not wish it.”\nAs my gaze fell on her strong, graceful hands, Therese showed me a little, square, freshly healed wound on\neach of her palms. On the back of each hand, she pointed out a smaller, crescent−shaped wound, freshly\nhealed. Each wound went straight through the hand. The sight brought to my mind distinct recollection of the\nlarge square iron nails with crescent−tipped ends, still used in the Orient, but which I do not recall having seen\nin the West.\nThe saint told me something of her weekly trances. “As a helpless onlooker, I observe the whole Passion of\nChrist.” Each week, from Thursday midnight until Friday afternoon at one o'clock, her wounds open and\nbleed; she loses ten pounds of her ordinary 121−pound weight. Suffering intensely in her sympathetic love,\nTherese yet looks forward joyously to these weekly visions of her Lord.\nI realized at once that her strange life is intended by God to reassure all Christians of the historical\nauthenticity of Jesus' life and crucifixion as recorded in the New Testament, and to dramatically display the\never−living bond between the Galilean Master and his devotees.\nProfessor Wurz related some of his experiences with the saint.\n“Several of us, including Therese, often travel for days on sight−seeing trips throughout Germany,” he told\nme. “It is a striking contrast−while we have three meals a day, Therese eats nothing. She remains as fresh as a\nrose, untouched by the fatigue which the trips cause us. As we grow hungry and hunt for wayside inns, she\nlaughs merrily.”\nThe professor added some interesting physiological details: “Because Therese takes no food, her stomach has\nshrunk. She has no excretions, but her perspiration glands function; her skin is always soft and firm.”\nAt the time of parting, I expressed to Therese my desire to be present at her trance.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 39.

Mr. Wright turned on the\nautomobile radio; the saint examined it with little enthusiastic chuckles. Such a large crowd of youngsters\ngathered that Therese retreated into the house. We saw her at a window, where she peered at us, childlike,\nwaving her hand.\nFrom a conversation the next day with two of Therese's brothers, very kind and amiable, we learned that the\nsaint sleeps only one or two hours at night. In spite of the many wounds in her body, she is active and full of\nenergy. She loves birds, looks after an aquarium of fish, and works often in her garden. Her correspondence is\nlarge; Catholic devotees write her for prayers and healing blessings. Many seekers have been cured through\nher of serious diseases.\nHer brother Ferdinand, about twenty−three, explained that Therese has the power, through prayer, of working\nout on her own body the ailments of others. The saint's abstinence from food dates from a time when she\nprayed that the throat disease of a young man of her parish, then preparing to enter holy orders, be transferred\nto her own throat.\nOn Thursday afternoon our party drove to the home of the bishop, who looked at my flowing locks with some\nsurprise. He readily wrote out the necessary permit. There was no fee; the rule made by the Church is simply\nto protect Therese from the onrush of casual tourists, who in previous years had flocked on Fridays by the\nthousands.\nWe arrived Friday morning about nine−thirty in Konnersreuth. I noticed that Therese's little cottage possesses\na special glass−roofed section to afford her plenty of light. We were glad to see the doors no longer closed,\nbut wide−open in hospitable cheer. There was a line of about twenty visitors, armed with their permits. Many\nhad come from great distances to view the mystic trance.\nTherese had passed my first test at the professor's house by her intuitive knowledge that I wanted to see her\nfor spiritual reasons, and not just to satisfy a passing curiosity.\nMy second test was connected with the fact that, just before I went upstairs to her room, I put myself into a\nyogic trance state in order to be one with her in telepathic and televisic rapport. I entered her chamber, filled\nwith visitors; she was lying in a white robe on the bed. With Mr. Wright following closely behind me, I halted\njust inside the threshold, awestruck at a strange and most frightful spectacle.\n[Illustration: THERESE NEUMANN, Famous Catholic Stigmatist who inspired my 1935 pilgrimage to\nKonnersreuth, Bavaria—see neumann.jpg]\nBlood flowed thinly and continuously in an inch−wide stream from Therese's lower eyelids. Her gaze was\nfocused upward on the spiritual eye within the central forehead. The cloth wrapped around her head was\ndrenched in blood from the stigmata wounds of the crown of thorns. The white garment was redly splotched\nover her heart from the wound in her side at the spot where Christ's body, long ages ago, had suffered the final\nindignity of the soldier's spear−thrust.\nTherese's hands were extended in a gesture maternal, pleading; her face wore an expression both tortured and\ndivine. She appeared thinner, changed in many subtle as well as outward ways.

Before us, near the head of the stairs, quietly appeared the Great One,\nSwami Sri Yukteswarji, standing in the noble pose of a sage.\n“My heart heaved and swelled as I felt myself blessed by the privilege of being in his sublime presence. Tears\nblurred my eager sight when Yoganandaji dropped to his knees, and with bowed head offered his soul's\ngratitude and greeting, touching with his hand his guru's feet and then, in humble obeisance, his own head. He\nrose then and was embraced on both sides of the bosom by Sri Yukteswarji.\n“No words passed at the beginning, but the most intense feeling was expressed in the mute phrases of the soul.\nHow their eyes sparkled and were fired with the warmth of renewed soul−union! A tender vibration surged\nthrough the quiet patio, and even the sun eluded the clouds to add a sudden blaze of glory.\n“On bended knee before the master I gave my own unexpressed love and thanks, touching his feet, calloused\nby time and service, and receiving his blessing. I stood then and faced two beautiful deep eyes smouldering\nwith introspection, yet radiant with joy. We entered his sitting room, whose whole side opened to the outer\nbalcony first seen from the street. The master braced himself against a worn davenport, sitting on a covered\nmattress on the cement floor. Yoganandaji and I sat near the guru's feet, with orange−colored pillows to lean\nagainst and ease our positions on the straw mat.\n“I tried and tried to penetrate the Bengali conversation between the two Swamijis−for English, I discovered, is\nnull and void when they are together, although Swamiji Maharaj, as the great guru is called by others, can and\noften does speak it. But I perceived the saintliness of the Great One through his heart−warming smile and\ntwinkling eyes. One quality easily discernible in his merry, serious conversation is a decided positiveness in\nstatement−the mark of a wise man, who knows he knows, because he knows God. His great wisdom, strength\nof purpose, and determination are apparent in every way.\n“Studying him reverently from time to time, I noted that he is of large, athletic stature, hardened by the trials\nand sacrifices of renunciation. His poise is majestic. A decidedly sloping forehead, as if seeking the heavens,\ndominates his divine countenance. He has a rather large and homely nose, with which he amuses himself in\nidle moments, flipping and wiggling it with his fingers, like a child. His powerful dark eyes are haloed by an\nethereal blue ring. His hair, parted in the middle, begins as silver and changes to streaks of silvery−gold and\nsilvery−black, ending in ringlets at his shoulders. His beard and moustache are scant or thinned out, yet seem\nto enhance his features and, like his character, are deep and light at the same time.\n“He has a jovial and rollicking laugh which comes from deep in his chest, causing him to shake and quiver\nthroughout his body−very cheerful and sincere. His face and stature are striking in their power, as are his\nmuscular fingers. He moves with a dignified tread and erect posture.\n“He was clad simply in the common DHOTI and shirt, both once dyed a strong ocher color, but now a faded\norange.\n“Glancing about, I observed that this rather dilapidated room suggested the owner's non−attachment to\nmaterial comforts. The weather−stained white walls of the long chamber were streaked with fading blue\nplaster. At one end of the room hung a picture of Lahiri Mahasaya, garlanded in simple devotion. There was\nalso an old picture showing Yoganandaji as he had first arrived in Boston, standing with the other delegates to\nthe Congress of Religions.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 40.

A huge, cut−glass, candle−light chandelier was\ncovered with cobwebs through disuse, and on the wall was a bright, up−to−date calendar. The whole room\nemanated a fragrance of peace and calmness. Beyond the balcony I could see coconut trees towering over the\nhermitage in silent protection.\n“It is interesting to observe that the master has merely to clap his hands together and, before finishing, he is\nserved or attended by some small disciple. Incidentally, I am much attracted to one of them−a thin lad, named\nPrafulla, {FN40−2} with long black hair to his shoulders, a most penetrating pair of sparkling black eyes, and\na heavenly smile; his eyes twinkle, as the corners of his mouth rise, like the stars and the crescent moon\nappearing at twilight.\n“Swami Sri Yukteswarji's joy is obviously intense at the return of his 'product' (and he seems to be somewhat\ninquisitive about the 'product's product'). However, predominance of the wisdom−aspect in the Great One's\nnature hinders his outward expression of feeling.\n“Yoganandaji presented him with some gifts, as is the custom when the disciple returns to his guru. We sat\ndown later to a simple but well−cooked meal. All the dishes were vegetable and rice combinations. Sri\nYukteswarji was pleased at my use of a number of Indian customs, 'finger−eating' for example.\n“After several hours of flying Bengali phrases and the exchange of warm smiles and joyful glances, we paid\nobeisance at his feet, bade adieu with a PRONAM, {FN40−3} and departed for Calcutta with an everlasting\nmemory of a sacred meeting and greeting. Although I write chiefly of my external impressions of him, yet I\nwas always conscious of the true basis of the saint−his spiritual glory. I felt his power, and shall carry that\nfeeling as my divine blessing.”\nFrom America, Europe, and Palestine I had brought many presents for Sri Yukteswar. He received them\nsmilingly, but without remark. For my own use, I had bought in Germany a combination umbrella−cane. In\nIndia I decided to give the cane to Master.\n“This gift I appreciate indeed!” My guru's eyes were turned on me with affectionate understanding as he made\nthe unwonted comment. From all the presents, it was the cane that he singled out to display to visitors.\n“Master, please permit me to get a new carpet for the sitting room.” I had noticed that Sri Yukteswar's tiger\nskin was placed over a torn rug.\n“Do so if it pleases you.” My guru's voice was not enthusiastic. “Behold, my tiger mat is nice and clean; I am\nmonarch in my own little kingdom. Beyond it is the vast world, interested only in externals.”\nAs he uttered these words I felt the years roll back; once again I am a young disciple, purified in the daily fires\nof chastisement!\nAs soon as I could tear myself away from Serampore and Calcutta, I set out, with Mr. Wright, for Ranchi.\nWhat a welcome there, a veritable ovation! Tears stood in my eyes as I embraced the selfless teachers who\nhad kept the banner of the school flying during my fifteen years' absence. The bright faces and happy smiles\nof the residential and day students were ample testimony to the worth of their many−sided school and yoga\ntraining.\nYet, alas! the Ranchi institution was in dire financial difficulties. Sir Manindra Chandra Nundy, the old\nMaharaja whose Kasimbazar Palace had been converted into the central school building, and who had made\nmany princely donations was now dead. Many free, benevolent features of the school were now seriously\nendangered for lack of sufficient public support.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 40. I RETURN TO INDIA\n218\n"}

For one week I remained in Ranchi, wrestling with critical problems. Then came interviews in\nCalcutta with prominent leaders and educators, a long talk with the young Maharaja of Kasimbazar, a\nfinancial appeal to my father, and lo! the shaky foundations of Ranchi began to be righted. Many donations\nincluding one huge check arrived in the nick of time from my American students.\nWithin a few months after my arrival in India, I had the joy of seeing the Ranchi school legally incorporated.\nMy lifelong dream of a permanently endowed yoga educational center stood fulfilled. That vision had guided\nme in the humble beginnings in 1917 with a group of seven boys.\nIn the decade since 1935, Ranchi has enlarged its scope far beyond the boys' school. Widespread humanitarian\nactivities are now carried on there in the Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya Mission.\nThe school, or Yogoda Sat−Sanga Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, conducts outdoor classes in grammar and high\nschool subjects. The residential students and day scholars also receive vocational training of some kind. The\nboys themselves regulate most of their activities through autonomous committees. Very early in my career as\nan educator I discovered that boys who impishly delight in outwitting a teacher will cheerfully accept\ndisciplinary rules that are set by their fellow students. Never a model pupil myself, I had a ready sympathy for\nall boyish pranks and problems.\nSports and games are encouraged; the fields resound with hockey and football practice. Ranchi students often\nwin the cup at competitive events. The outdoor gymnasium is known far and wide. Muscle recharging through\nwill power is the YOGODA feature: mental direction of life energy to any part of the body. The boys are also\ntaught ASANAS (postures), sword and LATHI (stick) play, and jujitsu. The Yogoda Health Exhibitions at the\nRanchi VIDYALAYA have been attended by thousands.\nInstruction in primary subjects is given in Hindi to the KOLS, SANTALS, and MUNDAS, aboriginal tribes of\nthe province. Classes for girls only have been organized in near−by villages.\nThe unique feature at Ranchi is the initiation into KRIYA YOGA. The boys daily practice their spiritual\nexercises, engage in GITA chanting, and are taught by precept and example the virtues of simplicity,\nself−sacrifice, honor, and truth. Evil is pointed out to them as being that which produces misery; good as those\nactions which result in true happiness. Evil may be compared to poisoned honey, tempting but laden with\ndeath.\nOvercoming restlessness of body and mind by concentration techniques has achieved astonishing results: it is\nno novelty at Ranchi to see an appealing little figure, aged nine or ten years, sitting for an hour or more in\nunbroken poise, the unwinking gaze directed to the spiritual eye. Often the picture of these Ranchi students\nhas returned to my mind, as I observed collegians over the world who are hardly able to sit still through one\nclass period. {FN40−4}\nRanchi lies 2000 feet above sea level; the climate is mild and equable. The twenty−five acre site, by a large\nbathing pond, includes one of the finest orchards in India−five hundred fruit trees−mango, guava, litchi,\njackfruit, date. The boys grow their own vegetables, and spin at their CHARKAS.\nA guest house is hospitably open for Western visitors. The Ranchi library contains numerous magazines, and\nabout a thousand volumes in English and Bengali, donations from the West and the East. There is a collection\nof the scriptures of the world. A well−classified museum displays archeological, geological, and\nanthropological exhibits; trophies, to a great extent, of my wanderings over the Lord's varied earth.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 40.

Daily prayers and\nscripture classes are held in the garden under the mango bowers.\nBranch high schools, with the residential and yoga features of Ranchi, have been opened and are now\nflourishing. These are the Yogoda Sat−Sanga Vidyapith (School) for Boys, at Lakshmanpur in Bihar; and the\nYogoda Sat−Sanga High School and hermitage at Ejmalichak in Midnapore.\nA stately Yogoda Math was dedicated in 1939 at Dakshineswar, directly on the Ganges. Only a few miles\nnorth of Calcutta, the new hermitage affords a haven of peace for city dwellers. Suitable accommodations are\navailable for Western guests, and particularly for those seekers who are intensely dedicating their lives to\nspiritual realization. The activities of the Yogoda Math include a fortnightly mailing of Self−Realization\nFellowship teachings to students in various parts of India.\nIt is needless to say that all these educational and humanitarian activities have required the self−sacrificing\nservice and devotion of many teachers and workers. I do not list their names here, because they are so\nnumerous; but in my heart each one has a lustrous niche. Inspired by the ideals of Lahiri Mahasaya, these\nteachers have abandoned promising worldly goals to serve humbly, to give greatly.\nMr. Wright formed many fast friendships with Ranchi boys; clad in a simple DHOTI, he lived for awhile\namong them. At Ranchi, Calcutta, Serampore, everywhere he went, my secretary, who has a vivid gift of\ndescription, hauled out his travel diary to record his adventures. One evening I asked him a question.\n“Dick, what is your impression of India?”\n“Peace,” he said thoughtfully. “The racial aura is peace.”\n{FN40−1} We broke our journey in Central Provinces, halfway across the continent, to see Mahatma Gandhi\nat Wardha.

The test would be like this: one person would start ringing a bell,\nthe number of rings having to be counted by the 'memory man.' A second person would dictate from a paper a\nlong exercise in arithmetic, involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A third would go on\nreciting from the RAMAYANA or the MAHABHARATA a long series of poems, which had to be\nreproduced; a fourth would set problems in versification which required the composition of verses in proper\nmeter on a given subject, each line to end in a specified word, a fifth man would carry on with a sixth a\ntheological disputation, the exact language of which had to be quoted in the precise order in which the\ndisputants conducted it, and a seventh man was all the while turning a wheel, the number of revolutions of\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 40.

AN IDYL IN SOUTH INDIA\n“You are the first Westerner, Dick, ever to enter that shrine. Many others have tried in vain.”\nAt my words Mr. Wright looked startled, then pleased. We had just left the beautiful Chamundi Temple in the\nhills overlooking Mysore in southern India. There we had bowed before the gold and silver altars of the\nGoddess Chamundi, patron deity of the family of the reigning maharaja.\n“As a souvenir of the unique honor,” Mr. Wright said, carefully stowing away a few blessed rose petals, “I\nwill always preserve this flower, sprinkled by the priest with rose water.”\nMy companion and I {FN41−1} were spending the month of November, 1935, as guests of the State of\nMysore. The Maharaja, H.H. Sri Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, is a model prince with intelligent devotion to his\npeople. A pious Hindu, the Maharaja has empowered a Mohammedan, the able Mirza Ismail, as his Dewan or\nPremier. Popular representation is given to the seven million inhabitants of Mysore in both an Assembly and a\nLegislative Council.\nThe heir to the Maharaja, H.H. the Yuvaraja, Sir Sri Krishna Narasingharaj Wadiyar, had invited my secretary\nand me to visit his enlightened and progressive realm. During the past fortnight I had addressed thousands of\nMysore citizens and students, at the Town Hall, the Maharajah's College, the University Medical School; and\nthree mass meetings in Bangalore, at the National High School, the Intermediate College, and the Chetty\nTown Hall where over three thousand persons had assembled. Whether the eager listeners had been able to\ncredit the glowing picture I drew of America, I know not; but the applause had always been loudest when I\nspoke of the mutual benefits that could flow from exchange of the best features in East and West.\nMr. Wright and I were now relaxing in the tropical peace. His travel diary gives the following account of his\nimpressions of Mysore:\n“Brilliantly green rice fields, varied by tasseled sugar cane patches, nestle at the protective foot of rocky\nhills−hills dotting the emerald panorama like excrescences of black stone−and the play of colors is enhanced\nby the sudden and dramatic disappearance of the sun as it seeks rest behind the solemn hills.\n“Many rapturous moments have been spent in gazing, almost absent−mindedly, at the ever−changing canvas\nof God stretched across the firmament, for His touch alone is able to produce colors that vibrate with the\nfreshness of life. That youth of colors is lost when man tries to imitate with mere pigments, for the Lord\nresorts to a more simple and effective medium−oils that are neither oils nor pigments, but mere rays of light.\nHe tosses a splash of light here, and it reflects red; He waves the brush again and it blends gradually into\norange and gold; then with a piercing thrust He stabs the clouds with a streak of purple that leaves a ringlet or\nfringe of red oozing out of the wound in the clouds; and so, on and on, He plays, night and morning alike,\never−changing, ever−new, ever−fresh; no patterns, no duplicates, no colors just the same. The beauty of the\nIndian change in day to night is beyond compare elsewhere; often the sky looks as if God had taken all the\ncolors in His kit and given them one mighty kaleidoscopic toss into the heavens.\n“I must relate the splendor of a twilight visit to the huge Krishnaraja Sagar Dam, {FN41−2} constructed\ntwelve miles outside of Mysore.

Broad fertile plains, the lovely Nilgiris or “Blue Mountains,” other regions with\nbarren hills of limestone or granite. Hyderabad history is a long, colorful story, starting three thousand years\nago under the Andhra kings, and continuing under Hindu dynasties until A.D. 1294, when it passed to a line\nof Moslem rulers who reign to this day.\nThe most breath−taking display of architecture, sculpture, and painting in all India is found at Hyderabad in\nthe ancient rock−sculptured caves of Ellora and Ajanta. The Kailasa at Ellora, a huge monolithic temple,\npossesses carved figures of gods, men, and beasts in the stupendous proportions of a Michelangelo. Ajanta is\nthe site of five cathedrals and twenty−five monasteries, all rock excavations maintained by tremendous\nfrescoed pillars on which artists and sculptors have immortalized their genius.\nHyderabad City is graced by the Osmania University and by the imposing Mecca Masjid Mosque, where ten\nthousand Mohammedans may assemble for prayer.\nMysore State too is a scenic wonderland, three thousand feet above sea level, abounding in dense tropical\nforests, the home of wild elephants, bison, bears, panthers, and tigers. Its two chief cities, Bangalore and\nMysore, are clean, attractive, with many parks and public gardens.\nHindu architecture and sculpture achieved their highest perfection in Mysore under the patronage of Hindu\nkings from the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries. The temple at Belur, an eleventh−century masterpiece\ncompleted during the reign of King Vishnuvardhana, is unsurpassed in the world for its delicacy of detail and\nexuberant imagery.\nThe rock pillars found in northern Mysore date from the third century B.C., illuminating the memory of King\nAsoka. He succeeded to the throne of the Maurya dynasty then prevailing; his empire included nearly all of\nmodern India, Afghanistan, and Baluchistan. This illustrious emperor, considered even by Western historians\nto have been an incomparable ruler, has left the following wisdom on a rock memorial:\nThis religious inscription has been engraved in order that our sons and grandsons may not think a new\nconquest is necessary; that they may not think conquest by the sword deserves the name of conquest; that they\nmay see in it nothing but destruction and violence; that they may consider nothing as true conquest save the\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 41.

Later Chandragupta destroyed the Macedonian garrisons left in\nIndia, defeated the invading Greek army of Seleucus in the Punjab, and then received at his Patna court the\nHellenic ambassador Megasthenes.\nIntensely interesting stories have been minutely recorded by Greek historians and others who accompanied or\nfollowed after Alexander in his expedition to India. The narratives of Arrian, Diodoros, Plutarch, and Strabo\nthe geographer have been translated by Dr. J. W. M'Crindle {FN41−3} to throw a shaft of light on ancient\nIndia. The most admirable feature of Alexander's unsuccessful invasion was the deep interest he displayed in\nHindu philosophy and in the yogis and holy men whom he encountered from time to time and whose society\nhe eagerly sought. Shortly after the Greek warrior had arrived in Taxila in northern India, he sent a messenger,\nOnesikritos, a disciple of the Hellenic school of Diogenes, to fetch an Indian teacher, Dandamis, a great\nsannyasi of Taxila.\n“Hail to thee, O teacher of Brahmins!” Onesikritos said after seeking out Dandamis in his forest retreat. “The\nson of the mighty God Zeus, being Alexander who is the Sovereign Lord of all men, asks you to go to him,\nand if you comply, he will reward you with great gifts, but if you refuse, he will cut off your head!”\nThe yogi received this fairly compulsive invitation calmly, and “did not so much as lift up his head from his\ncouch of leaves.”\n“I also am a son of Zeus, if Alexander be such,” he commented. “I want nothing that is Alexander's, for I am\ncontent with what I have, while I see that he wanders with his men over sea and land for no advantage, and is\nnever coming to an end of his wanderings.\n“Go and tell Alexander that God the Supreme King is never the Author of insolent wrong, but is the Creator\nof light, of peace, of life, of water, of the body of man and of souls; He receives all men when death sets them\nfree, being in no way subject to evil disease. He alone is the God of my homage, who abhors slaughter and\ninstigates no wars.\n“Alexander is no god, since he must taste of death,” continued the sage in quiet scorn. “How can such as he be\nthe world's master, when he has not yet seated himself on a throne of inner universal dominion? Neither as yet\nhas he entered living into Hades, nor does he know the course of the sun through the central regions of the\nearth, while the nations on its boundaries have not so much as heard his name!”\nAfter this chastisement, surely the most caustic ever sent to assault the ears of the “Lord of the World,” the\nsage added ironically, “If Alexander's present dominions be not capacious enough for his desires, let him\ncross the Ganges River; there he will find a region able to sustain all his men, if the country on this side be too\nnarrow to hold him. {FN41−4}\n“Know this, however, that what Alexander offers and the gifts he promises are things to me utterly useless;\nthe things I prize and find of real use and worth are these leaves which are my house, these blooming plants\nwhich supply me with daily food, and the water which is my drink; while all other possessions which are\namassed with anxious care are wont to prove ruinous to those who gather them, and cause only sorrow and\nvexation, with which every poor mortal is fully fraught.

Go then and tell\nAlexander this: Dandamis has no need of aught that is yours, and therefore will not go to you, and if you want\nanything from Dandamis, come you to him.”\nWith close attention Alexander received through Onesikritos the message from the yogi, and “felt a stronger\ndesire than ever to see Dandamis who, though old and naked, was the only antagonist in whom he, the\nconqueror of many nations, had met more than his match.”\nAlexander invited to Taxila a number of Brahmin ascetics noted for their skill in answering philosophical\nquestions with pithy wisdom.

This man was Swami Sphines, called\n“Kalanos” by the Greeks because the saint, a devotee of God in the form of Kali, greeted everyone by\npronouncing Her auspicious name.\nKalanos accompanied Alexander to Persia. On a stated day, at Susa in Persia, Kalanos gave up his aged body\nby entering a funeral pyre in view of the whole Macedonian army. The historians record the astonishment of\nthe soldiers who observed that the yogi had no fear of pain or death, and who never once moved from his\nposition as he was consumed in the flames. Before leaving for his cremation, Kalanos had embraced all his\nclose companions, but refrained from bidding farewell to Alexander, to whom the Hindu sage had merely\nremarked:\n“I shall see you shortly in Babylon.”\nAlexander left Persia, and died a year later in Babylon. His Indian guru's words had been his way of saying he\nwould be present with Alexander in life and death.\nThe Greek historians have left us many vivid and inspiring pictures of Indian society.

All\nothers are considered to be in great measure pernicious.” Engagement in war was restricted to the\nKSHATRIYAS or warrior caste. “Nor would an enemy coming upon a husbandman at his work on his land,\ndo him any harm, for men of this class being regarded as public benefactors, are protected from all injury. The\nland thus remaining unravaged and producing heavy crops, supplies the inhabitants with the requisites to\nmake life enjoyable.” {FN41−7}\nThe Emperor Chandragupta who in 305 B.C. had defeated Alexander's general, Seleucus, decided seven years\nlater to hand over the reins of India's government to his son.

For fifty−six days annually the\nMaharaja visits the temple thrice daily to hear Vedic hymns and recitations; the expiation ceremony ends with\nthe LAKSHADIPAM or illumination of the temple by a hundred thousand lights.\nThe great Hindu lawgiver Manu {FN41−8} has outlined the duties of a king. “He should shower amenities\nlike Indra (lord of the gods); collect taxes gently and imperceptibly as the sun obtains vapor from water; enter\ninto the life of his subjects as the wind goes everywhere; mete out even justice to all like Yama (god of death);\nbind transgressors in a noose like Varuna (Vedic deity of sky and wind); please all like the moon, burn up\nvicious enemies like the god of fire; and support all like the earth goddess.\n“In war a king should not fight with poisonous or fiery weapons nor kill weak or unready or weaponless foes\nor men who are in fear or who pray for protection or who run away. War should be resorted to only as a last\nresort. Results are always doubtful in war.”\nMadras Presidency on the southeast coast of India contains the flat, spacious, sea−girt city of Madras, and\nConjeeveram, the Golden City, capital site of the Pallava dynasty whose kings ruled during the early centuries\nof the Christian era. In modern Madras Presidency the nonviolent ideals of Mahatma Gandhi have made great\nheadway; the white distinguishing “Gandhi caps” are seen everywhere. In the south generally the Mahatma\nhas effected many important temple reforms for “untouchables” as well as caste−system reforms.\nThe origin of the caste system, formulated by the great legislator Manu, was admirable. He saw clearly that\nmen are distinguished by natural evolution into four great classes: those capable of offering service to society\nthrough their bodily labor (SUDRAS); those who serve through mentality, skill, agriculture, trade, commerce,\nbusiness life in general (VAISYAS); those whose talents are administrative, executive, and protective−rulers\nand warriors (KSHATRIYAS); those of contemplative nature, spiritually inspired and inspiring\n(BRAHMINS). “Neither birth nor sacraments nor study nor ancestry can decide whether a person is\ntwice−born (i.e., a BRAHMIN);” the MAHABHARATA declares, “character and conduct only can decide.”\n{FN41−9} Manu instructed society to show respect to its members insofar as they possessed wisdom, virtue,\nage, kinship or, lastly, wealth. Riches in Vedic India were always despised if they were hoarded or\nunavailable for charitable purposes. Ungenerous men of great wealth were assigned a low rank in society.\nSerious evils arose when the caste system became hardened through the centuries into a hereditary halter.\nSocial reformers like Gandhi and the members of very numerous societies in India today are making slow but\nsure progress in restoring the ancient values of caste, based solely on natural qualification and not on birth.\nEvery nation on earth has its own distinctive misery−producing karma to deal with and remove; India, too,\nwith her versatile and invulnerable spirit, shall prove herself equal to the task of caste−reformation.\nSo entrancing is southern India that Mr. Wright and I yearned to prolong our idyl. But time, in its immemorial\nrudeness, dealt us no courteous extensions. I was scheduled soon to address the concluding session of the\nIndian Philosophical Congress at Calcutta University. At the end of the visit to Mysore, I enjoyed a talk with\nSir C. V. Raman, president of the Indian Academy of Sciences. This brilliant Hindu physicist was awarded the\nNobel Prize in 1930 for his important discovery in the diffusion of light−the “Raman Effect” now known to\nevery schoolboy.\nWaving a reluctant farewell to a crowd of Madras students and friends, Mr. Wright and I set out for the north.\nOn the way we stopped before a little shrine sacred to the memory of Sadasiva Brahman, {FN41−10} in\nwhose eighteenth−century life story miracles cluster thickly.

Immersed one day in SAMADHI on the bank of the Kaveri River, Sadasiva was seen to be\ncarried away by a sudden flood. Weeks later he was found buried deep beneath a mound of earth. As the\nvillagers' shovels struck his body, the saint rose and walked briskly away.\nSadasiva never spoke a word or wore a cloth. One morning the nude yogi unceremoniously entered the tent of\na Mohammedan chieftain. His ladies screamed in alarm; the warrior dealt a savage sword thrust at Sadasiva,\nwhose arm was severed. The master departed unconcernedly. Overcome by remorse, the Mohammedan\npicked up the arm from the floor and followed Sadasiva. The yogi quietly inserted his arm into the bleeding\nstump. When the warrior humbly asked for some spiritual instruction, Sadasiva wrote with his finger on the\nsands:\n“Do not do what you want, and then you may do what you like.”\nThe Mohammedan was uplifted to an exalted state of mind, and understood the saint's paradoxical advice to\nbe a guide to soul freedom through mastery of the ego.\nThe village children once expressed a desire in Sadasiva's presence to see the Madura religious festival, 150\nmiles away. The yogi indicated to the little ones that they should touch his body. Lo! instantly the whole\ngroup was transported to Madura. The children wandered happily among the thousands of pilgrims. In a few\nhours the yogi brought his small charges home by his simple mode of transportation. The astonished parents\nheard the vivid tales of the procession of images, and noted that several children were carrying bags of\nMadura sweets.\nAn incredulous youth derided the saint and the story. The following morning he approached Sadasiva.\n“Master,” he said scornfully, “why don't you take me to the festival, even as you did yesterday for the other\nchildren?”\nSadasiva complied; the boy immediately found himself among the distant city throng. But alas! where was the\nsaint when the youth wanted to leave?

All systems of wise\nsocial regulations and even justice are patterned after Manu.

These four castes render service to humanity by (1) body, (2) mind, (3)\nwill power, (4) Spirit.\n“These four stages have their correspondence in the eternal GUNAS or qualities of nature, TAMAS, RAJAS,\nand SATTVA: obstruction, activity, and expansion; or, mass, energy, and intelligence. The four natural castes\nare marked by the GUNAS as (1) TAMAS (ignorance), (2) TAMAS−RAJAS (mixture of ignorance and\nactivity), (3) RAJAS−SATTVA (mixture of right activity and enlightenment), (4) SATTVA (enlightenment).\nThus has nature marked every man with his caste, by the predominance in himself of one, or the mixture of\ntwo, of the GUNAS. Of course every human being has all three GUNAS in varying proportions. The guru will\nbe able rightly to determine a man's caste or evolutionary status.\n“To a certain extent, all races and nations observe in practice, if not in theory, the features of caste. Where\nthere is great license or so−called liberty, particularly in intermarriage between extremes in the natural castes,\nthe race dwindles away and becomes extinct. The PURANA SAMHITA compares the offspring of such\nunions to barren hybrids, like the mule which is incapable of propagation of its own species. Artificial species\nare eventually exterminated. History offers abundant proof of numerous great races which no longer have any\nliving representatives. The caste system of India is credited by her most profound thinkers with being the\ncheck or preventive against license which has preserved the purity of the race and brought it safely through\nmillenniums of vicissitudes, while other races have vanished in oblivion.”\n{FN41−10} His full title was Sri Sadasivendra Saraswati Swami.

Sri Yukteswar glanced at me meekly.\n“What is your question?” Master looked about the room as though he were seeking escape.\n“Guruji, I came to you as a high−school youth; now I am a grown man, even with a gray hair or two. Though\nyou have showered me with silent affection from the first hour to this, do you realize that once only, on the\nday of meeting, have you ever said, 'I love you'?” I looked at him pleadingly.\nMaster lowered his gaze. “Yogananda, must I bring out into the cold realms of speech the warm sentiments\nbest guarded by the wordless heart?”\n“Guruji, I know you love me, but my mortal ears ache to hear you say so.”\n“Be it as you wish. During my married life I often yearned for a son, to train in the yogic path. But when you\ncame into my life, I was content; in you I have found my son.” Two clear teardrops stood in Sri Yukteswar's\neyes. “Yogananda, I love you always.”\n“Your answer is my passport to heaven.” I felt a weight lift from my heart, dissolved forever at his words.\nOften had I wondered at his silence. Realizing that he was unemotional and self−contained, yet sometimes I\nfeared I had been unsuccessful in fully satisfying him. His was a strange nature, never utterly to be known; a\nnature deep and still, unfathomable to the outer world, whose values he had long transcended.\nA few days later, when I spoke before a huge audience at Albert Hall in Calcutta, Sri Yukteswar consented to\nsit beside me on the platform, with the Maharaja of Santosh and the Mayor of Calcutta. Though Master made\nno remark to me, I glanced at him from time to time during my address, and thought I detected a pleased\ntwinkle in his eyes.\nThen came a talk before the alumni of Serampore College. As I gazed upon my old classmates, and as they\ngazed on their own “Mad Monk,” tears of joy showed unashamedly. My silver−tongued professor of\nphilosophy, Dr. Ghoshal, came forward to greet me, all our past misunderstandings dissolved by the alchemist\nTime.\nA Winter Solstice Festival was celebrated at the end of December in the Serampore hermitage. As always, Sri\nYukteswar's disciples gathered from far and near. Devotional SANKIRTANS, solos in the nectar−sweet voice\nof Kristo−da, a feast served by young disciples, Master's profoundly moving discourse under the stars in the\nthronged courtyard of the ashram−memories, memories! Joyous festivals of years long past! Tonight,\nhowever, there was to be a new feature.\n“Yogananda, please address the assemblage−in English.” Master's eyes were twinkling as he made this doubly\nunusual request; was he thinking of the shipboard predicament that had preceded my first lecture in English? I\ntold the story to my audience of brother disciples, ending with a fervent tribute to our guru.\n“His omnipresent guidance was with me not alone on the ocean steamer,” I concluded, “but daily throughout\nmy fifteen years in the vast and hospitable land of America.”\nAfter the guests had departed, Sri Yukteswar called me to the same bedroom where−once only, after a festival\nof my early years−I had been permitted to sleep on his wooden bed.

You will be able to successfully sail the boat of your life and that of the organization to the divine\nshores.”\nIn tears, I was embracing his feet; he rose and blessed me endearingly.\nThe following day I summoned from Ranchi a disciple, Swami Sebananda, and sent him to Puri to assume the\nhermitage duties. {FN42−3} Later my guru discussed with me the legal details of settling his estate; he was\nanxious to prevent the possibility of litigation by relatives, after his death, for possession of his two\nhermitages and other properties, which he wished to be deeded over solely for charitable purposes.\n“Arrangements were recently made for Master to visit Kidderpore, {FN42−4} but he failed to go.” Amulaya\nBabu, a brother disciple, made this remark to me one afternoon; I felt a cold wave of premonition. To my\npressing inquiries, Sri Yukteswar only replied, “I shall go to Kidderpore no more.” For a moment, Master\ntrembled like a frightened child.\n(“Attachment to bodily residence, springing up of its own nature [i.e., arising from immemorial roots, past\nexperiences of death],” Patanjali wrote, {FN42−5} “is present in slight degree even in great saints.” In some\nof his discourses on death, my guru had been wont to add: “Just as a long−caged bird hesitates to leave its\naccustomed home when the door is opened.”)\n“Guruji,” I entreated him with a sob, “don't say that!

The spiritual eye was vividly represented on their foreheads by a single\nspot of sandalwood paste. Shaven−headed swamis appeared by the thousands, ocher−robed and carrying their\nbamboo staff and begging bowl. Their faces beamed with the renunciate's peace as they walked about or held\nphilosophical discussions with disciples.\nHere and there under the trees, around huge piles of burning logs, were picturesque sadhus, {FN42−8} their\nhair braided and massed in coils on top of their heads. Some wore beards several feet in length, curled and tied\nin a knot. They meditated quietly, or extended their hands in blessing to the passing throng−beggars,\nmaharajas on elephants, women in multicolored SARIS—their bangles and anklets tinkling, FAKIRS with\nthin arms held grotesquely aloft, BRAHMACHARIS carrying meditation elbow−props, humble sages whose\nsolemnity hid an inner bliss.

Alighting from the car a short time later, we walked\nsome distance through the thickening smoke of the sadhus' fires and over the slippery sands to reach a cluster\nof tiny, very modest mud−and−straw huts. We halted in front of one of these insignificant temporary\ndwellings, with a pygmy doorless entrance, the shelter of Kara Patri, a young wandering sadhu noted for his\nexceptional intelligence. There he sat, cross−legged on a pile of straw, his only covering−and incidentally his\nonly possession−being an ocher cloth draped over his shoulders.\n“Truly a divine face smiled at us after we had crawled on all fours into the hut and PRONAMED at the feet of\nthis enlightened soul, while the kerosene lantern at the entrance flickered weird, dancing shadows on the\nthatched walls. His face, especially his eyes and perfect teeth, beamed and glistened. Although I was puzzled\nby the Hindi, his expressions were very revealing; he was full of enthusiasm, love, spiritual glory. No one\ncould be mistaken as to his greatness.\n“Imagine the happy life of one unattached to the material world; free of the clothing problem; free of food\ncraving, never begging, never touching cooked food except on alternate days, never carrying a begging bowl;\nfree of all money entanglements, never handling money, never storing things away, always trusting in God;\nfree of transportation worries, never riding in vehicles, but always walking on the banks of the sacred rivers;\nnever remaining in one place longer than a week in order to avoid any growth of attachment.\n“Such a modest soul! unusually learned in the VEDAS, and possessing an M.A. degree and the title of\nSHASTRI (master of scriptures) from Benares University. A sublime feeling pervaded me as I sat at his feet;\nit all seemed to be an answer to my desire to see the real, the ancient India, for he is a true representative of\nthis land of spiritual giants.”\nI questioned Kara Patri about his wandering life. “Don't you have any extra clothes for winter?”\n“No, this is enough.”\n“Do you carry any books?”\n“No, I teach from memory those people who wish to hear me.”\n“What else do you do?”\n“I roam by the Ganges.”\nAt these quiet words, I was overpowered by a yearning for the simplicity of his life. I remembered America,\nand all the responsibilities that lay on my shoulders.\n“No, Yogananda,” I thought, sadly for a moment, “in this life roaming by the Ganges is not for you.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 42.

I had never forgotten Sri Yukteswar's\nrequest that I write the life of Lahiri Mahasaya. During my stay in India I was taking every opportunity of\ncontacting direct disciples and relatives of the Yogavatar. Recording their conversations in voluminous notes,\nI verified facts and dates, and collected photographs, old letters, and documents. My Lahiri Mahasaya\nportfolio began to swell; I realized with dismay that ahead of me lay arduous labors in authorship. I prayed\nthat I might be equal to my role as biographer of the colossal guru. Several of his disciples feared that in a\nwritten account their master might be belittled or misinterpreted.\n“One can hardly do justice in cold words to the life of a divine incarnation,” Panchanon Bhattacharya had\nonce remarked to me.\nOther close disciples were similarly satisfied to keep the Yogavatar hidden in their hearts as the deathless\npreceptor. Nevertheless, mindful of Lahiri Mahasaya's prediction about his biography, I spared no effort to\nsecure and substantiate the facts of his outward life.\nSwami Keshabananda greeted our party warmly at Brindaban in his Katayani Peith Ashram, an imposing\nbrick building with massive black pillars, set in a beautiful garden. He ushered us at once into a sitting room\nadorned with an enlargement of Lahiri Mahasaya's picture. The swami was approaching the age of ninety, but\nhis muscular body radiated strength and health. With long hair and a snow−white beard, eyes twinkling with\njoy, he was a veritable patriarchal embodiment. I informed him that I wanted to mention his name in my book\non India's masters.\n“Please tell me about your earlier life.” I smiled entreatingly; great yogis are often uncommunicative.\nKeshabananda made a gesture of humility. “There is little of external moment. Practically my whole life has\nbeen spent in the Himalayan solitudes, traveling on foot from one quiet cave to another. For a while I\nmaintained a small ashram outside Hardwar, surrounded on all sides by a grove of tall trees. It was a peaceful\nspot little visited by travelers, owing to the ubiquitous presence of cobras.” Keshabananda chuckled. “Later a\nGanges flood washed away the hermitage and cobras alike.

He used to joke with me over my ceaseless\ntravels in the Himalayan wilderness.\n“'You have the mark of wanderlust on your foot,' he told me once. 'I am glad that the sacred Himalayas are\nextensive enough to engross you.'\n“Many times,” Keshabananda went on, “both before and after his passing, Lahiri Mahasaya has appeared\nbodily before me.

Less than\na year of Indian hospitality, and I had gained fifty pounds! Yet it would have been considered the height of\nrudeness to refuse any of the dishes, carefully prepared for the endless banquets in my honor. In India\n(nowhere else, alas!) a well−padded swami is considered a delightful sight. {FN42−10}\n[Illustration: Mr. Wright, myself, Miss Bletch—in Egypt—see camel.jpg]\n[Illustration: Rabindranath Tagore, inspired poet of Bengal, and Nobel Prizeman in literature—see tagore.jpg]\n[Illustration: Mr. Wright and I pose with the venerable Swami Keshabananda and a disciple at the stately\nhermitage in Brindaban—see keshabananda.jpg]\nAfter dinner, Keshabananda led me to a secluded nook.\n“Your arrival is not unexpected,” he said. “I have a message for you.”\nI was surprised; no one had known of my plan to visit Keshabananda.\n“While roaming last year in the northern Himalayas near Badrinarayan,” the swami continued, “I lost my way.\nShelter appeared in a spacious cave, which was empty, though the embers of a fire glowed in a hole in the\nrocky floor. Wondering about the occupant of this lonely retreat, I sat near the fire, my gaze fixed on the sunlit\nentrance to the cave.\n“'Keshabananda, I am glad you are here.' These words came from behind me. I turned, startled, and was\ndazzled to behold Babaji! The great guru had materialized himself in a recess of the cave. Overjoyed to see\nhim again after many years, I prostrated myself at his holy feet.\n“'I called you here,' Babaji went on. 'That is why you lost your way and were led to my temporary abode in\nthis cave. It is a long time since our last meeting; I am pleased to greet you once more.'\n“The deathless master blessed me with some words of spiritual help, then added: 'I give you a message for\nYogananda. He will pay you a visit on his return to India. Many matters connected with his guru and with the\nsurviving disciples of Lahiri will keep Yogananda fully occupied. Tell him, then, that I won't see him this\ntime, as he is eagerly hoping; but I shall see him on some other occasion.'“\nI was deeply touched to receive from Keshabananda's lips this consoling promise from Babaji.

Riding\nover a bridge of the Jumna River, we enjoyed a magnificent view of the skyline of Brindaban just as the sun\nset fire to the sky−a veritable furnace of Vulcan in color, reflected below us in the still waters.\nThe Jumna beach is hallowed by memories of the child Sri Krishna. Here he engaged with innocent sweetness\nin his LILAS (plays) with the GOPIS (maids), exemplifying the supernal love which ever exists between a\ndivine incarnation and his devotees. The life of Lord Krishna has been misunderstood by many Western\ncommentators. Scriptural allegory is baffling to literal minds. A hilarious blunder by a translator will illustrate\nthis point. The story concerns an inspired medieval saint, the cobbler Ravidas, who sang in the simple terms\nof his own trade of the spiritual glory hidden in all mankind:\n  Under the vast vault of blue\n  Lives the divinity clothed in hide.\nOne turns aside to hide a smile on hearing the pedestrian interpretation given to Ravidas' poem by a Western\nwriter:\n“He afterwards built a hut, set up in it an idol which he made from a hide, and applied himself to its worship.”\nRavidas was a brother disciple of the great Kabir. One of Ravidas' exalted chelas was the Rani of Chitor. She\ninvited a large number of Brahmins to a feast in honor of her teacher, but they refused to eat with a lowly\ncobbler. As they sat down in dignified aloofness to eat their own uncontaminated meal, lo! each Brahmin\nfound at his side the form of Ravidas. This mass vision accomplished a widespread spiritual revival in Chitor.\nIn a few days our little group reached Calcutta. Eager to see Sri Yukteswar, I was disappointed to hear that he\nhad left Serampore and was now in Puri, about three hundred miles to the south.\n“Come to Puri ashram at once.” This telegram was sent on March 8th by a brother disciple to Atul Chandra\nRoy Chowdhry, one of Master's chelas in Calcutta. News of the message reached my ears; anguished at its\nimplications, I dropped to my knees and implored God that my guru's life be spared. As I was about to leave\nFather's home for the train, a divine voice spoke within.\n“Do not go to Puri tonight. Thy prayer cannot he granted.”\n“Lord,” I said, grief−stricken, “Thou dost not wish to engage with me in a 'tug of war' at Puri, where Thou\nwilt have to deny my incessant prayers for Master's life. Must he, then, depart for higher duties at Thy\nbehest?”\nIn obedience to the inward command, I did not leave that night for Puri. The following evening I set out for\nthe train; on the way, at seven o'clock, a black astral cloud suddenly covered the sky. {FN42−11} Later, while\nthe train roared toward Puri, a vision of Sri Yukteswar appeared before me. He was sitting, very grave of\ncountenance, with a light on each side.\n“Is it all over?” I lifted my arms beseechingly.\nHe nodded, then slowly vanished.\nAs I stood on the Puri train platform the following morning, still hoping against hope, an unknown man\napproached me.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 42.

Seething with rebellion, my soul was like a volcano. By the time I reached the Puri\nhermitage I was nearing collapse. The inner voice was tenderly repeating: “Collect yourself. Be calm.”\nI entered the ashram room where Master's body, unimaginably lifelike, was sitting in the lotus posture−a\npicture of health and loveliness. A short time before his passing, my guru had been slightly ill with fever, but\nbefore the day of his ascension into the Infinite, his body had become completely well. No matter how often I\nlooked at his dear form I could not realize that its life had departed. His skin was smooth and soft; in his face\nwas a beatific expression of tranquillity. He had consciously relinquished his body at the hour of mystic\nsummoning.\n“The Lion of Bengal is gone!” I cried in a daze.\nI conducted the solemn rites on March 10th. Sri Yukteswar was buried {FN42−12} with the ancient rituals of\nthe swamis in the garden of his Puri ashram. His disciples later arrived from far and near to honor their guru at\na vernal equinox memorial service. The AMRITA BAZAR PATRIKA, leading newspaper of Calcutta, carried\nhis picture and the following report:\nThe death BHANDARA ceremony for Srimat Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri Maharaj, aged 81, took place at Puri\non March 21. Many disciples came down to Puri for the rites.\nOne of the greatest expounders of the BHAGAVAD GITA, Swami Maharaj was a great disciple of Yogiraj\nSri Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya of Benares. Swami Maharaj was the founder of several Yogoda\nSat−Sanga (Self−Realization Fellowship) centers in India, and was the great inspiration behind the yoga\nmovement which was carried to the West by Swami Yogananda, his principal disciple. It was Sri\nYukteswarji's prophetic powers and deep realization that inspired Swami Yogananda to cross the oceans and\nspread in America the message of the masters of India.\nHis interpretations of the BHAGAVAD GITA and other scriptures testify to the depth of Sri Yukteswarji's\ncommand of the philosophy, both Eastern and Western, and remain as an eye−opener for the unity between\nOrient and Occident. As he believed in the unity of all religious faiths, Sri Yukteswar Maharaj established\nSADHU SABHA (Society of Saints) with the cooperation of leaders of various sects and faiths, for the\ninculcation of a scientific spirit in religion. At the time of his demise he nominated Swami Yogananda his\nsuccessor as the president of SADHU SABHA.\nIndia is really poorer today by the passing of such a great man. May all fortunate enough to have come near\nhim inculcate in themselves the true spirit of India's culture and SADHANA which was personified in him.\nI returned to Calcutta. Not trusting myself as yet to go to the Serampore hermitage with its sacred memories, I\nsummoned Prafulla, Sri Yukteswar's little disciple in Serampore, and made arrangements for him to enter the\nRanchi school.\n“The morning you left for the Allahabad MELA,” Prafulla told me, “Master dropped heavily on the\ndavenport.\n“'Yogananda is gone!' he cried. 'Yogananda is gone!' He added cryptically, 'I shall have to tell him some other\nway.' He sat then for hours in silence.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 42. LAST DAYS WITH MY GURU\n236\n"}

The\nChinese author relates: “Throughout the country no one kills any living thing, nor drinks wine. . . .

Though I see it as ethereal, to your sight it is\nphysical. From the cosmic atoms I created an entirely new body, exactly like that cosmic−dream physical\nbody which you laid beneath the dream−sands at Puri in your dream−world. I am in truth resurrected−not on\nearth but on an astral planet. Its inhabitants are better able than earthly humanity to meet my lofty standards.\nThere you and your exalted loved ones shall someday come to be with me.”\n“Deathless guru, tell me more!”\nMaster gave a quick, mirthful chuckle. “Please, dear one,” he said, “won't you relax your hold a little?”\n“Only a little!” I had been embracing him with an octopus grip. I could detect the same faint, fragrant, natural\nodor which had been characteristic of his body before. The thrilling touch of his divine flesh still persists\naround the inner sides of my arms and in my palms whenever I recall those glorious hours.\n“As prophets are sent on earth to help men work out their physical karma, so I have been directed by God to\nserve on an astral planet as a savior,” Sri Yukteswar explained. “It is called HIRANYALOKA or 'Illumined\nAstral Planet.' There I am aiding advanced beings to rid themselves of astral karma and thus attain liberation\nfrom astral rebirths. The dwellers on Hiranyaloka are highly developed spiritually; all of them had acquired, in\ntheir last earth−incarnation, the meditation−given power of consciously leaving their physical bodies at death.\nNo one can enter Hiranyaloka unless he has passed on earth beyond the state of SABIKALPA SAMADHI\ninto the higher state of NIRBIKALPA SAMADHI. {FN43−1}\n“The Hiranyaloka inhabitants have already passed through the ordinary astral spheres, where nearly all beings\nfrom earth must go at death; there they worked out many seeds of their past actions in the astral worlds.

The entire physical creation hangs like a little solid basket under the huge luminous balloon\nof the astral sphere. Just as many physical suns and stars roam in space, so there are also countless astral solar\nand stellar systems. Their planets have astral suns and moons, more beautiful than the physical ones. The\nastral luminaries resemble the aurora borealis−the sunny astral aurora being more dazzling than the\nmild−rayed moon−aurora. The astral day and night are longer than those of earth.\n“The astral world is infinitely beautiful, clean, pure, and orderly. There are no dead planets or barren lands.\nThe terrestrial blemishes—weeds, bacteria, insects, snakes−are absent. Unlike the variable climates and\nseasons of the earth, the astral planets maintain the even temperature of an eternal spring, with occasional\nluminous white snow and rain of many−colored lights. Astral planets abound in opal lakes and bright seas and\nrainbow rivers.\n“The ordinary astral universe−not the subtler astral heaven of Hiranyaloka−is peopled with millions of astral\nbeings who have come, more or less recently, from the earth, and also with myriads of fairies, mermaids,\nfishes, animals, goblins, gnomes, demigods and spirits, all residing on different astral planets in accordance\nwith karmic qualifications. Various spheric mansions or vibratory regions are provided for good and evil\nspirits. Good ones can travel freely, but the evil spirits are confined to limited zones. In the same way that\nhuman beings live on the surface of the earth, worms inside the soil, fish in water, and birds in air, so astral\nbeings of different grades are assigned to suitable vibratory quarters.\n“Among the fallen dark angels expelled from other worlds, friction and war take place with lifetronic bombs\nor mental MANTRIC {FN43−3} vibratory rays. These beings dwell in the gloom−drenched regions of the\nlower astral cosmos, working out their evil karma.\n“In the vast realms above the dark astral prison, all is shining and beautiful. The astral cosmos is more\nnaturally attuned than the earth to the divine will and plan of perfection. Every astral object is manifested\nprimarily by the will of God, and partially by the will−call of astral beings. They possess the power of\nmodifying or enhancing the grace and form of anything already created by the Lord. He has given His astral\nchildren the freedom and privilege of changing or improving at will the astral cosmos. On earth a solid must\nbe transformed into liquid or other form through natural or chemical processes, but astral solids are changed\ninto astral liquids, gases, or energy solely and instantly by the will of the inhabitants.\n“The earth is dark with warfare and murder in the sea, land, and air,” my guru continued, “but the astral\nrealms know a happy harmony and equality. Astral beings dematerialize or materialize their forms at will.\nFlowers or fish or animals can metamorphose themselves, for a time, into astral men. All astral beings are free\nto assume any form, and can easily commune together. No fixed, definite, natural law hems them round−any\nastral tree, for example, can be successfully asked to produce an astral mango or other desired fruit, flower, or\nindeed any other object.

They possess three eyes, two of which are partly closed. The\nthird and chief astral eye, vertically placed on the forehead, is open. Astral beings have all the outer sensory\norgans−ears, eyes, nose, tongue, and skin−but they employ the intuitional sense to experience sensations\nthrough any part of the body; they can see through the ear, or nose, or skin.

Just as worldly men\ndon new array for gala events, so astral beings find occasions to bedeck themselves in specially designed\nforms.\n“Joyous astral festivities on the higher astral planets like Hiranyaloka take place when a being is liberated\nfrom the astral world through spiritual advancement, and is therefore ready to enter the heaven of the causal\nworld. On such occasions the Invisible Heavenly Father, and the saints who are merged in Him, materialize\nThemselves into bodies of Their own choice and join the astral celebration. In order to please His beloved\ndevotee, the Lord takes any desired form. If the devotee worshiped through devotion, he sees God as the\nDivine Mother.

Although dwellers on the heavenly planets like Hiranyaloka are almost freed\nfrom any necessity of eating, still higher is the unconditioned existence of almost completely liberated souls in\nthe causal world, who eat nothing save the manna of bliss.\n“The earth−liberated astral being meets a multitude of relatives, fathers, mothers, wives, husbands, and\nfriends, acquired during different incarnations on earth, {FN43−5} as they appear from time to time in various\nparts of the astral realms. He is therefore at a loss to understand whom to love especially; he learns in this way\nto give a divine and equal love to all, as children and individualized expressions of God. Though the outward\nappearance of loved ones may have changed, more or less according to the development of new qualities in\nthe latest life of any particular soul, the astral being employs his unerring intuition to recognize all those once\ndear to him in other planes of existence, and to welcome them to their new astral home. Because every atom\nin creation is inextinguishably dowered with individuality, {FN43−6} an astral friend will be recognized no\nmatter what costume he may don, even as on earth an actor's identity is discoverable by close observation\ndespite any disguise.\n“The span of life in the astral world is much longer than on earth. A normal advanced astral being's average\nlife period is from five hundred to one thousand years, measured in accordance with earthly standards of time.\nAs certain redwood trees outlive most trees by millenniums, or as some yogis live several hundred years\nthough most men die before the age of sixty, so some astral beings live much longer than the usual span of\nastral existence. Visitors to the astral world dwell there for a longer or shorter period in accordance with the\nweight of their physical karma, which draws them back to earth within a specified time.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 43.

The astral world is free from unwilling death, disease, and old age. These three dreads are\nthe curse of earth, where man has allowed his consciousness to identify itself almost wholly with a frail\nphysical body requiring constant aid from air, food, and sleep in order to exist at all.\n“Physical death is attended by the disappearance of breath and the disintegration of fleshly cells. Astral death\nconsists of the dispersement of lifetrons, those manifest units of energy which constitute the life of astral\nbeings. At physical death a being loses his consciousness of flesh and becomes aware of his subtle body in the\nastral world. Experiencing astral death in due time, a being thus passes from the consciousness of astral birth\nand death to that of physical birth and death. These recurrent cycles of astral and physical encasement are the\nineluctable destiny of all unenlightened beings. Scriptural definitions of heaven and hell sometimes stir man's\ndeeper−than−subconscious memories of his long series of experiences in the blithesome astral and\ndisappointing terrestrial worlds.”\n“Beloved Master,” I asked, “will you please describe more in detail the difference between rebirth on the earth\nand in the astral and causal spheres?”\n“Man as an individualized soul is essentially causal−bodied,” my guru explained. “That body is a matrix of\nthe thirty−five IDEAS required by God as the basic or causal thought forces from which He later formed the\nsubtle astral body of nineteen elements and the gross physical body of sixteen elements.\n“The nineteen elements of the astral body are mental, emotional, and lifetronic. The nineteen components are\nintelligence; ego; feeling; mind (sense−consciousness); five instruments of KNOWLEDGE, the subtle\ncounterparts of the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch; five instruments of ACTION, the mental\ncorrespondence for the executive abilities to procreate, excrete, talk, walk, and exercise manual skill; and five\ninstruments of LIFE FORCE, those empowered to perform the crystallizing, assimilating, eliminating,\nmetabolizing, and circulating functions of the body. This subtle astral encasement of nineteen elements\nsurvives the death of the physical body, which is made of sixteen gross metallic and nonmetallic elements.\n“God thought out different ideas within Himself and projected them into dreams. Lady Cosmic Dream thus\nsprang out decorated in all her colossal endless ornaments of relativity.\n“In thirty−five thought categories of the causal body, God elaborated all the complexities of man's nineteen\nastral and sixteen physical counterparts. By condensation of vibratory forces, first subtle, then gross, He\nproduced man's astral body and finally his physical form. According to the law of relativity, by which the\nPrime Simplicity has become the bewildering manifold, the causal cosmos and causal body are different from\nthe astral cosmos and astral body; the physical cosmos and physical body are likewise characteristically at\nvariance with the other forms of creation.\n“The fleshly body is made of the fixed, objectified dreams of the Creator. The dualities are ever−present on\nearth: disease and health, pain and pleasure, loss and gain. Human beings find limitation and resistance in\nthree−dimensional matter. When man's desire to live is severely shaken by disease or other causes, death\narrives; the heavy overcoat of the flesh is temporarily shed. The soul, however, remains encased in the astral\nand causal bodies. {FN43−7} The adhesive force by which all three bodies are held together is desire. The\npower of unfulfilled desires is the root of all man's slavery.\n“Physical desires are rooted in egotism and sense pleasures. The compulsion or temptation of sensory\nexperience is more powerful than the desire−force connected with astral attachments or causal perceptions.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 43.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 247, "text": "“Astral desires center around enjoyment in terms of vibration. Astral beings enjoy the ethereal music of the\nspheres and are entranced by the sight of all creation as exhaustless expressions of changing light. The astral\nbeings also smell, taste, and touch light. Astral desires are thus connected with an astral being's power to\nprecipitate all objects and experiences as forms of light or as condensed thoughts or dreams.\n“Causal desires are fulfilled by perception only. The nearly−free beings who are encased only in the causal\nbody see the whole universe as realizations of the dream−ideas of God; they can materialize anything and\neverything in sheer thought. Causal beings therefore consider the enjoyment of physical sensations or astral\ndelights as gross and suffocating to the soul's fine sensibilities. Causal beings work out their desires by\nmaterializing them instantly. {FN43−8} Those who find themselves covered only by the delicate veil of the\ncausal body can bring universes into manifestation even as the Creator. Because all creation is made of the\ncosmic dream−texture, the soul thinly clothed in the causal has vast realizations of power.\n“A soul, being invisible by nature, can be distinguished only by the presence of its body or bodies. The mere\npresence of a body signifies that its existence is made possible by unfulfilled desires. {FN43−9}\n“So long as the soul of man is encased in one, two, or three body−containers, sealed tightly with the corks of\nignorance and desires, he cannot merge with the sea of Spirit. When the gross physical receptacle is destroyed\nby the hammer of death, the other two coverings−astral and causal−still remain to prevent the soul from\nconsciously joining the Omnipresent Life. When desirelessness is attained through wisdom, its power\ndisintegrates the two remaining vessels. The tiny human soul emerges, free at last; it is one with the\nMeasureless Amplitude.”\nI asked my divine guru to shed further light on the high and mysterious causal world.\n“The causal world is indescribably subtle,” he replied. “In order to understand it, one would have to possess\nsuch tremendous powers of concentration that he could close his eyes and visualize the astral cosmos and the\nphysical cosmos in all their vastness−the luminous balloon with the solid basket−as existing in ideas only. If\nby this superhuman concentration one succeeded in converting or resolving the two cosmoses with all their\ncomplexities into sheer ideas, he would then reach the causal world and stand on the borderline of fusion\nbetween mind and matter. There one perceives all created things—solids, liquids, gases, electricity, energy, all\nbeings, gods, men, animals, plants, bacteria−as forms of consciousness, just as a man can close his eyes and\nrealize that he exists, even though his body is invisible to his physical eyes and is present only as an idea.\n“Whatever a human being can do in fancy, a causal being can do in reality. The most colossal imaginative\nhuman intelligence is able, in mind only, to range from one extreme of thought to another, to skip mentally\nfrom planet to planet, or tumble endlessly down a pit of eternity, or soar rocketlike into the galaxied canopy,\nor scintillate like a searchlight over milky ways and the starry spaces. But beings in the causal world have a\nmuch greater freedom, and can effortlessly manifest their thoughts into instant objectivity, without any\nmaterial or astral obstruction or karmic limitation.\n“Causal beings realize that the physical cosmos is not primarily constructed of electrons, nor is the astral\ncosmos basically composed of lifetrons−both in reality are created from the minutest particles of\nGod−thought, chopped and divided by MAYA, the law of relativity which intervenes to apparently separate\nthe Noumenon from His phenomena.\n“Souls in the causal world recognize one another as individualized points of joyous Spirit; their\nthought−things are the only objects which surround them. Causal beings see the difference between their\nbodies and thoughts to be merely ideas. As a man, closing his eyes, can visualize a dazzling white light or a\nfaint blue haze, so causal beings by thought alone are able to see, hear, feel, taste, and touch; they create\nanything, or dissolve it, by the power of cosmic mind.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 43.

By deeper ecstasies the freed soul then\nwithdraws itself from the little causal body and puts on the vastness of the causal cosmos. All the separate\neddies of ideas, particularized waves of power, love, will, joy, peace, intuition, calmness, self−control, and\nconcentration melt into the ever−joyous Sea of Bliss. No longer does the soul have to experience its joy as an\nindividualized wave of consciousness, but is merged in the One Cosmic Ocean, with all its waves−eternal\nlaughter, thrills, throbs.\n“When a soul is out of the cocoon of the three bodies it escapes forever from the law of relativity and becomes\nthe ineffable Ever−Existent. {FN43−10} Behold the butterfly of Omnipresence, its wings etched with stars\nand moons and suns!

Christ had won this final freedom even before he was born as\nJesus. In three stages of his past, symbolized in his earth−life as the three days of his experience of death and\nresurrection, he had attained the power to fully arise in Spirit.\n“The undeveloped man must undergo countless earthly and astral and causal incarnations in order to emerge\nfrom his three bodies. A master who achieves this final freedom may elect to return to earth as a prophet to\nbring other human beings back to God, or like myself he may choose to reside in the astral cosmos. There a\nsavior assumes some of the burden of the inhabitants' karma {FN43−11} and thus helps them to terminate\ntheir cycle of reincarnation in the astral cosmos and go on permanently to the causal spheres. Or a freed soul\nmay enter the causal world to aid its beings to shorten their span in the causal body and thus attain the\nAbsolute Freedom.”\n“Resurrected One, I want to know more about the karma which forces souls to return to the three worlds.” I\ncould listen forever, I thought, to my omniscient Master. Never in his earth−life had I been able at one time to\nassimilate so much of his wisdom. Now for the first time I was receiving a clear, definite insight into the\nenigmatic interspaces on the checkerboard of life and death.\n“The physical karma or desires of man must be completely worked out before his permanent stay in astral\nworlds becomes possible,” my guru elucidated in his thrilling voice. “Two kinds of beings live in the astral\nspheres. Those who still have earthly karma to dispose of and who must therefore reinhabit a gross physical\nbody in order to pay their karmic debts could be classified, after physical death, as temporary visitors to the\nastral world rather than as permanent residents.\n“Beings with unredeemed earthly karma are not permitted after astral death to go to the high causal sphere of\ncosmic ideas, but must shuttle to and fro from the physical and astral worlds only, conscious successively of\ntheir physical body of sixteen gross elements, and of their astral body of nineteen subtle elements. After each\nloss of his physical body, however, an undeveloped being from the earth remains for the most part in the deep\nstupor of the death−sleep and is hardly conscious of the beautiful astral sphere. After the astral rest, such a\nman returns to the material plane for further lessons, gradually accustoming himself, through repeated\njourneys, to the worlds of subtle astral texture.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 43.

Shedding the thought−form of the causal body at the end of a certain span, determined by cosmic law,\nthese advanced beings then return to Hiranyaloka or a similar high astral planet, reborn in a new astral body to\nwork out their unredeemed astral karma.\n“My son, you may now comprehend more fully that I am resurrected by divine decree,” Sri Yukteswar\ncontinued, “as a savior of astrally reincarnating souls coming back from the causal sphere, in particular, rather\nthan of those astral beings who are coming up from the earth. Those from the earth, if they still retain vestiges\nof material karma, do not rise to the very high astral planets like Hiranyaloka.\n“Just as most people on earth have not learned through meditation−acquired vision to appreciate the superior\njoys and advantages of astral life and thus, after death, desire to return to the limited, imperfect pleasures of\nearth, so many astral beings, during the normal disintegration of their astral bodies, fail to picture the\nadvanced state of spiritual joy in the causal world and, dwelling on thoughts of the more gross and gaudy\nastral happiness, yearn to revisit the astral paradise. Heavy astral karma must be redeemed by such beings\nbefore they can achieve after astral death a permanent stay in the causal thought−world, so thinly partitioned\nfrom the Creator.\n“Only when a being has no further desires for experiences in the pleasing−to−the−eye astral cosmos, and\ncannot be tempted to go back there, does he remain in the causal world. Completing there the work of\nredeeming all causal karma or seeds of past desires, the confined soul thrusts out the last of the three corks of\nignorance and, emerging from the final jar of the causal body, commingles with the Eternal.\n“Now do you understand?” Master smiled so enchantingly!\n“Yes, through your grace.

Visualizing or willing, he is working mainly through his astral body. His causal\nmedium finds expression when man is thinking or diving deep in introspection or meditation; the cosmical\nthoughts of genius come to the man who habitually contacts his causal body. In this sense an individual may\nbe classified broadly as 'a material man,' 'an energetic man,' or 'an intellectual man.'\n“A man identifies himself about sixteen hours daily with his physical vehicle. Then he sleeps; if he dreams, he\nremains in his astral body, effortlessly creating any object even as do the astral beings. If man's sleep be deep\nand dreamless, for several hours he is able to transfer his consciousness, or sense of I−ness, to the causal\nbody; such sleep is revivifying. A dreamer is contacting his astral and not his causal body; his sleep is not\nfully refreshing.”\nI had been lovingly observing Sri Yukteswar while he gave his wondrous exposition.\n“Angelic guru,” I said, “your body looks exactly as it did when last I wept over it in the Puri ashram.”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 43.

On the\nevening of March 16, 1936, Ma arrived at the ashram and asked to see her guru.\n“Why, Master died a week ago!” Swami Sebananda, now in charge of the Puri hermitage, looked at her sadly.\n“That's impossible!” She smiled a little. “Perhaps you are just trying to protect the guru from insistent\nvisitors?”\n“No.” Sebananda recounted details of the burial. “Come,” he said, “I will take you to the front garden to Sri\nYukteswarji's grave.”\nMa shook her head. “There is no grave for him!

A community chorus of prayer; then a meal\nserved from large brass pots containing CHAPATIS (whole−wheat unleavened bread) sprinkled with GHEE;\nTALSARI (boiled and diced vegetables), and a lemon jam.\nThe Mahatma ate CHAPATIS, boiled beets, some raw vegetables, and oranges. On the side of his plate was a\nlarge lump of very bitter NEEM leaves, a notable blood cleanser. With his spoon he separated a portion and\nplaced it on my dish. I bolted it down with water, remembering childhood days when Mother had forced me to\nswallow the disagreeable dose. Gandhi, however, bit by bit was eating the NEEM paste with as much relish as\nif it had been a delicious sweetmeat.\nIn this trifling incident I noted the Mahatma's ability to detach his mind from the senses at will. I recalled the\nfamous appendectomy performed on him some years ago. Refusing anesthetics, the saint had chatted\ncheerfully with his disciples throughout the operation, his infectious smile revealing his unawareness of pain.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 44.

A group of us go every morning at five o'clock to serve the near−by\nvillagers and teach them simple hygiene. We make it a point to clean their latrines and their mud−thatched\nhuts. The villagers are illiterate; they cannot be educated except by example!” She laughed gaily.\nI looked in admiration at this highborn Englishwoman whose true Christian humility enables her to do the\nscavengering work usually performed only by “untouchables.”\n“I came to India in 1925,” she told me. “In this land I feel that I have 'come back home.' Now I would never\nbe willing to return to my old life and old interests.”\nWe discussed America for awhile. “I am always pleased and amazed,” she said, “to see the deep interest in\nspiritual subjects exhibited by the many Americans who visit India.” {FN44−4}\nMirabai's hands were soon busy at the CHARKA (spinning wheel), omnipresent in all the ashram rooms and,\nindeed, due to the Mahatma, omnipresent throughout rural India.\nGandhi has sound economic and cultural reasons for encouraging the revival of cottage industries, but he does\nnot counsel a fanatical repudiation of all modern progress. Machinery, trains, automobiles, the telegraph have\nplayed important parts in his own colossal life! Fifty years of public service, in prison and out, wrestling daily\nwith practical details and harsh realities in the political world, have only increased his balance,\nopen−mindedness, sanity, and humorous appreciation of the quaint human spectacle.\nOur trio enjoyed a six o'clock supper as guests of Babasaheb Deshmukh. The 7:00 P.M. prayer hour found us\nback at the MAGANVADI ashram, climbing to the roof where thirty SATYAGRAHIS were grouped in a\nsemicircle around Gandhi. He was squatting on a straw mat, an ancient pocket watch propped up before him.\nThe fading sun cast a last gleam over the palms and banyans; the hum of night and the crickets had started.\nThe atmosphere was serenity itself; I was enraptured.\nA solemn chant led by Mr. Desai, with responses from the group; then a GITA reading. The Mahatma\nmotioned to me to give the concluding prayer. Such divine unison of thought and aspiration! A memory\nforever: the Wardha roof top meditation under the early stars.\nPunctually at eight o'clock Gandhi ended his silence. The herculean labors of his life require him to apportion\nhis time minutely.\n“Welcome, Swamiji!” The Mahatma's greeting this time was not via paper. We had just descended from the\nroof to his writing room, simply furnished with square mats (no chairs), a low desk with books, papers, and a\nfew ordinary pens (not fountain pens); a nondescript clock ticked in a corner. An all−pervasive aura of peace\nand devotion. Gandhi was bestowing one of his captivating, cavernous, almost toothless smiles.\n“Years ago,” he explained, “I started my weekly observance of a day of silence as a means for gaining time to\nlook after my correspondence. But now those twenty−four hours have become a vital spiritual need. A\nperiodical decree of silence is not a torture but a blessing.”\nI agreed wholeheartedly. {FN44−5} The Mahatma questioned me about America and Europe; we discussed\nIndia and world conditions.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 44.

At\nten−thirty we were called to the ashram porch for lunch with Gandhi and the SATYAGRAHIS. Today the\nmenu included brown rice, a new selection of vegetables, and cardamom seeds.\nNoon found me strolling about the ashram grounds, on to the grazing land of a few imperturbable cows. The\nprotection of cows is a passion with Gandhi.\n“The cow to me means the entire sub−human world, extending man's sympathies beyond his own species,”\nthe Mahatma has explained. “Man through the cow is enjoined to realize his identity with all that lives. Why\nthe ancient rishis selected the cow for apotheosis is obvious to me. The cow in India was the best comparison;\nshe was the giver of plenty. Not only did she give milk, but she also made agriculture possible. The cow is a\npoem of pity; one reads pity in the gentle animal. She is the second mother to millions of mankind. Protection\nof the cow means protection of the whole dumb creation of God. The appeal of the lower order of creation is\nall the more forceful because it is speechless.”\nThree daily rituals are enjoined on the orthodox Hindu. One is BHUTA YAJNA, an offering of food to the\nanimal kingdom. This ceremony symbolizes man's realization of his obligations to less evolved forms of\ncreation, instinctively tied to bodily identifications which also corrode human life, but lacking in that quality\nof liberating reason which is peculiar to humanity. BHUTA YAJNA thus reinforces man's readiness to succor\nthe weak, as he in turn is comforted by countless solicitudes of higher unseen beings. Man is also under bond\nfor rejuvenating gifts of nature, prodigal in earth, sea, and sky. The evolutionary barrier of incommunicability\namong nature, animals, man, and astral angels is thus overcome by offices of silent love.\nThe other two daily YAJNAS are PITRI and NRI. PITRI YAJNA is an offering of oblations to ancestors, as a\nsymbol of man's acknowledgment of his debt to the past, essence of whose wisdom illumines humanity today.\nNRI YAJNA is an offering of food to strangers or the poor, symbol of the present responsibilities of man, his\nduties to contemporaries.\nIn the early afternoon I fulfilled a neighborly NRI YAJNA by a visit to Gandhi's ashram for little girls. Mr.\nWright accompanied me on the ten−minute drive. Tiny young flowerlike faces atop the long−stemmed\ncolorful SARIS! At the end of a brief talk in Hindi {FN44−7} which I was giving outdoors, the skies unloosed\na sudden downpour. Laughing, Mr. Wright and I climbed aboard the car and sped back to MAGANVADI\namidst sheets of driving silver. Such tropical intensity and splash!\nReentering the guest house I was struck anew by the stark simplicity and evidences of self−sacrifice which are\neverywhere present. The Gandhi vow of non−possession came early in his married life. Renouncing an\nextensive legal practice which had been yielding him an annual income of more than $20,000, the Mahatma\ndispersed all his wealth to the poor.\nSri Yukteswar used to poke gentle fun at the commonly inadequate conceptions of renunciation.\n“A beggar cannot renounce wealth,” Master would say. “If a man laments: 'My business has failed; my wife\nhas left me; I will renounce all and enter a monastery,' to what worldly sacrifice is he referring? He did not\nrenounce wealth and love; they renounced him!”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 44. WITH MAHATMA GANDHI AT WARDHA\n252\n"}

Married in early youth, Gandhi and his wife took the vow of celibacy\nafter the birth of several sons. {FN44−8} A tranquil heroine in the intense drama that has been their life\ntogether, Kasturabai has followed her husband to prison, shared his three−week fasts, and fully borne her\nshare of his endless responsibilities. She has paid Gandhi the following tribute:\nI thank you for having had the privilege of being your lifelong companion and helpmate. I thank you for the\nmost perfect marriage in the world, based on BRAHMACHARYA (self−control) and not on sex. I thank you\nfor having considered me your equal in your life work for India. I thank you for not being one of those\nhusbands who spend their time in gambling, racing, women, wine, and song, tiring of their wives and children\nas the little boy quickly tires of his childhood toys. How thankful I am that you were not one of those\nhusbands who devote their time to growing rich on the exploitation of the labor of others.\nHow thankful I am that you put God and country before bribes, that you had the courage of your convictions\nand a complete and implicit faith in God. How thankful I am for a husband that put God and his country\nbefore me. I am grateful to you for your tolerance of me and my shortcomings of youth, when I grumbled and\nrebelled against the change you made in our mode of living, from so much to so little.\nAs a young child, I lived in your parents' home; your mother was a great and good woman; she trained me,\ntaught me how to be a brave, courageous wife and how to keep the love and respect of her son, my future\nhusband. As the years passed and you became India's most beloved leader, I had none of the fears that beset\nthe wife who may be cast aside when her husband has climbed the ladder of success, as so often happens in\nother countries. I knew that death would still find us husband and wife.\nFor years Kasturabai performed the duties of treasurer of the public funds which the idolized Mahatma is able\nto raise by the millions. There are many humorous stories in Indian homes to the effect that husbands are\nnervous about their wives' wearing any jewelry to a Gandhi meeting; the Mahatma's magical tongue, pleading\nfor the downtrodden, charms the gold bracelets and diamond necklaces right off the arms and necks of the\nwealthy into the collection basket!\nOne day the public treasurer, Kasturabai, could not account for a disbursement of four rupees. Gandhi duly\npublished an auditing in which he inexorably pointed out his wife's four rupee discrepancy.\nI had often told this story before classes of my American students. One evening a woman in the hall had given\nan outraged gasp.\n“Mahatma or no Mahatma,” she had cried, “if he were my husband I would have given him a black eye for\nsuch an unnecessary public insult!”\nAfter some good−humored banter had passed between us on the subject of American wives and Hindu wives,\nI had gone on to a fuller explanation.\n“Mrs. Gandhi considers the Mahatma not as her husband but as her guru, one who has the right to discipline\nher for even insignificant errors,” I had pointed out. “Sometime after Kasturabai had been publicly rebuked,\nGandhi was sentenced to prison on a political charge. As he was calmly bidding farewell to his wife, she fell\nat his feet. 'Master,' she said humbly, 'if I have ever offended you, please forgive me.'“ {FN44−9}\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 44.

Gandhi looked\nup with his unforgettable smile.\n“Mahatmaji,” I said as I squatted beside him on the uncushioned mat, “please tell me your definition of\nAHIMSA.”\n“The avoidance of harm to any living creature in thought or deed.”\n“Beautiful ideal! But the world will always ask: May one not kill a cobra to protect a child, or one's self?”\n“I could not kill a cobra without violating two of my vows—fearlessness, and non−killing. I would rather try\ninwardly to calm the snake by vibrations of love. I cannot possibly lower my standards to suit my\ncircumstances.” With his amazing candor, Gandhi added, “I must confess that I could not carry on this\nconversation were I faced by a cobra!”\nI remarked on several very recent Western books on diet which lay on his desk.\n“Yes, diet is important in the SATYAGRAHA movement−as everywhere else,” he said with a chuckle.\n“Because I advocate complete continence for SATYAGRAHIS, I am always trying to find out the best diet for\nthe celibate. One must conquer the palate before he can control the procreative instinct. Semi−starvation or\nunbalanced diets are not the answer. After overcoming the inward GREED for food, a SATYAGRAHI must\ncontinue to follow a rational vegetarian diet with all necessary vitamins, minerals, calories, and so forth. By\ninward and outward wisdom in regard to eating, the SATYAGRAHI'S sexual fluid is easily turned into vital\nenergy for the whole body.”\nThe Mahatma and I compared our knowledge of good meat−substitutes. “The avocado is excellent,” I said.\n“There are numerous avocado groves near my center in California.”\nGandhi's face lit with interest. “I wonder if they would grow in Wardha? The SATYAGRAHIS would\nappreciate a new food.”\n“I will be sure to send some avocado plants from Los Angeles to Wardha.” {FN44−10} I added, “Eggs are a\nhigh−protein food; are they forbidden to SATYAGRAHIS?”\n“Not unfertilized eggs.” The Mahatma laughed reminiscently. “For years I would not countenance their use;\neven now I personally do not eat them. One of my daughters−in−law was once dying of malnutrition; her\ndoctor insisted on eggs. I would not agree, and advised him to give her some egg−substitute.\n“'Gandhiji,' the doctor said, 'unfertilized eggs contain no life sperm; no killing is involved.'\n“I then gladly gave permission for my daughter−in−law to eat eggs; she was soon restored to health.”\nOn the previous night Gandhi had expressed a wish to receive the KRIYA YOGA of Lahiri Mahasaya. I was\ntouched by the Mahatma's open−mindedness and spirit of inquiry. He is childlike in his divine quest,\nrevealing that pure receptivity which Jesus praised in children, ”. . . of such is the kingdom of heaven.”\nThe hour for my promised instruction had arrived; several SATYAGRAHIS now entered the room−Mr.\nDesai, Dr. Pingale, and a few others who desired the KRIYA technique.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 44.

The body is visualized as divided into twenty\nparts; the will directs energy in turn to each section. Soon everyone was vibrating before me like a human\nmotor. It was easy to observe the rippling effect on Gandhi's twenty body parts, at all times completely\nexposed to view! Though very thin, he is not unpleasingly so; the skin of his body is smooth and unwrinkled.\nLater I initiated the group into the liberating technique of KRIYA YOGA.\nThe Mahatma has reverently studied all world religions. The Jain scriptures, the Biblical New Testament, and\nthe sociological writings of Tolstoy {FN44−11} are the three main sources of Gandhi's nonviolent\nconvictions. He has stated his credo thus:\nI believe the Bible, the KORAN, and the ZEND−AVESTA {FN44−12} to be as divinely inspired as the\nVEDAS. I believe in the institution of Gurus, but in this age millions must go without a Guru, because it is a\nrare thing to find a combination of perfect purity and perfect learning. But one need not despair of ever\nknowing the truth of one's religion, because the fundamentals of Hinduism as of every great religion are\nunchangeable, and easily understood.\nI believe like every Hindu in God and His oneness, in rebirth and salvation. . . . I can no more describe my\nfeeling for Hinduism than for my own wife. She moves me as no other woman in the world can. Not that she\nhas no faults; I daresay she has many more than I see myself. But the feeling of an indissoluble bond is there.\nEven so I feel for and about Hinduism with all its faults and limitations. Nothing delights me so much as the\nmusic of the GITA, or the RAMAYANA by Tulsidas. When I fancied I was taking my last breath, the GITA\nwas my solace.\nHinduism is not an exclusive religion. In it there is room for the worship of all the prophets of the world.\n{FN44−13} It is not a missionary religion in the ordinary sense of the term. It has no doubt absorbed many\ntribes in its fold, but this absorption has been of an evolutionary, imperceptible character. Hinduism tells each\nman to worship God according to his own faith or DHARMA, {FN44−14} and so lives at peace with all\nreligions.\nOf Christ, Gandhi has written: “I am sure that if He were living here now among men, He would bless the\nlives of many who perhaps have never even heard His name . . . just as it is written: 'Not every one that saith\nunto me, Lord, Lord . . . but he that doeth the will of my Father.' {FN44−15} In the lesson of His own life,\nJesus gave humanity the magnificent purpose and the single objective toward which we all ought to aspire. I\nbelieve that He belongs not solely to Christianity, but to the entire world, to all lands and races.”\nOn my last evening in Wardha I addressed the meeting which had been called by Mr. Desai in Town Hall. The\nroom was thronged to the window sills with about 400 people assembled to hear the talk on yoga. I spoke first\nin Hindi, then in English. Our little group returned to the ashram in time for a good−night glimpse of Gandhi,\nenfolded in peace and correspondence.\nNight was still lingering when I rose at 5:00 A.M. Village life was already stirring; first a bullock cart by the\nashram gates, then a peasant with his huge burden balanced precariously on his head. After breakfast our trio\nsought out Gandhi for farewell PRONAMS. The saint rises at four o'clock for his morning prayer.\n“Mahatmaji, good−by!” I knelt to touch his feet. “India is safe in your keeping!”\nYears have rolled by since the Wardha idyl; the earth, oceans, and skies have darkened with a world at war.\nAlone among great leaders, Gandhi has offered a practical nonviolent alternative to armed might. To redress\ngrievances and remove injustices, the Mahatma has employed nonviolent means which again and again have\nproved their effectiveness. He states his doctrine in these words:\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 44. WITH MAHATMA GANDHI AT WARDHA\n255\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (281p).pdf", "page": 259, "text": "I have found that life persists in the midst of destruction. Therefore there must be a higher law than that of\ndestruction. Only under that law would well−ordered society be intelligible and life worth living.\nIf that is the law of life we must work it out in daily existence. Wherever there are wars, wherever we are\nconfronted with an opponent, conquer by love. I have found that the certain law of love has answered in my\nown life as the law of destruction has never done.\nIn India we have had an ocular demonstration of the operation of this law on the widest scale possible. I don't\nclaim that nonviolence has penetrated the 360,000,000 people in India, but I do claim it has penetrated deeper\nthan any other doctrine in an incredibly short time.\nIt takes a fairly strenuous course of training to attain a mental state of nonviolence. It is a disciplined life, like\nthe life of a soldier. The perfect state is reached only when the mind, body, and speech are in proper\ncoordination. Every problem would lend itself to solution if we determined to make the law of truth and\nnonviolence the law of life.\nJust as a scientist will work wonders out of various applications of the laws of nature, a man who applies the\nlaws of love with scientific precision can work greater wonders. Nonviolence is infinitely more wonderful and\nsubtle than forces of nature like, for instance, electricity. The law of love is a far greater science than any\nmodern science.\nConsulting history, one may reasonably state that the problems of mankind have not been solved by the use of\nbrute force. World War I produced a world−chilling snowball of war karma that swelled into World War II.\nOnly the warmth of brotherhood can melt the present colossal snowball of war karma which may otherwise\ngrow into World War III. This unholy trinity will banish forever the possibility of World War IV by a finality\nof atomic bombs. Use of jungle logic instead of human reason in settling disputes will restore the earth to a\njungle. If brothers not in life, then brothers in violent death.\nWar and crime never pay. The billions of dollars that went up in the smoke of explosive nothingness would\nhave been sufficient to have made a new world, one almost free from disease and completely free from\npoverty. Not an earth of fear, chaos, famine, pestilence, the DANSE MACABRE, but one broad land of peace,\nof prosperity, and of widening knowledge.\nThe nonviolent voice of Gandhi appeals to man's highest conscience. Let nations ally themselves no longer\nwith death, but with life; not with destruction, but with construction; not with the Annihilator, but with the\nCreator.\n“One should forgive, under any injury,” says the MAHABHARATA. “It hath been said that the continuation\nof species is due to man's being forgiving. Forgiveness is holiness; by forgiveness the universe is held\ntogether. Forgiveness is the might of the mighty; forgiveness is sacrifice; forgiveness is quiet of mind.\nForgiveness and gentleness are the qualities of the self−possessed. They represent eternal virtue.”\nNonviolence is the natural outgrowth of the law of forgiveness and love. “If loss of life becomes necessary in\na righteous battle,” Gandhi proclaims, “one should be prepared, like Jesus, to shed his own, not others', blood.\nEventually there will be less blood spilt in the world.”\nEpics shall someday be written on the Indian SATYAGRAHIS who withstood hate with love, violence with\nnonviolence, who allowed themselves to be mercilessly slaughtered rather than retaliate. The result on certain\nhistoric occasions was that the armed opponents threw down their guns and fled, shamed, shaken to their\ndepths by the sight of men who valued the life of another above their own.\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 44.

It includes in its sweep all the\nnations of the earth. {FN44−17} My nationalism includes the well−being of the whole world. I do not want\nmy India to rise on the ashes of other nations. I do not want India to exploit a single human being. I want India\nto be strong in order that she can infect the other nations also with her strength. Not so with a single nation in\nEurope today; they do not give strength to the others.\nPresident Wilson mentioned his beautiful fourteen points, but said: “After all, if this endeavor of ours to arrive\nat peace fails, we have our armaments to fall back upon.” I want to reverse that position, and I say: “Our\narmaments have failed already. Let us now be in search of something new; let us try the force of love and God\nwhich is truth.” When we have got that, we shall want nothing else.\nBy the Mahatma's training of thousands of true SATYAGRAHIS (those who have taken the eleven rigorous\nvows mentioned in the first part of this chapter), who in turn spread the message; by patiently educating the\nIndian masses to understand the spiritual and eventually material benefits of nonviolence; by arming his\npeople with nonviolent weapons—non−cooperation with injustice, the willingness to endure indignities,\nprison, death itself rather than resort to arms; by enlisting world sympathy through countless examples of\nheroic martyrdom among SATYAGRAHIS, Gandhi has dramatically portrayed the practical nature of\nnonviolence, its solemn power to settle disputes without war.\nGandhi has already won through nonviolent means a greater number of political concessions for his land than\nhave ever been won by any leader of any country except through bullets. Nonviolent methods for eradication\nof all wrongs and evils have been strikingly applied not only in the political arena but in the delicate and\ncomplicated field of Indian social reform. Gandhi and his followers have removed many longstanding feuds\nbetween Hindus and Mohammedans; hundreds of thousands of Moslems look to the Mahatma as their leader.\nThe untouchables have found in him their fearless and triumphant champion. “If there be a rebirth in store for\nme,” Gandhi wrote, “I wish to be born a pariah in the midst of pariahs, because thereby I would be able to\nrender them more effective service.”\nThe Mahatma is indeed a “great soul,” but it was illiterate millions who had the discernment to bestow the\ntitle. This gentle prophet is honored in his own land. The lowly peasant has been able to rise to Gandhi's high\nchallenge. The Mahatma wholeheartedly believes in the inherent nobility of man. The inevitable failures have\nnever disillusioned him. “Even if the opponent plays him false twenty times,” he writes, “the SATYAGRAHI\nis ready to trust him the twenty−first time, for an implicit trust in human nature is the very essence of the\ncreed.” {FN44−18}\n“Mahatmaji, you are an exceptional man. You must not expect the world to act as you do.” A critic once made\nthis observation.\n“It is curious how we delude ourselves, fancying that the body can be improved, but that it is impossible to\nevoke the hidden powers of the soul,” Gandhi replied. “I am engaged in trying to show that if I have any of\nthose powers, I am as frail a mortal as any of us and that I never had anything extraordinary about me nor\nhave I now. I am a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have\nenough humility to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. I own that I have an immovable faith in God\nand His goodness, and an unconsumable passion for truth and love. But is that not what every person has\nlatent in him? If we are to make progress, we must not repeat history but make new history. We must add to\nthe inheritance left by our ancestors. If we may make new discoveries and inventions in the phenomenal\nworld, must we declare our bankruptcy in the spiritual domain?

Must man always be brute first and man after, if at all?” {FN44−19}\nAmericans may well remember with pride the successful nonviolent experiment of William Penn in founding\nhis 17th century colony in Pennsylvania. There were “no forts, no soldiers, no militia, even no arms.” Amidst\nthe savage frontier wars and the butcheries that went on between the new settlers and the Red Indians, the\nQuakers of Pennsylvania alone remained unmolested. “Others were slain; others were massacred; but they\nwere safe. Not a Quaker woman suffered assault; not a Quaker child was slain, not a Quaker man was\ntortured.” When the Quakers were finally forced to give up the government of the state, “war broke out, and\nsome Pennsylvanians were killed. But only three Quakers were killed, three who had so far fallen from their\nfaith as to carry weapons of defence.”\n“Resort to force in the Great War (I) failed to bring tranquillity,” Franklin D.

That lesson the world should have learned.”\n“The more weapons of violence, the more misery to mankind,” Lao−tzu taught. “The triumph of violence\nends in a festival of mourning.”\n“I am fighting for nothing less than world peace,” Gandhi has declared. “If the Indian movement is carried to\nsuccess on a nonviolent SATYAGRAHA basis, it will give a new meaning to patriotism and, if I may say so\nin all humility, to life itself.”\nBefore the West dismisses Gandhi's program as one of an impractical dreamer, let it first reflect on a\ndefinition of SATYAGRAHA by the Master of Galilee:\n“Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: but I say unto you, That ye\nresist not evil: {FN44−20} but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.”\nGandhi's epoch has extended, with the beautiful precision of cosmic timing, into a century already desolated\nand devastated by two World Wars.

Miss Slade, the Mahatma's SATYAGRAHA disciple for twenty years,\nissued a signed statement to the UNITED PRESS, dated Dec. 29, 1945, in which she explained that a series of\nbaseless rumors arose after she had departed, with Gandhi's blessings, for a small site in northeastern India\nnear the Himalayas, for the purpose of founding there her now−flourishing KISAN ASHRAM (center for\nmedical and agricultural aid to peasant farmers). Mahatma Gandhi plans to visit the new ashram during 1946.\n{FN44−4} Miss Slade reminded me of another distinguished Western woman, Miss Margaret Woodrow\nWilson, eldest daughter of America's great president. I met her in New York; she was intensely interested in\nIndia. Later she went to Pondicherry, where she spent the last five years of her life, happily pursuing a path of\ndiscipline at the feet of Sri Aurobindo Ghosh.

An Indo−Aryan language based largely on\nSanskrit roots, Hindi is the chief vernacular of northern India. The main dialect of Western Hindi is\nHindustani, written both in the DEVANAGARI (Sanskrit) characters and in Arabic characters. Its subdialect,\nUrdu, is spoken by Moslems.\n{FN44−8} Gandhi has described his life with a devastating candor in THE STORY OF MY EXPERIMENTS\nWITH TRUTH (Ahmedabad: Navajivan Press, 1927−29, 2 vol.) This autobiography has been summarized in\nMAHATMA GANDHI, HIS OWN STORY, edited by C. F. Andrews, with an introduction by John Haynes\nHolmes (New York: Macmillan Co., 1930).\nMany autobiographies replete with famous names and colorful events are almost completely silent on any\nphase of inner analysis or development. One lays down each of these books with a certain dissatisfaction, as\nthough saying: “Here is a man who knew many notable persons, but who never knew himself.” This reaction\nis impossible with Gandhi's autobiography; he exposes his faults and subterfuges with an impersonal devotion\nto truth rare in annals of any age.\n{FN44−9} Kasturabai Gandhi died in imprisonment at Poona on February 22, 1944. The usually unemotional\nGandhi wept silently. Shortly after her admirers had suggested a Memorial Fund in her honor, 125 lacs of\nrupees (nearly four million dollars) poured in from all over India. Gandhi has arranged that the fund be used\nfor village welfare work among women and children.

She was evidently on the point of departure. Mr. Wright parked the Ford some distance away, and\naccompanied me on foot toward the quiet assemblage. The woman saint glanced in our direction; she alit from\nher car and walked toward us.\n“Father, you have come!” With these fervent words she put her arm around my neck and her head on my\nshoulder. Mr. Wright, to whom I had just remarked that I did not know the saint, was hugely enjoying this\nextraordinary demonstration of welcome. The eyes of the one hundred chelas were also fixed with some\nsurprise on the affectionate tableau.\nI had instantly seen that the saint was in a high state of SAMADHI. Utterly oblivious to her outward garb as a\nwoman, she knew herself as the changeless soul; from that plane she was joyously greeting another devotee of\nGod. She led me by the hand into her automobile.\n“Ananda Moyi Ma, I am delaying your journey!” I protested.\n“Father, I am meeting you for the first time in this life, after ages!” she said. “Please do not leave yet.”\nWe sat together in the rear seats of the car. The Blissful Mother soon entered the immobile ecstatic state. Her\nbeautiful eyes glanced heavenward and, half−opened, became stilled, gazing into the near−far inner Elysium.\nThe disciples chanted gently: “Victory to Mother Divine!”\nI had found many men of God−realization in India, but never before had I met such an exalted woman saint.\nHer gentle face was burnished with the ineffable joy that had given her the name of Blissful Mother. Long\nblack tresses lay loosely behind her unveiled head. A red dot of sandalwood paste on her forehead symbolized\nthe spiritual eye, ever open within her. Tiny face, tiny hands, tiny feet−a contrast to her spiritual magnitude!\nI put some questions to a near−by woman chela while Ananda Moyi Ma remained entranced.\n“The Blissful Mother travels widely in India; in many parts she has hundreds of disciples,” the chela told me.\n“Her courageous efforts have brought about many desirable social reforms. Although a Brahmin, the saint\nrecognizes no caste distinctions. {FN45−1} A group of us always travel with her, looking after her comforts.\nWe have to mother her; she takes no notice of her body. If no one gave her food, she would not eat, or make\nany inquiries. Even when meals are placed before her, she does not touch them. To prevent her disappearance\nfrom this world, we disciples feed her with our own hands. For days together she often stays in the divine\ntrance, scarcely breathing, her eyes unwinking. One of her chief disciples is her husband. Many years ago,\nsoon after their marriage, he took the vow of silence.”\nThe chela pointed to a broad−shouldered, fine−featured man with long hair and hoary beard. He was standing\nquietly in the midst of the gathering, his hands folded in a disciple's reverential attitude.\nRefreshed by her dip in the Infinite, Ananda Moyi Ma was now focusing her consciousness on the material\nworld.\n“Father, please tell me where you stay.” Her voice was clear and melodious.\n“At present, in Calcutta or Ranchi; but soon I shall be returning to America.”\n“America?”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 45.

Wherever she goes, we must go.”\nReluctantly I abandoned the plan, as possessing an impractical feature of spontaneous enlargement!\n“Please come at least to Ranchi, with your disciples,” I said on taking leave of the saint. “As a divine child\nyourself, you will enjoy the little ones in my school.”\n“Whenever Father takes me, I will gladly go.”\nA short time later the Ranchi VIDYALAYA was in gala array for the saint's promised visit. The youngsters\nlooked forward to any day of festivity−no lessons, hours of music, and a feast for the climax!\n“Victory! Ananda Moyi Ma, ki jai!” This reiterated chant from scores of enthusiastic little throats greeted the\nsaint's party as it entered the school gates. Showers of marigolds, tinkle of cymbals, lusty blowing of conch\nshells and beat of the MRIDANGA drum! The Blissful Mother wandered smilingly over the sunny\nVIDYALAYA grounds, ever carrying within her the portable paradise.\n“It is beautiful here,” Ananda Moyi Ma said graciously as I led her into the main building. She seated herself\nwith a childlike smile by my side. The closest of dear friends, she made one feel, yet an aura of remoteness\nwas ever around her−the paradoxical isolation of Omnipresence.\n“Please tell me something of your life.”\n“Father knows all about it; why repeat it?” She evidently felt that the factual history of one short incarnation\nwas beneath notice.\nI laughed, gently repeating my question.\n“Father, there is little to tell.” She spread her graceful hands in a deprecatory gesture. “My consciousness has\nnever associated itself with this temporary body.

Her form was statue−still; she had fled to her ever−calling\nkingdom. The dark pools of her eyes appeared lifeless and glassy. This expression is often present when saints\nremove their consciousness from the physical body, which is then hardly more than a piece of soulless clay.\nWe sat together for an hour in the ecstatic trance. She returned to this world with a gay little laugh.\n“Please, Ananda Moyi Ma,” I said, “come with me to the garden. Mr. Wright will take some pictures.”\n“Of course, Father. Your will is my will.” Her glorious eyes retained the unchanging divine luster as she\nposed for many photographs.\nTime for the feast! Ananda Moyi Ma squatted on her blanket−seat, a disciple at her elbow to feed her. Like an\ninfant, the saint obediently swallowed the food after the chela had brought it to her lips.

Not by the\nhairsplitting distinctions of scholars but by the sure logic of faith, the childlike saint has solved the only\nproblem in human life−establishment of unity with God. Man has forgotten this stark simplicity, now\nbefogged by a million issues.

Within me I still hear her voice, an echo of measureless\nsweetness:\n“Behold, now and always one with the Eternal, 'I am ever the same.'“\n{FN45−1} I find some further facts of Ananda Moyi Ma's life, printed in EAST−WEST.

My interest finally mounted so high\nthat I approached the Maharaja of Burdwan {FN46−2} and asked him to conduct an investigation. Astounded\nat the story, he invited her to his palace. She agreed to a test and lived for two months locked up in a small\nsection of his home. Later she returned for a palace visit of twenty days; and then for a third test of fifteen\ndays.

What a sensation we\ncreated−a group piloted by an American and pioneering in a snorting car right into their hamlet fastness,\ninvading the ancient privacy and sanctity!\n“Halting by a narrow lane we found ourselves within a hundred feet of Giri Bala's ancestral home.

Finally we had recorded for posterity many photographs of the only woman in the world who is\nknown to have lived without food or drink for over fifty years.

Most motherly was Giri Bala's expression as she stood before us, completely covered in the\nloose−flowing cloth, nothing of her body visible but her face with its downcast eyes, her hands, and her tiny\nfeet. A face of rare peace and innocent poise−a wide, childlike, quivering lip, a feminine nose, narrow,\nsparkling eyes, and a wistful smile.”\nMr. Wright's impression of Giri Bala was shared by myself; spirituality enfolded her like her gently shining\nveil.

Soon I was dividing every fortnight between\nLos Angeles and Encinitas. Sunday services, classes, lectures before clubs and colleges, interviews with\nstudents, ceaseless streams of correspondence, articles for EAST−WEST, direction of activities in India and\nnumerous small centers in American cities. Much time was given, also, to the arrangement of KRIYA and\nother Self−Realization Fellowship teachings into a series of studies for the distant yoga seekers whose zeal\nrecognized no limitation of space.\nJoyous dedication of a Self−Realization Church of All Religions took place in 1938 at Washington, D.C. Set\namidst landscaped grounds, the stately church stands in a section of the city aptly called “Friendship Heights.”\nThe Washington leader is Swami Premananda, educated at the Ranchi school and Calcutta University. I had\nsummoned him in 1928 to assume leadership of the Washington Self−Realization Fellowship center.\n“Premananda,” I told him during a visit to his new temple, “this Eastern headquarters is a memorial in stone to\nyour tireless devotion.

I understood his\nlaconic question: “Have you been happy in America? What about the disillusionments, the heartaches, the\ncenter leaders who could not lead, the students who could not be taught?”\n“Blessed is the man whom the Lord doth test, Doctor! He has remembered now and then to put a burden on\nme!” I thought, then, of all the faithful ones, of the love and devotion and understanding that lay in the heart\nof America. With slow emphasis I went on, “But my answer is: Yes, a thousand times yes! It has been\nworth−while; it has been a constant inspiration, more than ever I dreamed, to see West and East brought\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 48. AT ENCINITAS IN CALIFORNIA\n276\n"}

Soon we were strolling in the sunshine. My companion pointed to new towers in process\nof construction along the edge of the Fellowship property adjoining the coast highway.\n“Sir, I see many improvements here since my last visit.” Dr. Lewis comes twice annually from Boston to\nEncinitas.\n“Yes, Doctor, a project I have long considered is beginning to take definite form. In these beautiful\nsurroundings I have started a miniature world colony. Brotherhood is an ideal better understood by example\nthan precept! A small harmonious group here may inspire other ideal communities over the earth.”\n“A splendid idea, sir! The colony will surely be a success if everyone sincerely does his part!”\n“'World' is a large term, but man must enlarge his allegiance, considering himself in the light of a world\ncitizen,” I continued. “A person who truly feels: 'The world is my homeland; it is my America, my India, my\nPhilippines, my England, my Africa,' will never lack scope for a useful and happy life. His natural local pride\nwill know limitless expansion; he will be in touch with creative universal currents.”\nDr. Lewis and I halted above the lotus pool near the hermitage. Below us lay the illimitable Pacific.\n“These same waters break equally on the coasts of West and East, in California and China.” My companion\nthrew a little stone into the first of the oceanic seventy million square miles. “Encinitas is a symbolic spot for\na world colony.”\n“That is true, Doctor. We shall arrange here for many conferences and Congresses of Religion, inviting\ndelegates from all lands. Flags of the nations will hang in our halls. Diminutive temples will be built over the\ngrounds, dedicated to the world's principal religions.\n“As soon as possible,” I went on, “I plan to open a Yoga Institute here. The blessed role of KRIYA YOGA in\nthe West has hardly more than just begun. May all men come to know that there is a definite, scientific\ntechnique of self−realization for the overcoming of all human misery!”\nAutobiography of a Yogi\nCHAPTER 48.

Utopia must spring in the private bosom before it can\nflower in civic virtue. Man is a soul, not an institution; his inner reforms alone can lend permanence to outer\nones.
