Many of the \nreligious and philosophical concepts and methods he introduced \ndecades ago are now finding expression in education, psychology, \nbusiness, medicine, and other spheres of endeavour—contributing in \nfar-reaching ways to a more integrated, humane, and spiritual vision \nof human life. \nThe fact that Paramahansa Yoganandaji's teachings are being inter-\npreted and creatively applied in many different fields, as well as by \nexponents of diverse philosophical and metaphysical movements, \npoints not only to the great practical utility of what he taught, but \nalso to makes clear the need for some means of ensuring that the spir-\nitual legacy he left not be diluted, fragmented, or distorted with the \npassing of time. \nWith the increasing variety of sources of information about \nParamahansa Yogananda, readers sometimes inquire how they can be \ncertain that a publication accurately presents his life and teachings. In \nresponse to these inquiries, we would like to explain \nthat \nParamahansaji founded Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-\nRealization Fellowship to disseminate his teachings and to preserve \ntheir purity and integrity for future generations. He personally chose \nand trained those close disciples who head the Yogoda Satsanga \nSociety/Self-Realization Fellowship Publications Council, and gave \nthem specific guidelines for the preparation and publishing of his lec-\ntures, writings, and Yogoda Satsanga Lessons. The members of the \nYSS/SRF Publications Council honour these guidelines as a sacred \ntrust, in order that the universal message of this beloved world teacher \nmay live on in its original power and authenticity. \nThe Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-Realization Fellowship \nname and the SRF emblem (shown above) were originated by \nParamahansaji to identify the organization he founded to carry on his \nworldwide spiritual and humanitarian work. These appear on all YSS \nbooks, audio and video recordings, films, and other publications, \nassuring the reader that the work originates with the organization \nfounded by Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda and faithfully conveys his \nteachings as he himself intended they be given. \nYOGODA SATSANGA SOCIETY OF INDIA/ \nSELF-REALIZATION FELLOWSHIP \n"}

As I stood at the back of the crowded audi-\ntorium, I became transfixed, unaware of anything around me ex-\ncept the speaker and his words. My whole being was absorbed \nin the wisdom and divine love that were pouring into my soul \nand flooding my heart and mind. I could only think, \"This man \nloves God as I have always longed to love Him. He knows God. \nHim I shall follow.\" And from that moment, I did. \nAs I felt the transfiguring power of his words on my own life \nduring those early days with Paramahansaji, there arose within \nme a feeling of the urgent need to preserve his words for all the \nworld, for all time. It became my sacred and joyous privilege, \nduring the many years I was with Paramahansa Yogananda, to \nrecord his lectures and classes, and also many informal talks and \nwords of personal counsel—truly a vast treasurehouse of won-\ndrous wisdom and God-love. As Gurudeva spoke, the rush of his \ninspiration was often reflected in the swiftness of his speech; he \nmight speak without pause for minutes at a time, and continue \nfor an hour. While his hearers sat enthralled, my pen was flying! \nAs I took down his words in shorthand, it was as though a spe-\ncial grace had descended, instantly translating the Guru's voice \ninto the shorthand characters on the page. Their transcription \nhas been a blessed task that continues to this day.

It is thus a book about God's love for each soul created \nby Him, and how we as incarnate souls can experience God's \nloving presence in our lives. \nThe author's message holds universal appeal, for what hu-\nman being has never yearned for perfect love—a love that does \nnot fade with time, old age, or death? Certainly everyone has \nlonged to experience the lasting satisfaction and perfection of \nsuch a relationship, but the question has always been, \"Is it re-\nally possible?\" Paramahansa Yogananda boldly declares that it \nis possible. Through the example of his life and teaching, he \nproves that the inner fulfilment and love we seek does exist \nand can be attained—in God. \"The greatest love you can ex-\nperience is in communion with God,\" he states, in the open-\ning lecture of The Divine Romance. \n\"The love between the \nsoul and Spirit is the perfect love, the love you are all seeking.\" \nParamahansaji does not speak from mere theory or theology; \nhis words flow from experience of the love and wisdom of God, \nproviding an inspirational and pragmatic approach, that \"those \nwho have ears to hear\" may also discover this all-fulfilling Divine \nPresence in their own lives. His wisdom is not the studied learn-\ning of a scholar; it is the empirical testimony of a dynamic spiri-\ntual personage whose life was filled with inner joy and outer ac-\ncomplishment, a world teacher who lived what he taught, a \nPiemavatai (incarnation of love) whose sole desire was to share \nGod's wisdom and love with all. \nParamahansa Yogananda was born in Gorakhpur, Uttar \nxxi \n"}

He had a remarkable childhood \nthat clearly indicated his life was marked for a divine destiny. \nHis mother recognized this and encouraged his noble ideals and \nspiritual aspirations. When he was only eleven, the loss of his \nmother, whom he loved above all else in this world, made firm \nhis inherent resolve to find God and to receive from the Cre-\nator Himself the divine love yearned for in every human heart. \nYoganandaji soon became a disciple of one of a line of exalted \ngurus with whom he had been linked from birth: the great Jnana-\nvatar (incarnation of wisdom) Sri Sri Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri. \nSri Yogananda's parents were disciples of Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasaya, \nguru of Sri Yukteswar. When Paramahansaji was an infant in his \nmother's arms, Lahiri Mahasaya had blessed him and foretold: \n\"Little mother, thy son will be a yogi. As a spiritual engine, he \nwill carry many souls to God's kingdom.\" Lahiri Mahasaya was \na disciple of Sri Sri Mahavatar Babaji, the deathless master who \nrevived in this age the ancient science of Kriya Yoga. Praised by \nBhagavan Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, and by Patanjali in the \nYoga Sutias, Kriya Yoga is both a transcendent technique of med-\nitation and an art of living that leads to union of the soul with \nGod. Mahavatar Babaji revealed the sacred Kriya to Lahiri Ma-\nhasaya, who handed it down to Sri Yukteswar, who taught it to \nParamahansa Yogananda. \nWhen in 1920 Paramahansa Yogananda was deemed ready \nto begin his world mission of disseminating the soul-liberating \nscience of Yoga, Mahavatar Babaji told him of the sacred re-\nsponsibility that was to be his: \"You are the one I have chosen \nto spread the message of Kriya Yoga in the West. Long ago I met \nyour guru Yukteswar at a Kumbha Mela; I told him then I would \nsend you to him for training. Kriya Yoga, the scientific technique \nof God-realization, will ultimately spread in all lands, and aid in \nharmonizing the nations through man's personal, transcenden-\ntal perception of the Infinite Father.\" \nParamahansa Yogananda began his mission in America as a \ndelegate to the International Congress of Religious Liberals in \nBoston in 1920. For more than a decade he travelled the length \nand breadth of America, speaking almost daily to capacity audi-\nences in all the major cities.

From the international headquarters, the Guru's \nteachings are spread worldwide, including his many books and \nthe printed Self-Realization [Yogoda Satsanga] Lessons on the \nscience of Kriya Yoga meditation and the art of spiritual living. \nSeekers in India and surrounding territories receive these publi-\ncations from Yogoda Satsanga Society of India. The Guru's work \nis guided and served monks and nuns of Yogoda Satsanga Soci-\nety of India/Self-Realization Fellowship, to whom Paramahansaji \nentrusted the responsibility of carrying on his work and pre-\nserving the purity of his teachings. \nIn the late 1930s Paramahansaji began to withdraw gradu-\nally from nationwide public lecturing. \"I am not interested in \ncrowds,\" he said, \"but in souls who are in earnest to know God.\" \nThereafter, he concentrated his efforts on talks and classes for \nthose who were deeply interested in seeking God; he spoke \nmostly at his own Self-Realization Fellowship temples and the \ninternational headquarters. \nParamahansa Yogananda had often voiced this prediction: \n\"I will not die in bed, but with my boots on, speaking of God \nand India.\" On March 7, 1952, the prophecy was fulfilled. At a \nbanquet in honour of the Ambassador of India, B. R. Sen, Para-\nmahansaji was a guest speaker. He delivered a soul-stirring ad-\ndress, concluding with these words from a poem he had writ-\nten, \"My India\": \"Where Ganges, woods, Himalayan caves and \nmen dream God—I am hallowed; my body touched that sod!\" \nHe then lifted his eyes upward and entered mahasamadhi, \nan \nadvanced yogi's conscious exit from the physical body.

On that day \nIndia issued a commemorative stamp in his honour, paying trib-\nute to the Guru in these words: \"The ideal of love for God and \nservice to humanity found full expression in the life of Parama-\nhansa Yogananda... .Though the major part of his life was spent \noutside India, still he takes his place among our great saints. His \nwork continues to grow and shine ever more brightly, drawing \npeople everywhere on the path of the pilgrimage of the Spirit.\" \nTo those who were personally associated with Paramahan-\nsaji, it was apparent that his greatness lay not only in the pro-\nfound wisdom of his teachings, but also in the deep love and \ncompassionate understanding that emanated from his being. An \ninexpressible sweetness informed his every word, glance, and \ngesture, and one knew beyond doubt that his love was without \nlimit or condition. It was plain that in his eyes one's weak-\nnesses and failings did not matter, that he saw in every soul \nonly the pure reflection of God. \nAlthough we are now prevented by time and space from be-\ning personally present at one of Paramahansa Yogananda's talks, \nwe can receive-the blessing of reading and absorbing his words, \nand for this opportunity we can thank Sri Daya Mata, president \nof Self-Realization Fellowship.

Love has been so abused and crucified by man that \nvery few people know what true love is. Just as oil is present in \nevery part of the olive, so love permeates every part of creation. \nBut to define love is very difficult, for the same reason that words \ncannot fully describe the flavour of an orange. You have to taste \nthe fruit to know its flavour. So with love. All of you have tasted \nlove in some form in your hearts; therefore you know a little \nabout what it is. But you have not understood how to develop \nlove, how to purify and expand it into divine love. A spark of this \ndivine love exists in most hearts in the beginning of life, but is \nusually lost, because man does not know how to cultivate it. \nMany people wouldn't think it even necessary to analyse \nwhat love is. They recognize love as the feeling they have for \ntheir relatives, friends, and others to whom they are strongly \nattracted. But there is much more to it than that. The only way \nI can describe real love to you is to tell you its effect. If you \ncould feel even a particle of divine love, so great would be your \njoy—so overpowering—you could not contain it. \nThink deeply about what I am telling you. The satisfaction \nof love is not in the feeling itself, but in the joy that feeling \nbrings. Love gives joy. We love love because it gives us such in-\ntoxicating happiness. So love is not the ultimate; the ultimate is \nbliss. God is Sat-Chit-Ananda, \never-existing, ever-conscious, \never-new Bliss.

Joy means exhilaration, an \nexpression of the ultimate Bliss. \nMan's experience of joy originates in the brain, in the sub-\ntle centre of God-consciousness that the yogis call the sahas-\niara, or thousand-petalled lotus. Yet the actual feeling of joy is \nexperienced not in the head but in the heart. From the divine \nseat of God-consciousness in the brain, joy descends into the \nheart centre, * and manifests there. That joy comes from God's \nbliss—the essential and ultimate attribute of Spirit. \nThough joy may be born in conjunction with certain outer \nconditions, it is not subject to conditions,- it often manifests \nwithout any material cause. Sometimes you wake up in the \nmorning \"walking on air\" with joy, and you don't know why. \nAnd when you sit in the silence of deep meditation, joy bub-\nbles up from within, roused by no outer stimulus. The joy of \nmeditation is overwhelming. Those who have not gone into \nthe silence of true meditation do not know what real joy is. \nWe feel much happiness in the satisfaction of a desire,- but \nin youth we often feel in the heart a sudden happiness that \ncomes as if from nowhere. Joy expresses itself under certain \nconditions, but it is not created by those conditions. Thus, \nwhen someone receives a thousand dollars and exclaims, \"Oh, \nhow happy I am!\" the condition of having received a thousand \ndollars has merely served as a pickaxe, releasing a fountain of \njoy from the hidden reservoir of bliss within. So, in human ex-\nperience, certain events are usually required to bring forth joy, \nbut the joy itself is the perennial native state of the soul.

Can you think of love without \njoy? No. Joy attends love. When we speak of the misery of un-\nrequited love, we are talking of an unfulfiled longing. The ac-\ntual experience of love is always accompanied by joy. \nThe Universal Nature of Love \nIn the universal sense, love is the divine power of attrac-\ntion in creation that harmonizes, unites, binds together. It is \nopposed by the force of repulsion, which is the outgoing cos-\nmic energy that materializes creation from the cosmic con-\nsciousness of God. Repulsion keeps all forms in the manifested \nstate through maya, the power of delusion that divides, differ-\nentiates, and disharmonizes. The attractive force of love coun-\nteracts cosmic repulsion to harmonize all creation and ulti-\nmately draw it back to God. Those who live in tune with the \nattractive force of love achieve harmony with nature and their \nfellow beings, and are attracted to blissful reunion with God. \nIn this world, love presupposes duality; it springs from a mu-\ntual exchange or suggestion of feeling between two or more \nforms. Even animals express a certain type of love for one another \nand for their offspring. In many species, when one mate dies, the \nother usually succumbs soon after. But this love in animals is in-\nstinctive; they are not responsible for their love. Human beings, \nhowever, have a great deal of conscious self-determination in \ntheir exchange of love with others. \nIn man, love expresses itself in various ways. We find love \nbetween man and wife, parent and child, brother and sister, \nfriend and friend, master and servant, guru and disciple—as \nwith Jesus and his disciples and the great masters of India and \ntheir chelas—and between the devotee and God, soul and Spirit. \nLove is a universal emotion,- its expressions are distinguished \nby the nature of the thought through which it moves. Hence, \nwhen love passes through the heart of the father, fatherly con-\nsciousness translates it into fatherly love. When it passes through \nthe heart of the mother, motherly consciousness translates it into \nmotherly love. When it passes through the heart of the lover, the \nconsciousness of the lover gives that universal love still another \nquality. It is not the physical instrument, but the consciousness \nthrough which the love moves that determines the quality of love \n"}

Thus a father may express motherly love, a mother \nmay express friendly love, a lover may express divine love. \nEvery reflection of love comes from the one Cosmic Love, \nbut when expressed as human love in its various forms, there \nis always some taint in it. The mother doesn't know why she \nloves the child; the child knows not why he loves the mother. \nThey do not know whence comes this love they feel for one an-\nother. It is the manifestation in them of God's love; and when \nit is pure and unselfish, it reflects His divine love. Thus, by in-\nvestigating human love, we can learn something of divine love, \nfor in human love we have glimpses of that love of God's. \nFatherly Love Is Based on Reason \nFatherly love is wisdom-born, and based on reason. Up-\npermost in the father's consciousness is the thought, \"This is \nmy child to take care of and protect.\" He does this unselfishly, \nexpressing his love by doing things to please and instruct the \nchild as well as providing for its needs. But fatherly love is \npartly instinctive, as are all forms of familial love; the father \ncannot help but love the child. \nMotherly Love Is Based on Feeling and Is Unconditional \nMotherly love is broader. It is based on feeling, rather than \non reason. True mother love is unconditional. We can say that \nin many ways it is more spiritual and therefore greater than most \nhuman expressions of love. God implanted in the heart of the \nmother a love for the child that is unconditional, regardless of \nthe child's merit or behaviour. Even if the child in later life be-\ncomes a murderer, the mother's love remains steady, unchanged; \nwhereas the father may be more impatient and less inclined to \nforgive. The unconditional love of the mother is perhaps the \nhuman love closest to the perfection of God's love. The true \nmother forgives her son even when no one else will. That kind \nof love exemplifies God's love; He forgives His children no mat-\nter what sins they have committed. Now who could have placed \nthis love in the mother's heart, save God? In true maternal love \nGod gives us distinct proof that He loves us unconditionally, no \nmatter how wicked we are, or how many times we have sinned. \nThe Divine Spirit is not a tyrant.

When their love is expressed in its \nhighest form, it results in a perfect unity. But this love, too, has \nits flaw; it can be tainted by the abuse of sex, which eclipses di-\nvine love.

But if it becomes the \nsupreme factor in that relationship, love flies out the door and \ndisappears completely; in its place come possessiveness, over-\nfamiliarity, and the abuse and loss of friendship and understand-\ning.

For example, Madame Amelita Galli-Curci* and \nher husband, Homer Samuels, are the greatest lovers I have \nmet in the West. Their love is beautiful because they practise \nthese ideals of which I speak. When parted even for a short \ntime, they eagerly look forward to seeing each other again, to \nbeing in each other's company, to sharing their thoughts and \nlove. They live for each other. \nThe relationship between Ella Wheeler Wilcoxt and her \nhusband is another beautiful example of conjugal love. Mr. \nJohn Larkin, a student of mine who knew them, told me that \nhe had never seen anything like their love. He said, \"Each time \nthey met, it was as if they experienced again the joy of the first \ntime. They were utterly devoted to each other. For three years \nafter his death, her constant thought was of reunion with him; \nthen she passed on, his name on her lips.\" \nI met a man of similarly unselfish devotion in this country. \nHe deeply loved his wife, so much so that his love for her became \ntransmuted into divine love. After she died, he wandered for \nyears, seeking a way to find her again. At last he did succeed. In \nthe end, he found God through his love for her. This is the story \nas he told it to me: In his wanderings after her death, he sought \nout a great saint in the Himalayas. He persuaded the holy man to \npromise to give spiritual initiation to him and his wife together. \nAfter assuring him of his promise, the saint asked, \"Where is \nyour wife?\" The husband then told him that she was dead. The \nsaint nevertheless kept his promise to give initiation to the two \n* World-renowned soprano (1889-1963) who met Paramahansa Yogananda dur-\ning his early years in the United States.

He instructed the man to sit in meditation, and began \nto invoke the presence of the wife. Suddenly she appeared. For a \nlong time she talked with her husband. Then the two sat together \nand received initiation from the saint. Afterward, the holy one \nblessed them, and the wife departed. From that moment, the hus-\nband realized that the beloved form he had known as his wife was \nin reality an individualized manifestation of the consciousness of \nGod—as is every human being. The true meaning of divine love, \nwhich is behind and responsible for every ideal human relation-\nship, was revealed to him. His was a unique and true experience. \nBut conjugal love is tricky, and most people leave this world \nwith an unsatisfied heart. They have not sought marital love in \nthe right way. Attracted mostly by pleasing appearance, they look \nfor their soul mate in a graveyard of beautiful, nicely dressed \nforms, unmindful that a devil may be housed within. I am not \ncondemning man and woman for responding to the God-created \nlaw of attraction; I am condemning the perversion of that attrac-\ntion through lustfulness. Every man who looks upon a woman as \nan object of lust, and who abuses woman to satisfy his lust, com-\nmits self-destruction: Continued sex-abuse impairs the nervous \nsystem and affects the heart, eventually destroying peace and \nhappiness. Mankind must realize that the basic nature of the soul \nis spiritual. For man and woman to look upon each other only as \na means to satisfy lust is to court the destruction of happiness. \nSlowly, bit by bit, peace of mind will go. \nThe abuse of sex is comparable to running a car without \noil; the body cannot stand it. Each drop of vital essence lost is \nequivalent to the loss of eight drops of blood. But the impor-\ntant point to remember is to learn self-control. This comes \nwith control and purification of the mind, and is far superior to \nabstaining outwardly from sex when the mind is yet dwelling \non it. Mere suppression can be harmful. \nMan and woman should look upon one another as reflec-\ntions of the Divine. I find it very sweet when a husband calls the \nwife \"Mother,\" or when she calls him \"Father.\" Every woman \nshould look upon man as a father. My attitude toward woman is \nas toward a mother. In my eyes she is not merely a woman, but \nan expression of the Divine Mother. It is Divine Mother I behold \nspeaking to me through woman. \n"}

It is \nsaid that a woman's three-inch tongue can kill a man six feet \ntall. When man and woman mistreat each other, they destroy \nforever their happiness together. Man should strive to see the \nGod in woman, and to help her realize her spiritual nature. He \nshould make her feel that she is with him not merely to sat-\nisfy his sensual appetite, but as a companion whom he respects \nand regards as an expression of the Divine. And woman should \nlook upon man in the same way. \nAnother wrong attitude is fear of the opposite sex; abnormal \naversion, like abnormal attraction, is an unhealthy attitude. \nFrom my master, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, * I learned to regard \nwoman, not as an instrument created for the entrapment and \nmoral destruction of man, but as a representative of the Divine \nMother of the Universe. If and when man begins to look upon \nwoman as a mother symbol, he will find in her a loving protec-\ntion he has never seen before. Through God's grace, I have been \nable to change the consciousness of many men and women with \nthis spiritual thought: Every man should look upon woman as a \nsymbol of the Mother of the Universe, and every woman should \nlook upon man as a symbol of the Father of the Universe. When \nthose persons left my presence, they felt that the Divine Mother \nand the Heavenly Father had spoken through me, because I ad-\ndressed them from that divine consciousness. \nI wonder if there would be any conjugal love at all, if there \nwere no such thing as sex attraction. Ordinary persons would \nnot have the capacity to feel such love, but those who are spir-\nitually developed would, because they are not attracted on the \nbasis of sex. Those who have cultivated their soul qualities \nknow that sex has nothing to do with true love. If you develop \nthe perfect love of your soul, you will begin to get a glimpse of \nthe Divine.

The more money and kindness given by the \nmaster, the more the servant loves him. The greater the service \nrendered by the servant, the more warmly the master regards \nhim. This can be a relationship of love, but its basic motiva-\ntion is the security each gives to the other. \nFriendship—Grandest Relationship of Human Loves \nThe relationship that exists between friends is the grand-\nest of human loves. Friendly love is pure, because it is without \ncompulsion. One freely chooses to love his friends; he is not \nbound by instinct. The love that manifests in friendship can ex-\nist between man and woman, woman and woman, man and \nman. But in the love of friendship, there is no sexual attraction. \nOne must practise celibacy and absolutely forget sex if one \nwants to know divine love through friendship; then friendship \nnurtures the cultivation of divine love. Such pure friendship \nhas existed between saints and between others who truly love \nGod. If you once know divine love, you will never part with it, \nfor there is nothing else like it in the whole universe. \nLove gives without expecting anything in return. I never \nthink of anyone in terms of what he can do for me. And I never \nprofess love to someone because he has done something for \nme. If I didn't actually feel love, I wouldn't pretend to give it; \nand since I feel it, I give it. I learned that sincerity from my \nMaster. There may be some who do not feel friendly toward \nme, but I am a friend to all, including my enemies,- for in my \nheart I have no enemies. \nLove cannot be had for the asking; it comes only as a gift \nfrom the heart of another. Be certain of your feeling before you \nsay to anyone, \"I love you.\" Once you give your love, it must \nbe forever. Not because you want to be near that person, but \nbecause you want perfection for that soul. To wish for perfec-\ntion for the loved one, and to feel pure joy in thinking of that \nsoul, is divine love; and that is the love of true friendship. \nThe Unconditional Divine Friendship of Guru and Disciple \nThe relationship between guru and disciple is the greatest \nexpression of love in friendship; it is unconditional divine friend-\nship, based on a shared, singular goal: the desire to love God \n"}

Even in other noble forms of friendship there is \nsometimes diplomacy. But the friendship of the guru-disciple re-\nlationship is taintless. \nI can think of no relationship in this world greater than \nthat which I had with my Master. The guru-disciple relation-\nship is love in its supreme form. I once left his ashram, think-\ning I could more successfully seek God in the Himalayas. I was \nmistaken; and I soon knew I had done wrong. Yet when I came \nback, he treated me as if I had never left. His greeting was so \ncasual; instead of rebuking me, he calmly remarked, \"Let us \nsee what we have to eat this morning.\" \n\"But Master,\" I said, \"aren't you angry with me for leaving?\" \n\"Why should I be?\" he replied. \"I do not expect anything \nfrom others, so their actions cannot be in opposition to wishes \nof mine.

He thought \nmoney would make me happy; money would have been the \ngrave of my happiness.

He didn't even rebuke me. Yet at other times he always \ntold me clearly when I was wrong. He said, \"If my love can be \nbribed to compromise itself, then it is not love.

He loved me for myself. He wanted perfection for me. He \nwanted me to be supremely happy. That was his happiness. He \nwanted me to know God; to be with the Divine Mother for \nwhom my heart longed. \nWas that not divine love he expressed? to wish constantly \nto guide me in the path of goodness and love? When that love \nis developed between the guru and disciple, the disciple has no \ndesire to manipulate the master, nor does the master seek con-\ntrol of the disciple. Supreme reason and judgment govern their \nrelationship; there is no love like this. And I tasted of that love \nfrom my Master. \nGod's Love Sublimely Manifest in Bhagavan Krishna \nLord Krishna expressed in his life pure love in its highest \nform. He has shown to the world that a love without any impu-\nrity can exist between man and woman. It is impossible to de-\nscribe adequately his life for the general public, because it was \nunique and transcended mundane laws and standards. Someday \nI hope to put in print the true significance of Krishna's life, for it \nhas been much misunderstood and misinterpreted. His expres-\nsion of divine love was unique in this world. \nKrishna had many women disciples, but one favourite, \nRadha. Each disciple said to herself, \"Krishna loves me more than \nanyone else.\" Still, because Krishna often talked of Radha, the \nothers were envious of her. Noticing their jealousy, he wanted to \nteach them a lesson. So one day Krishna feigned a terrible head-\nache. The anxious disciples expressed their great concern over the \nMaster's distress. At last Krishna said, \"The headache will go \naway if one of you will stand on my head and massage it with \nyour feet.\" The horrified devotees exclaimed, \"We cannot do this. \nYou are God, the Lord of the Universe. It would be highest sacri-\nlege to dare to desecrate your form by touching your sacred head \nwith our feet!\" \nThe Master was pretending an increase of his pain when \nRadha came on the scene. She ran to her Lord, saying, \"What \ncan I do for you?\" Krishna made the same request of her that \nhe had made of the other devotees. Radha immediately stood \non his head; the Master's \"pain\" disappeared, and he fell asleep. \nThe other disciples angrily dragged Radha away from the sleep-\n"}

They understood why \nKrishna favoured her; for Radha alone had no thought for her-\nself, but only for her Lord's comfort. \nNevertheless, because she received much special attention, \nRadha became filled with pride. So one day the Lord Krishna said \nto her, \"Let us steal away together.\" He played on her vanity, \nmaking her think he wanted to be alone with her. She was feel-\ning very happy and favorued. They walked some distance, and \nKrishna wasn't at all inclined to stop for rest. Finally the weary \nRadha suggested, \"Here is a nice place to sit for a while.\" Krishna \nlooked disinterested and replied, \"Let us find a better spot.\" They \nwalked and walked. At last the exhausted Radha complained, \"I \ncannot walk any further.\" Krishna said, \"All right, do you want \nme to carry you?\" This very much pleased Radha's vanity. But \neven as she sprang to his back, lo! Krishna was gone; she fell in a \nheap on the ground. Her pride shattered, on her knees she humbly \ncried, \"My beloved Lord, I was wrong in wanting to possess and \ncontrol you. Please forgive me.\" Krishna reappeared and blessed \nher. Radha had learned a great lesson that day. It was a grievous \nerror to look upon the Master as an ordinary man, to be ensnared \nand controlled by feminine wiles. She realized that the Master \nwas interested not in her form, but in her soul. \nThe Perfect Love Between Soul and Spirit \nThe greatest love you can experience is in communion with \nGod in meditation.

So when the seed of God's consciousness \nwas planted in the soil of activity by His will, it sprouted into \na vast creation. \nBut it must be remembered that God is dreaming it all; that \nthis cosmic creation is nothing more than a dream condensation \nof God's thoughts. The first differentiation of Spirit was the man-\nifestation of pure thought. Then, projected out of the thought \nseed of His consciousness, came light, cosmic light. Conscious-\nness and light are the same, except that light is of greater density. \nThe thought of light is finer than the dream of light, in the same \nway that the thought of fire is purely a mental concept, but the \ndream of fire is a perceptible image. \nAfter God had willed light into dream existence, He con-\ntemplated what He had created. \"Well,\" He thought, \"this is \nnot exactly what I want, just light spread all over cosmic space. \nThere should be something more tangible.\" So He empowered \nthat dream cosmic light to become definite forms. Now here \nagain, do not forget the word dream in connection with cre-\nation.

God gave \nthese protons and electrons a further strength by which they \narranged themselves into atoms and molecules. With a still \nstronger thought, He caused the atoms and molecules to con-\ndense into gases, heat, liquids, and solids—all creations of His \nthought. The nebulas, or gases, came first. Then He began to \ndream into those nebulas a very strong force, and He willed: \"Let \nthese gases be condensed to produce heat, liquids, and solids.\" \nAnd according to His dream idea, it was so.

You can't imagine that He is merciful. But when you \nlook at the process of death with the eye of wisdom, you see \nthat after all it is merely a thought of God passing through a \nnightmare of change into blissful freedom in Him again. Saint \nand sinner alike are given freedom at death, to a greater or lesser \ndegree according to merit. In the Lord's dream astral worldt— \nthe land to which souls go at death—they enjoy a freedom such \nas they never knew during their earthly life. So don't pity the \nperson who is passing through the delusion of death, for in a lit-\ntle while he will be free. Once he gets out of that delusion, he \nsees that death was not so bad after all. He realizes his mortal-\nity was only a dream and rejoices that now no fire can burn \nhim, no water can drown him,- he is free and safe.t \nBut such is the delusion of desire for material things that, \n* The human body, with its unique occult centres in the spine and brain (see \nchakias in glossary), was a special creation by God to equip the soul with a ve-\nhicle capable of expressing its divine potential. \nt The astral world is the subtle sphere or \"heaven\" behind the gross physical \nworld. (See glossary.) \nt \"No weapon can pierce the soul; no fire can burn it; no water can moisten \nit; nor can any wind wither it \nThe soul is immutable, all-permeating, ever \ncalm, and immovable—eternally the same.

They simply believe, \nthinking it impossible to investigate and prove the scriptural \ntexts. \"We have only to believe,\" they assure themselves and oth-\ners; and that is to be accepted as all there is to religion. But the \nBible tells us that \"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the \nevidence of things not seen.\"* Faith is different from belief, \nwhich is only the first step. If I were to tell you that behind this \nbuilding there is a huge Hon, you would probably say, \"We don't \nsee how it could be possible!\" But if I insisted, \"Yes, there is a \nlion there,\" you would believe me to the extent that you would \ngo out and investigate. Belief was necessary in order to make you \nlook into it—and if you didn't see the lion, you would say that I \nhad told you a story! Similarly, if I want to persuade you to make \na spiritual experiment, you have to believe me before you will \ncarry it out. You can believe, at least, until you prove differently. \nFaith, however, cannot be contradicted: it is intuitive con-\nviction of truth, and it cannot be shaken even by contrary evi-\ndence. Faith can heal the sick, raise the dead, create new uni-\nverses. Jesus said, \"If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye \nshall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; \nand it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.\"t \nScience is reasonable, willing to alter its views in the light \nof new facts. It is sceptical about religion only because it has not \nexperimented in that field; although it is now beginning such \n* Hebrews 11:1. \nt Matthew 17:20. \n"}

The medical side is \nfairly well developed, though the causes and cures of certain ail-\nments are yet to be discovered. But what science does know, it \nis more or less sure about, because the various factors concerned \nhave been tested: theories have been tried and proven. In religion \nit is different. People are given certain facts or truths and told to \nbelieve them. After a little while, when their belief is not ful-\nfilled, doubt creeps in; and then they go from religion to religion \ntrying to find proof. You hear about God in churches and tem-\nples,- you can read about Him in books,- but you can experience \nGod only through Self-realization attained by practising definite \nscientific techniques. In India, religion is based upon such sci-\nentific methods. Realization is what India specialized in, and \nthose who want to know God should learn her methods; they \nare not India's sole property. Just as electricity was discovered in \nthe West, and we in India benefit from it; so India has discovered \nthe ways by which God can be known, and the West should \nprofit by them. By experimentation, India has proved the truths \nin religion. In the future, religion everywhere will be a matter of \nexperimentation; it will not be based solely upon belief. \nMillions of people are changing from one church to an-\nother without truly believing in their hearts what they have \nheard about God. They say, \"Well, I pray, but most of the time \nHe does not respond.\" Nevertheless, God is always aware of us. \nHe knows all about us, yet we remain absolutely ignorant of \nHim. This is the cause of the various kinds of doubts that play \nupon our minds. If God is, we must be able to know Him. Why \nshould we merely read and hear discussions about Him, and \nyet know nothing from personal experience? \nYet there is a definite way to experience God. And what is \nthat way? It is scientific experimentation with religious truths. \n"}

It is possible to put \nreligion into practice, to use it as a science that you can prove \nby experimenting on yourself. The search for Truth is the most \nmarvellous search in the world. Instead of being merely a mat-\nter of attending a Sunday service or performing one's puja, \nreligion must have a practical side. Learn how to build your life \naround spiritual ideals. Without practical application, religion \nis of little value. \nA man who used to own a ranch near here was quite ma-\nterialistic. I urged him to come to Encinitas from time to time, \nand he did so. After the first few visits, he said, with tears in his \neyes, \"I never realized there was a place whose very atmosphere \ncould speak so much of God's presence.\" You see, religion must \nbe practical. It must create some change in you—in your con-\nsciousness, and in your behavior. All those who have been com-\ning here regularly have changed their lifestyle for the better. \nThey have been spiritually influenced by this environment. \nSo religion must be experimented with, to prove it and \nmake it practical. Many churches do great social good, but they \ndo not show you how you can actually prove God to yourself, \nand how you can be in tune with Him. \nThe First Experiment Is Silence \nThe first experiment with religion must begin with si-\nlence. Most people never take time to be silent or to sit quietly \nin meditation. Hours and hours I remain in inner silence. When \nI am with people, I enjoy them immensely; I am with them \nfully and wholeheartedly. But when I am away from people, I \nam entirely alone in that supreme joy of life—the bliss of God. \nNo matter where I am, that joy of God is always with me. Why \ndon't you experiment with silence, so that you can live in this \nsame way? Most of you can't sit still for even ten minutes \nwithout your thoughts running away in all directions. You \nhave not learned to be at peace in your home within, because \nyou are always restlessly chasing about in your mind. My mas-\nter, Sri Yukteswar, used to say: \"Locking the door of the store-\nhouse of happiness, man runs everywhere else, begging for that \nhappiness.

You have nothing if you have \nnot God. You have everything if you have God; for He is the \nMaster of the universe. \nIf you haven't felt any results from religion, experiment in \nmeditation. Shake God out of His silence. You must insist: \n\"Lord, speak to me!\" If you make a supreme effort in the silence \nof the night and in the early morning, after a little while you will \nsee a glimmer of God's light or feel a ripple of His joy coming \nover your consciousness. Experimenting to know God in medi-\ntation, in silence, brings the most real, most remarkable results. \nScientists once thought that water was a single element. \nBut experiments later proved that two invisible elements, hy-\ndrogen and oxygen, come together in a certain combination to \nmake up water. Similarly, by religious experiment, wonderful \nspiritual truths are realized. When you sit quietly in medita-\ntion, and your mind is withdrawn within, you will have proof \nof God and of your own true nature. Experimentation with re-\nligious laws is marvellous because the result doesn't take place \noutside yourself; it is right within you. \nT h e End Result of Truth Is Always Good \nOnly the application of religious methods can bring lasting \nhappiness. One of the most important spiritual principles to ap-\nply is truthfulness. The meaning of truth is not clearly under-\nstood by most people. Truth is exact correspondence with Re-\nality; hence its end result is always good. Those who develop \nthe habit of telling little lies all the time will find it hard ever \nto be wholly truthful in any statement. Such chronic liars never \nthink of the importance of speaking truth; they don't even re-\nalize they are lying. Their own imagination becomes truth to \nthem, and they can no longer see the real truth in any situation. \nMany who do not understand the importance of speaking \ntruth rationalize their deceptions by saying, \"Well, if I always \ntell the truth I am sure to be gypped, because the rest of the \nworld doesn't work that way.

You could have replied, \n\"I am busy now, and I don't want to be disturbed.\" This truth-\nful statement is much better than even a little lie to shield \nfrom others' curiosity the fact of what you were doing. It is this \ntype of lying that most people get into. Avoid it, because it en-\ncourages a habit pattern of being untruthful, even when there \nis no need to evade the truth. \nIt is also wrong to speak the truth when, by doing so, one \nbetrays another person unnecessarily and to no good purpose. \nSuppose a man drinks, but tries to hide it from the rest of the \nworld.

If you unscrupulously take away others' dollars \nfor yourself, you may become rich, but you will never be happy, \nbecause their thoughts of resentment against you will-react \nupon you. The divine law is that whenever you try to make \nyourself happy at the cost of others' welfare, everyone will want \nto make you unhappy. But if you try to make others happy, even \nat the cost of your own contentment, everyone will think of \nyour welfare. Whenever you think of your own necessities, re-\nmember the needs of others, too. As soon as you feel concerned \nfor their well-being, you will want to make them happy.

It is a disgrace to behave like a discontented mor-\ntal, chasing one desire after another, when you are made in \nGod's immortal image of all-desire-quenching ever new joy. \nWhen immortals behave like mortals, they experience the \nalternations of pleasure, sorrow, and indifference in their na-\ntures. That is why you must destroy this changeable nature \ngrafted to your unchangeable, immortal nature. When you have \nfound your true soul-nature of everlasting joy, that indestructible \nbliss will remain with you throughout all experiences of life, \nwhether they be pleasant or disagreeable. Your joy will stand un-\nshaken amidst the crash of breaking earthly pleasures. You will \nenjoy everything with the Joy that is God. \"Unattracted to the \nsensory world, the yogi experiences the ever new joy inherent in \nthe Self. Engaged in divine union of the soul with Spirit, he at-\ntains bliss indestructible.\"* \n'Bhagavad Gita V:21. \n"}

This concept has influenced many to believe \nthat what is to be will be, and nothing can be done about it. \nFate does mean something ordained—but it is ordained by \nyou yourself, through the operation of the law of causation, or \nkarma. God gave you the freedom to choose how you will act; \nbut the law of causation governs the outcome according to the \nnature of the action. Thus every act becomes a cause that will \nproduce a certain kind of effect. When you have set in motion \na particular cause, the effect will inevitably correspond to that \ncause. Whether you do good or evil, you must reap the result \nof that action. So day by day you are creating the causes that \ndetermine your own fate. \nPerhaps daily at the dinner table you say, \"I will have a \nlittle bit more, please.\" After you have finished, you say, \"I \nshouldn't have eaten so much.\" This is human nature. We are \nthe funniest of all God's creatures. We call ourselves intelli-\ngent human beings, but we are slaves to our desires. Because \nyou eat that \"little bit\" extra every day, you \"suddenly\" find \nyou have heart trouble or stomach pains. Then sadly you ask, \n\"Why did this have to happen to me? I must have been fated \nto be sick.\" But that is not so. You forgot about having eaten \nthat \"little bit\" more, when you should have used self-control \nand taken a little bit less. If a motor is overloaded, and you add \nto that load, naturally it will be hard on the motor. It may give \nup. In the same way, you overworked your motor of digestion. \nThat was the cause, and it was created by you; your stomach \npains from ulcers or indigestion are merely the result. \n47 \n"}

However, it is not \nalways easy. \n(1) You can minimize the effect of an action. \n(2) You can resist the effect. \n(3) You can completely stop it. \nWhy do people go to doctors? Because that is one way to \nminimize \nthe effects of wrong actions. The physical way to \nlessen an illness or overcome it may be found in such remedies \nas proper diet, exercise, or medication. One Self-Realization \nstudent was recently healed of ulcers by a diet of bread and \nmilk. But lessening or removing effects may not necessarily \neliminate the cause. Under favourable circumstances the cause \nmay send forth new effects in the same or a different form. \nTo resist the effects of karma is to use commonsense reme-\ndies, but rely more on the power of the mind. Refuse to accept \nany limiting condition. Affirm and believe in health, strength, \nsuccess, even in the face of contradictory evidence. The effects of \nyour actions have much less power to hurt you when you do not \nallow the mind to give in to them. Remember that.

According to Lazarus' karma, \nhe was destined to die on a certain day. The law was fulfilled, and \nLazarus died. That was fated to be. But not even death is a fate \nirrevocable. Jesus satisfied the karmic law and brought Lazarus \nback to life again. How did he do it? He didn't just say, \"Come \nforth.\" Jesus saw where the soul of Lazarus had gone, after it had \nleft the physical form, and he first contacted that soul, encased in \nits astral (heavenly) body, in order to call it back again. But he \ndidn't call Lazarus back to a body that had already begun to rot.t \nJesus had to make that body whole again; he had to revive and \nrestore the body of Lazarus before the soul and life could enter in. \nOnly after the form had been made livable could he invoke \nLazarus to come forth in it. So Jesus did two things: First, he put \nhimself—his life and divine power—in the body of Lazarus. \nThus he could work out Lazarus' karma: he took that karma on \nhimself. Then, having freed the body of the cause of death, he \nrenewed the bodily cells so that they would live again, i This is \nhow Jesus could wake up Lazarus from the dead, even though \nthere was no way of reviving him according to natural law. \nIf the bulb in a lamp is broken, the light will go out. Un-\nless you replace the broken bulb with a new one, you cannot \nbring the light back again. Similarly, once the light of the soul \nleaves the body at death, it can't come back again except in a \n* Bhagavad Gita IV:37. \nt John 11:39. \nt \"The law of miracles is operable by any man who has realized that the essence \nof creation is light.

But great sages of old \nknew, as did Jesus, that when a body is fated to be destroyed by \ndeath, that same body can be revived again by one who knows \nhow to do it. Of course, raising the dead is an extreme case of \naltering fate; but it does show that man potentially has power \neven over death—the so-called inevitable fate. \nMahavatar Babaji* also demonstrated the power of restor-\ning life. A would-be disciple once sought out Babaji in the Hi-\nmalayas, where this great Master lives with a few highly \nadvanced disciples. The stranger asked to be received into the \nsacred band, vowing to jump from the mountain if his plea was \nrefused. Babaji said he could not accept him in his present state \nof development. The distraught devotee hurled himself over \nthe cliff, while the other disciples looked on in horror. Babaji \nthen told them to retrieve the body. The disciples obeyed, and \nlaid the lifeless form at the Mahavatar's feet. He touched the \nbroken body, healed it, and brought the devotee back to life. By \nhis act of total faith and devotion, the disciple had worked out \nthe last vestiges of bad karma that had made him theretofore \nunready to join Babaji's exalted company of devotees. The great \nGuru then accepted him as a disciple. \nOn another occasion, however, Babaji satisfied the karmic \nlaw by taking a devotee's karma on himself, thus mitigating the \ndestined fate of death—which only a true guru has the power to \ndo. The Mahavatar was sitting with Lahiri Mahasaya* and some \nother disciples. Before them a ceremonial fire was burning. Sud-\ndenly Babaji picked up a white-hot brand and hit the bare shoul-\nder of one of the disciples. Lahiri Mahasaya spoke up in aston-\nishment, questioning why the Guru had done such a terrible \nthing. Babaji looked at him and said: \"Would you rather have \nseen him burned to ashes before your eyes? It was his karma to \ndie a painful death by fire today.

Those who are with godlike \nsouls, in spirit and in truth, become godlike themselves. \nAvoid Wrong Behaviour to Prevent Unpleasant Results \nLet us talk about preventable causes now. You should con-\ntrol all impulses to behave wrongly: overcome chronic greed, \nchronic jealousy, chronic anger, and other such tendencies that \nkeep coming back all the time. All harmful emotions inside \nyou must be brought under your control. These states are \nremediable. But you don't try to rid yourself of them. \nMaterialists concentrate on treating the symptoms and \nsecondary causes. They don't believe in any deeper law or \ncause. They reason that when you start to break the laws of \nright behaviour, there must be two causes: the influence of bad \ncompany or environment that affects you adversely; and lack \nof self-control. This is true. \nBut those who go deeper, seeing into the real causes of \nman's suffering, say in addition that the degree of your suscep-\ntibility to these present causes is in direct proportion to the \nreal causes: the seed tendencies within you that have come \nfrom your past-life behaviour. Even if a doctor heals you of an \nailment, other diseases may come in its stead unless you have \novercome the habit that caused it in the first place. If someone \nis healed of ulcers by the doctor, but continues to eat the wrong \nfood, he will get ulcers again—or perhaps something worse. \nThe metaphysician would see the cause, which in this case is \ngreed—the habit from the past, and the present uncontrolled \ndesire to eat what he likes rather than what is good for him. \nThe metaphysician would then advise removal of the cause. \nAt the right time, and in the right environment, all good \nand bad actions of the past come to fruition, just as seeds sprout \nunder the right conditions. This explains why it is important al-\nways to mix with good company. You don't know what kinds \nof seeds, whether of disease or other negative happenings, are \ndormant within you.

The tendencies were already \nburied within you as a result of past living; your present actions \nprovided the necessary conditions for their resurrection. \nSo it is very unwise to mix with people who encourage any \nbad habit in you. You don't know what latent seeds of wrong \naction you carry within your consciousness. It is best not to \ngive those seeds any chance to grow. \nDo you see how deep these principles are? This subject of \novercoming fate or karma is the most wonderful philosophy. It \nproves that man can fully govern his own life. And that life is a \nbeautiful experience when you are not its slave, but its master. \nYour greatest enemies are your bad habits. They will follow \nyou from one incarnation to another until you overcome them. \nIn order to free yourself from fate, you must cure yourself of bad \nhabits. How? Good company is one of the best medicines. If you \nhave a tendency to drink, mix with people who do not. If you \nare suffering from ill health, be with people who have positive \nminds, who don't think about sickness. If you have the con-\nsciousness of failure, associate with those who have the con-\nsciousness of success. Then you will begin to change. \nEach of your habits creates a specific \"groove,\" or pathway, \nin the brain. These patterns make you behave in a certain way, \noften against your wish. Your life follows those grooves that \nyou yourself have created in the brain. In that sense you are not \na free person; you are more or less a victim of the habits you \nhave formed. Depending on how set those patterns are, to that \ndegree you are a puppet. But you can neutralize the dictates of \nthose bad habits. How? By creating brain patterns of opposite \ngood habits. And you can completely erase the grooves of bad \nhabits by meditation. There is no other way. However, you \ncan't cultivate good habits without good company and good \nenvironment.

Why \nshould you give up? Why should you think, \"I can't change, I \nam old, I am finished\"? You can change every day, any time \nyou want to.

That is the \nright kind of living. \nI used to know the elderly wife of a senator. She was a \nfanatic about liquor; and when her husband died, she threw it all \nout of the house.

She kept on this way for \nquite a few years, and remained enthusiastic, healthy, and happy. \nShe was no ordinary person, and I very much admired her spirit. \nMany people grow old before their time.

Feel young. It is the spirit \nwithin that keeps you young. Be enthusiastic. There are lots of \nyoung people who are already psychologically old and as good \nas dead. They have no ambition, no enthusiasm. They don't try \nto change. You are finished only when you say or think you are. \nNo matter how others judge you, your own decree of defeat is \nthe worst of all. You give up. \nThe moment you say, \"I have tried, but I can't contact God,\" \nyou are through. You won't get to Him.

He \nwill fast become a virtuous man and obtain unending peace. Tell \nall assuredly, O Arjuna, that My devotee never perishes!\"\" So if \nyou make the determination, \"I will keep on seeking God, even \nif I drop dead while trying,\" then know that you will feel God's \npresence,- you will find that He responds. \nAngels Are Made on Earth, Not in Heaven \nDon't depend on death to liberate you from your imperfec-\ntions. You are exactly the same after death as you were before. \nNothing changes; you only give up the body. If you are a thief \nor a liar or a cheater before death, you don't become an angel \nmerely by dying. If such were possible, then let us all go and \njump in the ocean now and become angels at once! Whatever \nyou have made of yourself thus far, so will you be hereafter. And \nwhen you reincarnate, you will bring that same nature with \nyou. To change, you have to make the effort. This world is the \nplace to do it. Man comes here for the sole purpose of learning \nto break the cords that bind his soul. Disease, failure, negation, \ngreed, jealousy—break these bonds now. You are in a cocoon of \nyour own bad habits, and you must get out of it by self-effort. \nThe butterfly of the soul must be freed to spread its wings of \nbeautiful divine qualities. If the silkworm is still in its cocoon \nwhen the silkman comes, it gets caught in a trap of its own \nmaking, and dies there. So do you weave silken threads of bad \nhabits about you, and you die still bound in them. \nTo the last day of your life, be positive; try to be cheerful. \nEven at the very end, don't think, \"I am finished.\" Instead of \npitying yourself, you should be thinking, \"O ye who are left on \nthis desolate shore still to mourn and deplore, it is I who pity \nyou.\" Death will not give you any trouble if you have a clear \n* Bhagavad Gita IX:30-31. \n"}

Every time you \nmeditate deeply on God, beneficial changes take place in the \npatterns of your brain. \nSuppose you are a financial failure or a moral failure or a \nspiritual failure. Through deep meditation, affirming, \"I and \nmy Father are one,\" you will know that you are the child of \nGod. Hold on to that ideal. Meditate until you feel a great joy. \nWhen joy strikes your heart, God has answered your broadcast \nto Him; He is responding to your prayers and positive thinking. \nThis is a distinct and definite method: \nFirst, meditate upon the thought, \"I and my Father are \none,\" trying to feel a great peace, and then a great joy in your \nheart. When that joy comes, say, \"Father, Thou art with me. I \ncommand Thy power within me to cauterize my brain cells of \nwrong habits and past seed tendencies.\" The power of God in \nmeditation will do it. Rid yourself of the limiting consciousness \nthat you are a man or a woman,- know that you are the child of \nGod. Then mentally affirm and pray to God: \"I command my \nbrain cells to change, to destroy the grooves of bad habits that \nhave made a puppet out of me. Lord, burn them up in Thy \ndivine light.\" And when you will practice the Self-Realization \n[Yogoda Satsanga] techniques of meditation, especially Kriya \nYoga, you will actually see that light of God baptizing you. \nBut you must concentrate; you must deeply commune with \nGod. Night is the best time for this. How wonderful it is to try \nto commune with God then—when the world around you is \nquiet. I have received my greatest experiences with God at night \nbefore I go to sleep. I never even think of sleep if I don't want to. \nI want to be with the Lord at night, and He takes care of me. \nThe Most Important Consideration Is to Be With God \nI never worry about the future or the past.

People judge \nwhat happens according to the way they live, and by the mea-\nsure of their own mind and intelligence. Self-interest, prejudices, \nhatred, and anger prevent true understanding of the events and \nmysteries of life. Only by communion with God can we com-\nprehend His divine laws, which are working everywhere. In spite \nof all the ruthless, desecrating ways in which man has wrought \ndestruction in God's creation, still we will find that evil destroys \nitself, and that the power of God marches on in the face of every \nopposition. \nThe end of the world has various connotations, as I shall \nshow you. First of all, there is the literal meaning. In this sense, \nthe end of the world is of two kinds: partial dissolution and \ncomplete dissolution. It will be a long, long time before we can \nexpect complete dissolution. Yet periodically some fanatical \ngroup predicts that the world is coming to an end. A few years \nago we read in the papers about a sect in New York whose leader, \nmisguided by mental phobia, or imagination, had frightened \nmany of his followers by such a prediction. Those who seek to \nhold their followers by instilling fear in them are not true teach-\ners. We should always be actuated by wisdom, never by fear. \nTo get back to my story: The members of this sect made \nready for the coming holocaust. They gave their property away \n59 \n"}

They waited and waited. Several days passed, and \ntheir hunger pangs were increasing. Still nothing happened, and \nthey finally gave up. Eventually, they had to institute lawsuits \nin order to get back their property. \nThis is just one instance in which people have been alarmed \nby predictions of war or some other major disaster. More often \nthan not, these proved to be false predictions. But in any case, \nwe need not be frightened. After all, what is life? It is a tempo-\nrary dream. Death is nothing but a sleep and another dream. \nWhen the dream is over, it is gone. Viewing it from that con-\nsciousness, I am not sorry for those who die on the battlefields, \nbecause for them the dream of torture is over. But I grieve for the \nwounded, because pain is a dreadful nightmare.

Naturally, it is hard \nto believe that others can have realizations that we ourselves do \nnot. But if you live for years in the mental world, whence God \nis sending forth these dreams of creation, and if you continu-\nously work with the divine powers of the mind, you can see, as \nI do, all the mysteries of God's creation unfold before you. \nThe Good and Evil Actions of Man \nAffect the Harmonious Balance of the Earth \nPartial dissolution of the world is brought on by the evil \nactivities of people in general. If we all begin to fight with \nexplosives, by this direct action we can reduce drastically the \nextent of civilization. And maybe if we work hard enough, we \ncan dissolve this world, too! God has given man the power of \ndestruction as well as the power of creation. We have made the \nworld beautiful, and we have the power to destroy it. When we \ndesecrate the world, the environment undergoes a violent \nchange, which is called partial dissolution. Such upheavals have \noccurred many times—one example is Noah's flood.

Don't think the happenings of this world are \ngoing on automatically without God's knowledge. And don't \nthink that man's actions have no effect on the operation of His \ncosmic laws. Everything that has happened throughout the ages \nis recorded in the ether. The vibrations of evil that mankind \nleaves in the ether upset the normal harmonious balance of the \nearth. When the earth becomes very heavy with disease and \nevil, these etheric disturbances cause the world to give way to \nearthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters. \nIt is the same as when you live wrongly for a long time; var-\nious inharmonies begin to manifest in your body, as well as cer-\ntain diseases. Disease is not a punishment. It is a poison that \nyou yourself create in the body, and the Lord wants you to get \nrid of it. But all too often, by the time you try to throw it off, \nthe body has become completely deranged, and you die. So, just \nlike the human body, the earth suffers from inharmonies and \ndisease. And it is because the combined actions of all people all \nover the world affect the planet on which we live. There is no \nquestion about that. The good and bad karmic conditions cre-\nated by man determine and influence the climate; they affect \nthe wind and the ocean, even the very structure of the earth, \nsometimes causing earthquakes. All the hatred, the anger, the \nevil we send out into the world, and the agony and rebellion \nthey cause—all these are disturbing the magnetic force of the \nearth, like static in the ether. In the destruction caused by this \nwar we are seeing a partial dissolution of the world—dissolu-\ntion of lives, money, homes. In many ways it is worse than \nNoah's flood; it is a flood of fire and bloodshed. But one thing is \nencouraging: the good karma of mankind is greater than the evil \nkarma. If this were not so, the earth would explode from the \nnegative vibrations. Contrary to appearances, the earth is in an \nascending cycle, and good will triumph. \nThe Life Cycles of the Earth \nThe world is a sort of living being, with a predetermined age. \nWe are the children of this great mother earth.

There is the young mother earth, the middle-aged mother \nearth, and the old-aged mother earth. The earth \"dies\" through \npartial dissolution, then reincarnates again to give human beings \nnew life, new strength, a new habitat in which to work out their \nkarma. Many times the earth has undergone partial dissolution \nand reincarnation. But complete death will come to the earth \nonly when it dissolves back again into God. \nI will explain briefly about the life cycles of the earth.* \nThese cycles consist of 24,000 years, divided into four yugas or \nages—12,000 years of ascending through these yugas to in-\ncreasing enlightenment, and then 12,000 years of descending \nthrough the yugas to increasing ignorance and materialism. \nEach of these half-cycles is called a Daiva Yuga. The earth has \nalready passed through many complete cycles since the dawn of \ncreation. The four ages of each Daiva Yuga are Kali Yuga, the \ndark or materialistic age,- Dwapara Yuga, the electrical or atomic \nage; Tieta Yuga, the mental age; and Satya Yuga, the age of truth \nor enlightenment. \nDwapara Yuga, the Present Cycle \nThe earth has already passed through Kali Yuga, the ma-\nterialistic age of 1,200 years' duration. According to the calcu-\nlations of my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar, we are about 240 \nyears into Dwapara Yuga, the second age, which consists of \n2,400 years. Now in its ascendancy, this is the electrical age, \neven though it may yet seem very materialistic. If you think \nabout it, you will see how man has progressed from compre-\nhending only gross matter to understanding and harnessing the \nenergy in matter. In this age, man will make great headway in \nthe electrical or electromagnetic field of science. \nAs Dwapara Yuga progresses, diseases will be treated and \nhealed more and more by rays. Vibratory energy can reach the \nelectronic factors of the atoms, the building blocks of matter, \nwhere gross chemicals cannot penetrate. After this war, you \nwill see a great surge of development in electrical science. Avi-\nation will develop tremendously also. Travel will be much, \n* See yuga in glossary. \n"}

Planes are still viewed with doubt by many \ntoday, just as trains were once looked upon with fear,- but planes \nare already taking over, and trains have become almost a thing \nof the past. Gradually, automobiles will come to be considered \nas carts. \nThe trouble in this second age is that there is not enough \nsecurity, because science plays the part of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. \nHyde. Man uses science not only to create and do good, but to \ndestroy as well. Therefore scientific development is not yet \nsafe. The present World War shows how the technology of sci-\nence is being used to destroy mankind. Out of the conflict we \nwill learn how to employ more scientific devices for human \ncomfort. But unless we develop spiritual forces, we will also \ncontinue to use scientific knowledge to destroy. \nPeople will learn from this war the devastating consequences \nof the misuse of technology. In the First World War, and in ear-\nlier times, it was considered chivalrous to fight. But the idea of \nchivalry has gone. In this war, no one wants to fight.

Brute force will be subdued only by mak-\ning mankind understand the eternal message of Christ and the \nGreat Ones: only by spiritual force will wars be stopped. \nUltimate peace will come when by mutual agreement all \nnations of the earth will have continued peace conferences, and \nwill scrap their weapons and instead help to destroy the earth's \nslums.

The karmic \nforces are at work to give India and other foreign-dominated \ncountries their independence. \nSpirituality Must Be Kept Strong in All Nations \nWhat is to be dreaded even more than this present war is \nthe godlessness of bolshevism, the greatest enemy. There is a \nstory that when a lion and a bear fought over the carcass of a \nstag, the bear was killed, and the lion had a broken back and \ncouldn't get to the deer.

National patriotism is not \nenough. If the ideal of God and brotherhood is taken away, there \nwill be no reason to live anymore. Who created this world? Who \ncreated us?

Treach-\nery, I think, is the most terrible of all crimes, the most dreadful \nof all evils in this world. Never be treacherous to your family, \nyour neighbours, or your friends. And never be treacherous to \nyour country; those who cannot be faithful to their country can-\nnot be faithful to God. Remember the story of the bat.

But if you sit still \nand persist long enough, you will begin to feel that wonderful \nsilence of God. When your mind is withdrawn, centered in \nHim, the world is forgotten and you find in that silence a hap-\npiness greater than any worldly pleasure. That state, when you \nare totally absorbed in inner awareness of God, no longer con-\nscious of the world, is called sabikalpa \nsamadhi. \nIt is \"partial \ndissolution of the world\" because, when you return to ordinary \nconsciousness, the delusions of the world will again somewhat \naffect you, unless you are highly evolved and free of all desires \nand attachments. \nThe second and highest state of samadhi \nis when you are \nin the world but not of it—carrying on your duties, but every \nmoment conscious of God.

The Yoga Sutras or aphorisms of the sage \nPatanjali are tabloids of truth. He begins by saying: \"Now I speak \nof the discipline of Yoga,\" which sets the theme for his exposi-\ntion of the Eightfold Path of Yoga. \nOf the six principal systems of Hindu philosophy, t Sankhya \nexpounds the why of religion, Vedanta describes the end to be \nattained, and Yoga provides the method for that attainment. \nTogether, these concepts constitute true religion, whose twofold \npurpose is to show man how to avoid suffering and how to con-\ntact the bliss of the Supreme One: that lasting happiness which \nis not conditioned by either painful or pleasant experiences.i \nThus religion has two phases. \nSankhya philosophy has to do with the first phase, point-\ning out that the primary goal of everyone is the avoidance of \nspiritual, mental, and physical suffering. However, we can live \nin a painless state and still not be happy. There are a lot of peo-\nple who are suffering, and a few who are not, but it doesn't nec-\nessarily follow that those who are for the moment unafflicted \nare happy. The state of painlessness is agreeable, but is not it-\nself happiness-producing. To attain true and lasting happiness, \nwhich Vedanta describes as the end or second phase of religion, \na full understanding and application of the principles of religion \nare necessary. This is Yoga. \n* The oldest text extant on the sacred science of yoga is Patanjali's Yoga Su-\ntras [also known as Patanjali's Aphorisms), which outlines the principles of \nthe yogic path.

But you \ndon't know what is coming tomorrow. The possibility of suf-\nfering is there. The ordinary human being is not free from that \npossibility. This is why Sankhya says that you should follow \nthose divine laws by which you will be freed permanently from \nthe causes of physical, mental, and spiritual suffering, so there \nis no possibility of their recurrence. \nBut Vedanta philosophy explains that this is not enough; \nthis is not the whole end of religion. If you experience only the \npeace of mere absence of pain, sorrow, or excitement, you will \neventually say, \"Knock me on the head to relieve this bore-\ndom.\" You don't want to be merely peaceful. A person who has \nhad too much of peace, without positive happiness, is willing \nto accept even sorrow in order to have a little change in his life. \nBeyond peace is the state of divine consciousness, ever new \nbliss that will never grow stale. Religion not only frees you \nfrom all suffering, but binds you to this eternal happiness, to \ncosmic happiness in God. Religion kills the germs of sorrow, \nso they can't infect your happiness. It destroys the roots of suf-\nfering, and ensures attainment of positive Bliss. \nYoga Fulfils the Purpose of Religion \nHow to reach that state? Patanjali says that after studying \nSankhya, you should study Yoga. That is, once you understand \nwhy you should be religious, you must learn how. You have to \nknow the way to remove whatever suffering is already present \nin your body, mind, and soul, and to avoid that which might \narise in the future. \nSo long as you are still in the domain of suffering, so long \nyou cannot be free from sorrow. You may be thinking, \"Is that \nfreedom possible?\" Well, it was possible for Jesus, wasn't it? \nWhat was the purpose of Jesus' life unless to demonstrate what \nyou too can do? That purpose is not fulfilled in just worship-\nping Jesus. His life was meant to inspire every one of us to be \nlike him. Salvation is for all. Freedom from this jail of life is \nfor all.

St. Francis is free. Patanjali is \nfree. Free souls! That is what this teaching of Self-Realization \n[Yogoda Satsanga] is for: to free your soul from all possibility of \nsuffering. \nSo Yoga shows you the way and gives the method. And \nVedanta describes the end—that after freeing yourself from suf-\nfering by finding God, you will have eternal happiness, eternal \njoy, eternal wisdom, eternal existence. That state is so desirable! \nYou will be conscious of your blissful existence, and you will \nknow that you are immortal. This experience is indescribable. \nIf you tell people that you are following a Hindu religion— \nor for that matter, any religion other than their own—prejudice \nimmediately arises in their minds. But Patanjali goes beyond all \npersonalities and dogmas. He states that Yoga is the heart of all \nreligions; it is the science of religion, by which the true princi-\nples of religion can be proven with exact and known results. \nYoga fulfils the purpose of religion: achievement of oneness, or \nunion, with God—the ultimate necessity of every soul. \nThe Universal Science of Religion \nIndia's rishis, her great sages, regarded religion as a science, \nthe practice of which severs the bonds of human suffering and \nreunites the consciousness with the cosmic joy of God, in \nwhose image we are made. Yet many people hesitate: \"Oh, I \nam not ready for spirituality.\" This is tbe greatest untruth one \ncan speak. Why? Because the soul is like a round peg that will \nnot fit into the square hole of delusion. The one thing that \neveryone is seeking—unalloyed happiness—the world cannot \ngive. Hence there are thousands of unhappy people throughout \nthe world. \nSome whom I have met have everything I once thought I \nwanted; yet they have not found happiness in the fulfilment of \nthose desires. I sought God first, and I found that His joy is all-\nsatisfying, ever new, more tempting than any temptation. \nSince everyone's ultimate desire is to be happy and to have \nthe joy of making others happy, and since God is the source of \nall happiness, there is no way you can avoid Him. And why \nshould you? All else will betray you with lies and false prom-\nises,- for naught but God can give you true and lasting joy. \n"}

When \nthe scriptures or the saints advise you not to do a thing, use your \nlogic and you will see that it is in your highest interest not to \ndo it.

Abuse of this sacred power is destructive to the \nnervous system and general health. Secondly, the emotional \ncomplications upset the heart, which is the center of feeling. \nOne should never toy with the heart of another. \nIt is unwise and unkind to marry unless you are absolutely \nsure that the person you have chosen is someone you will \nwant to live with the rest of your life. Never marry with the \nidea that if it doesn't work out you can always separate.

To help you prevent this, \nreligion teaches the eternal principles of self-control and moder-\nation, by which you can master sensual instincts. Take the sense \nof taste, for example.

There is nothing more \npure, and more purifying, than wisdom. \nA Reason for Every Law \nThere is a reason behind every spiritual injunction. And \nthe exposition of these reasons is the purpose of Sankhya. \n\"Honour thy father and mother.\" Why? Father and mother \nare representatives of God. They are but masks for the Divine \nParent. Never insult the Divine Parent behind those father and \nmother forms. Honour them because God is in them. He gave \nthem to look after you. But if father and mother urge the child \nto forsake God and righteous ways, then another law comes \ninto play. No parent has the right to dissuade a child from seek-\ning God and following truth. That is the one time the father \nand mother may be disobeyed; for our loyalty is to God, who \nloves us through our parents. \n\"Thou shalt not kill.\" Why? Some interpret this to mean \nwe should not kill animals. Others say it means we should not \nkill human beings. And if you take the position that we should \nnot kill anything, then we will not be able to eat at all; because \neating vegetables is also taking life. Wanton destruction of any \nform of life is wrong—and especially so in the case of its higher \nexpressions in animals and man. Life is a manifestation of God \nand rightfully commands our reverence. \"Thou shalt not kill\" \nwas intended mainly as a commandment against killing one's \nown kind, humankind. It is wrong to take the life of another hu-\nman being, because you have no right to deprive someone else \nof the same privilege of existence that you enjoy. You shouldn't \ntake from anyone else something you yourself don't want to \npart with. The greatest love man has is for himself; so killing is \nwrong, because you wrest from another the very thing that you \nlove most. A second reason is that every individual is created \nby God, in His image. Since you are not the maker of life, since \nyou cannot create life, it is not your prerogative to destroy it. \nAnd a third reason is that God has built this school of life on \nearth where souls can come and learn; you do wrong if you de-\nprive a soul of his schooling here.

Truths are not truths \nto you unless you realize them within yourself. Without real-\nization, they are just ideas. This is why, before spiritual devel-\nopment comes, individuals, and nations too, go through ruts of \nspiritual suspicion: what is spirituality? why is it necessary? will \nit really make me happier? what is truth? Doubt is removed only \nby realization. So the best laboratory in which to test truth is \nyour own Self-realization; for spiritual perception, spiritual \nconsciousness, lies not in vague theological ideas, but in the \nacquisition of Self-realization. Individual knowledge and the \nknowledge of nations should be tested by this criterion. \nThe word \"truth\" has been so abused that it has come to \nmean most anything one wants it to, especially when used to \nconnote spiritual ideas. In everyday living, truth is a con-\nsciousness that is guided by spiritual wisdom, which propels us \nto do certain things, not because anybody says to, but because \nthey are right. \nTruth cannot be monopolized by any group or individual. \nEvery human being has a right to express truth within his own \nlife. Its expressions may be various, but its substance will ever \nbe one and the same. This is what makes it so interesting. Truth \ncannot be circumscribed. It is eternal. It will keep on manifest-\ning eternally, through cosmic law and through enlightened \nhuman beings, whether or not the majority of the world accepts \nit. Fortunately, the cosmic absolutes are not dependent on \nman's belief and sanction. \nSpiritual Consciousness Obeys All the Rules \nThat Make Life Complete \nSpiritual consciousness means the use of superwisdom, \ntruth, to do the things that supremely benefit yourself and oth-\ners. Dwell on that thought. It includes selfless service to oth-\ners, right behavior, adherence to hygienic and all other laws of \nlife, and a harmonious performance of all your duties, material \nand spiritual, without allowing one duty to contradict another. \n"}

Some people be-\ncome artists, for example, and in the pursuit of art they forget \nother practical and spiritual duties. Certainly, art is a beautiful \nexpression, and may well convey spiritual ideas; yet the man \nwho produces it may not be spiritual. To live a contradictory \nlife—to do one duty and use it as an excuse to neglect other \nduties—is to live unspiritually. When you perform all duties \ncheerfully, without letting any duty upset your inner calm and \nhappiness, and when you avoid any contradiction of duties \nthat makes your life unbalanced, you will have true spiritual \nhappiness. The trend of all your mind and consciousness will \nbe turned back toward the source, toward God. Spiritual con-\nsciousness is the supreme consciousness you must attain in \norder to have a harmonious and peaceful existence. Without \nthat spiritual balance in life, happiness is impossible. To live \na contradictory life is to be unbalanced, and to lead an unbal-\nanced life is a sure way to unhappiness. \nThe Inner Versus the Outer World \nThe senses are at the root of material consciousness. The \nordinary individual is more inclined toward the world and mate-\nrial things than toward spiritual things, because the searchlights \nof his senses are directed outward. He is playing the five search-\nlights—of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch—on material \nobjects and pleasures. This is why everything outside seems \nbeautiful and enjoyable. You never behold the \"inner world\" \nunless these searchlights are reversed and concentrated within. \nOnly if you learn not to be carried away by the operation of the \nsenses will you be able to enjoy spiritual consciousness. \nWhen you withdraw your mind inward, you will begin to \nperceive that there are many more wonderful things within \nthan outside.

You \nmust live differently than the ordinary man, who is in touch \nonly with sense consciousness. Spiritual consciousness lies in \nabsolute victory over human consciousness. Now, spirituality \ndoes not mean only to meditate; it embraces a very wide field \nof controlled existence. However, meditation is the best foun-\ndation. It is the greatest way to be spiritual, the simplest way to \nspiritualize the consciousness. It will bring into your life all the \ngood you have ever dreamed of acquiring. But to meditate, on \nthe one side, and be angry or lead a desultory life on the other, \nis like putting your feet in two boats going in opposite direc-\ntions. You must not only meditate, but also learn to behave. To \nhave spiritual consciousness is to be able to do those things that \nare in your highest interest.

Every person should \nkeep a mental diary. Mental diaries are much better than mate-\nrial ones, which are objects of curiosity to others. Many people \nwrite down nice thoughts and resolutions in their diaries, and \nthen promptly forget about them. It is better to keep a mental \ndiary in which you constantly watch your thoughts and actions. \nAt certain times during the day have a check-up on your phys-\nical, mental, and spiritual machines, to see how they are be-\nhaving. This will help develop your spiritual consciousness. \nGod alone will look into your mental diary. If you fill it \nwith right thoughts and behaviour, it is your passport to \nheaven. So put into your mental diary only the things that are \ngood. Do not listen to negative things, do not talk negatively, \ndo not think negative thoughts. Let no action of yours cause \nanything negative in others; harm to others acts as a \nboomerang and hurts you most of all. Sin is not like dynamite, \nwhich you can explode from a distance without harm to your-\nself. It has to be defused within your own soul. \nNever be mean. Have resentment toward none. I prefer \nsome sinners with good hearts to some so-called good people \nwho are bigoted and uncompassionate. To be spiritual is to be \nbroad, to understand and forgive, and to be a friend to all. \nIf you say you are a friend to all, it should be true. If you \nproffer friendship, you must mean it. You must not show kind-\nness or cooperation outside, and inside feel the opposite. Spir-\nitual law is very powerful. Don't go against spiritual principles. \nNever deceive or be treacherous. As a friend, know when to \nmind your own business; understand your place; know when \nyou should have the willingness to cooperate, and when you \nshould have the will to noncooperate. \nIf you make people feel you are their friend, if they know \nyou are a friend ready to help, that is a wonderful power to live \nby.

I reasoned \nwith him: \"You have made up your mind to smoke, and your \nparents do not want you to. You have succeeded in defeating \nyour parents, but you have not succeeded in defeating your \nunhappiness.

He began to weep, saying, \"They \nare always beating me.\" \nI went on: \"Think of what you have done to yourself. Come \non, I will take you on condition that I will be your friend but \nnot your detective. As long as you are willing to mend your mis-\ntakes, I will be your helper. But if you lie to me, I will do noth-\ning for you. Lying destroys friendship.\" I added, \"Any time you \nwant to smoke, don't do it behind my back; rather, tell me, and \nI will get you the cigarettes.\" \nOne day he came to me and said, \"I feel a terrible desire to \nsmoke.\" I gave him money and told him to go and buy the cig-\narettes. He could not believe his eyes. \n\"Take back the money,\" he said. \nI was pushing him to go, but he would not go.

I \nhad roused the spiritual consciousness in him. \nSincerity and Intensity of Effort Is What Counts \nSpiritual consciousness lies in the sincere internal effort to \ngo upstream toward real lasting happiness. Many people say \nthey are following a righteous course, but very few are really \nmaking a sincere effort. It isn't demanded of you that you be an \nangel all at once. Since only the Absolute is perfect, we can say \nthat before God even the best angel is a sinner. But saints are \nsinners who did not give up. No matter what your difficulties, \nif you do not give up, you are making progress in your struggle \nagainst the stream. To struggle is to win the favour of God. You \nmust make that supreme effort.

The American spirit is to try to create something \nnew and better. In Washington, D.C., millions of patents have \nbeen registered. Your creative ability is wonderful to see. No \none should live without creative effort. If you haven't exercised \nyour will power to accomplish something difficult in life, you \nhaven't lived up to the standard of a child of God. You have in-\nsulted the image of God within. You must exercise your divine \ngift of creativity in some way. It is never too late. Do you know \nwhat old age is? It is when your mind becomes \"hardboiled\"— \naccepting the limitations imposed by body-consciousness and \nclosing its doors to creative thinking. I have had people of all \nages, some of them ready to step into the grave, telling me all \nthe things they intend to accomplish, and how much money \nthey are going to make! \nIt is better to try to achieve or to create something worth-\nwhile, for to live idly is to do yourself the worst possible harm. \nWhat you don't realize is that in life you cannot stand still. You \ngo either backward or forward. And most of you go backward, \nbecause your will is stationary, inert. So you must be watchful \nnot to be physically or mentally lazy, not to imitate others \nrather than be creative. \nIf you have not achieved anything in life, you may as well \nconsider yourself dead, because like a zombie you are moving \ntoward the valley of death. But every time you make use of your \nwill power, God says, \"This person has done rightly,- he has \nused his God-given will power.\" Everything you do is recorded \nwithin yourself. The effect of each positive action is locked up \nin your brain, and that mental tabloid tendency becomes a \n"}

And to achieve something, whether mental or physical, \nis to be favored by God. \nHow much better it is to use that power of mind than to \nlet it ossify and become like a fossil: for millions of years it lies \nin the sunshine and doesn't change. A person with a mind like \nthat is done for. He cannot make a success of life. So don't be \na mental fossil; be a living tree, constantly spreading out new \ngrowth. The strong-hearted soul says, \"There is sunshine in my \nlife, and I have every chance to throw out shoots and branches \nof accomplishment. One day I will be a success: the Lord of the \nuniverse shall come to bless and praise the fruits that I have \ncreated.\" So develop your mind, be creative. \nWork on Your Progress With God \nIf you are not accomplishing anything in life, make a start: \nWatch your health—change your diet, if necessary,- give up bad \neating habits. Change your thinking—give up negative, dark \nthoughts, and be more positive, so that you can acquire some-\nthing materially when you wish to. Above all, work on your \nprogress with God. This is the most important of all creative \nthinking. If your will is being broken in spite of your spiritual \nresolve, do something about it. Everything will come to tempt \nyou as soon as you want God. You are made to feel that in \nworldly diversions you will find happiness, but that diversion \ntakes you away from your spiritual pursuits and destroys your \nwill power. When I started on this path, never did I go to movies \nor seek other such distractions. I meant business with God—and \nnow, after finding Him, whatever I do is like child's play. He has \ngiven me everything; but there is nothing more interesting to me \nthan that constant communion within myself with the Beloved \nof my universe. \nComplete surrender to God is the only goal in life I could \nconceive of. It is only through God, and in God, that I can see \nthe perfection I had sought, and so it is to Him alone that I can \ngive my complete allegiance; for everything else disillusions \nus. When you watch people with the eyes of wisdom, everyone \nfalls short. Only God satisfies. He gave to me more than I ever \nexpected in life. I had refused to think as others were thinking, \n"}

It \nis because you think you are licked that you are licked; but no \nmatter how many times you are bowed by the bludgeons of cir-\ncumstances, lift up your head again! Tell yourself, \"My body \nmay be beaten, but my spirit is not conquered.\" That is the \nway to have success. Power of mind, the power of creation, is \nnecessary. Then you know the joy of accomplishment. \nMake the Best of Circumstances \nNineteen years have gone by since I came here to America. \nWhen I see what I have been able to achieve I have no complaint, \nI have no regrets.

God doesn't \nexpect you to do spectacular things, but He does want you not to \nbe a lazybones. He wants you to use all the power you have. Oth-\nerwise, as His child, you desecrate His name. Whatever your \npresent circumstance, make the best of it. No matter how many \ntimes you fall down, get up with the determination to be victo-\nrious.

Many of you think you don't even have \nany seeds of success in you, but you do have. You can succeed. \nYou can make it. But if you think, \"I am done for,\" you are fin-\nished right then; you have already given yourself the decree \nthat you have failed.

So many people make themselves helpless by wrong \nhabits. Get away from those persons who influence you to do \nevil.

You have been \nthinking that you can't do anything with yourself; you have hyp-\nnotized your will to accept that thought.\" I told her to exercise \nby walking, to eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and nuts, and to cut \nout all starchy foods and sweets. I reminded her that in the be-\nginning her mind would urge her to take a little something sweet, \nand she would be tempted to give in. \"But you must make up \nyour mind that you are going to lose weight, and then follow \nthrough, with will power,\" I said. Several months later I saw this \nwoman again and I asked, \"Is this you?\" \"Yes,\" she answered; \"it \nis so wonderful.\" She had lost her heaviness and looked so much \nyounger and happier. \n"}

If you see \nthat you are not pleasing God, ask yourself how you can better \nplease Him: how you can be nicer to everyone; how you can \nmeditate deeper. Think, and then act. This is the way to develop. \nMake God Break His Vow of Silence \nNo matter what happens, if you are more and more with \nGod, you will find that He is with you always. But will you \nmake that effort? Every day, in the beginning, my mind used to \nsay, \"You can't know God. Only great ones like Krishna, Jesus, \nand Buddha could.\" Then I would reason, \"If God favoured \nthem, He is partial; but I know He is not—He does not favour \nanyone. Even they had to go through great trials. But they were \ndivinely successful, so I too can realize God.\" \nMake the effort to find God by trying to convince Him that \nyou want Him, and by trying to bend His will to speak to you. \nYou have to make God break His vow of silence; then He will \nspeak.

The evi-\ndence of evil is here in the world. You cannot deny it. If there \nis no evil, why would Jesus pray, \"Lead us not into temptation, \nbut deliver us from evil\"?* He is saying plainly that evil does \nexist. \nSo the truth is, we do find evil in the world.

But it was not \ngood for Judas that he chose to be the one whose dark deed, by \ncontrast, extolled the glories of Christ's triumph over evil. \nPerfection Is Not to Be Found in This World \nIt is hard to know where the dividing line is between good \nand evil. Certainly it is terrible that bacteria kill two billion \npeople every hundred years. But think of the chaos of overpop-\nulation if there were no death! And if everything here were good \nand perfect, no one would leave this earth of his own accord; no \none would want to go back to God. So in a sense misery is your \nbest friend, because it starts you seeking God. When you begin \nto see clearly the imperfection of the world, you will begin to \nseek the perfection of God. The truth is that God is using evil, \nnot to destroy us, but to make us disillusioned with His toys, \nwith the playthings of this world, so that we might seek Him. \nThis is why the Lord Himself permits injustices and evil. \nBut I have said to Him, \"Lord, You have never suffered. You \nhave always been perfect. How do You know what suffering \nis? Yet you have put us through these tests; and You had no \nbusiness doing it.

The Lord answers, \"You don't have to go on suffering; I \nhave given everyone the free will to choose good instead of \nevil, and thus come back to Me.\" \nSo evil is the test of God to see if we will choose Him or \nHis gifts.

That is why I \nquarrel with God and scold Him, \"Why have You created all of \nthese terrible temptations that Your children succumb to?

Such are the \ndeadly instruments of destruction they are creating, instead \nof developing the weapon of love, which can destroy all the \nhatred, meanness, and selfishness in men's hearts. In war, each \nside always blames the other's actions as the cause of conflict. \nBut remember, you can't clap with just one hand; you have to \nhave two hands. True, some people or nations are more evil at \ntimes than others; but those who are good should conquer evil, \nnot by evil, but by good. \nYou must love people. Sometimes it is hard, I know. I have \nloved my enemies, and I know that I shall never be an enemy \nto anyone. By a thought I could destroy them,- but I have never \ndone it, and I shall never do it. Jesus had that power. He could \nhave used it when his enemies taunted him to save himself \nfrom the cross; he had said, \"Thinkest thou that I cannot now \npray to my Father, and He shall presently give me more than \ntwelve legions of angels? But how then shall the scriptures be \nfulfilled, that thus it must be?\"t He conquered by love. If the \nordinary man is slapped, the great desire is to slap back. There-\nfore, God does not give His divine power to those who are spir-\nitually weak, because they would misuse it.

The caste \nand clan systems are almost as strong in America as in India. \nThe Negroes and American Indians are almost outcasts here, \nand the dark-skinned Sontals, Kohls, Vheels, and low castes are \noutcasts in India. India segregates them, calling them \"un-\ntouchables.\" In the South in America, Negroes have separate \nwaiting rooms in railroad stations, and they have to ride in dif-\nferent sections of the trolley cars and trains. As Negroes for the \nmost part perform menial labour and are social untouchables in \nAmerica, so the outcasts in India are servants and social un-\ntouchables there. In Washington, D.C., the national capital, I \nhad to conduct separate classes for my Negro and my Caucasian \nbrethren.

Instead of crit-\nicizing him, even his deadliest enemies admit that Gandhi is \nsincere and that he cannot be bribed by money, flattery, conces-\nsions, or political fame. He never compromises his principles. \nResisting Evil by Love \nGandhi's doctrine of resisting evil by the force of love has \nalready proven to be practical.

But this last time he was \nput in prison, he said: \"The movement must go on,\" and ever \nsince, thousands of India's most renowned men have courted \njail [through nonviolent noncooperation] in the cause of free-\ndom.

He believes in sponta-\nneous renunciation and selfless giving from the heart. He tries \nto unite people by cultivating brotherhood in their hearts. He \nis preaching love, so that all nations may help one another \neven as loving, prosperous brothers help a distressed brother. \nGandhi's greatest triumphs came when his weaponless army, \nhis spiritual battalion, resisted government orders not to make \nsalt and not to assemble. Eyewitnesses have described how the \npolice, armed with sticks and machine guns, charged the people; \nhow brave men fell with shattered skulls and wounded bodies, \nand how they stood up again saying, \"Kill us, but we will not \nmove.\" On many occasions the police fled, leaving their instru-\nments of war, tired of killing their unarmed brothers. Gandhi has \ngained the armistice, and a promise of self-government has been \nurged upon England. By resisting with spiritual force, Gandhi has \naccomplished more for India in three years than Ireland was able \nto accomplish in seven hundred years by using violence. \nI believe that the way to end war will be demonstrated \nwhen India attains her goal without beating or killing English \npeople.

First, consider the kind and quantity of food you eat. \nOvereating and wrong eating are dangerous to the development \nof magnetism because of their adverse effects on the vital forces \nin the body. Those who overload their systems with meat, for \nexample, diminish their magnetism. This is also true of other \nfoods not suited to the body. On the other hand, pure foods such \nas fresh fruits increase magnetism. As to the quantity of food \ningested, it should be just enough that when you leave the table \nyou are still a little hungry. Don't fill yourself to the gills. Over-\nloading the stomach drains the inner life force and causes a loss \nof magnetism. Those who consistently overeat are not magnetic, \nwhereas those who fast regularly increase their magnetism. \nYour body should be always under your control; it shouldn't \ncontrol you. Those who don't fast usually fear that if they go \nwithout food for even one day they are surely going to die. Yet \nwhen you are on a long fast, you find after a time that your \nhunger is gone and you lose all desire for food. Unless you know \nhow, it is dangerous to fast for a long period; but when you know \nwhat you are doing, it is all right.* The body's vital forces are \nenslaved by overeating, but by regular fasting, for one to three \ndays at a time, they become revitalized, increasing the body's \nmagnetism. \nYou, the soul, are far more than the perishable body of \nflesh. In fasting you discover that it is the cosmic energy, or \npiana, in the body that actually sustains you. This intelligent \nenergy, which has become dependent on food, learns to depend \nmore on itself. By fasting, you train the body to rely more on \ncosmic energy. Jesus pointed this out when he said: \"Man shall \nnot live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out \nof the mouth of God.\"t The \"mouth of God\" is the subtle cen-\ntre in the medulla through which divine life energy, the \"word,\" \nflows into the body from its cosmic source. \nDuring a fast, hold to the consciousness that you are not \n* Those who are inexperienced should seek medical guidance before under-\ntaking a long fast, \nt Matthew 4:4. \n"}

Will it digest the meal and become full of energy again? \nNo. It will remain lifeless. But if you put food in the stomach of \na living man, what happens? It will be digested.

In this connection I remember one great lesson that my \nGuru taught me. In his ashram there was a boy named Kumar, \nwho was very jealous of me because the others sought me out, \nand because Master had placed me in charge of the ashram du-\nties. One day Master said to me, without explanation, \"You go \nback to the sweeping from today. I am placing Kumar in charge.\" \nI said, \"All right, Master.\" I didn't get angry. I accepted it, for I \nhad faith in Master's great wisdom. \nThis boy then began to tyrannize over me, among other \nthings, asking me to shine his shoes! I did so. But even though \nhe was in charge, the other boys still kept coming to me and \nnot to him. One day I overheard Kumar complain to Master \nthat I was undermining his authority because the ashram devo-\ntees still came to me and not to him. Master replied with firm-\nness: \"That is what I wanted you to learn. He does his work \nwithout complaining and with the right attitude. Even though \nhe was put in the lowest position, his servicefulness and right \nbehaviour make him a natural leader,- and you see, because you \nhave not learned how to behave, you cannot lead others, even \nthough you were placed in charge.\" Master relieved him of his \nposition and gave it back to me. \nDon't be filled with ego. Take the back seat. That will make \nyou magnetic. So long as the ego will be bobbing inside you, God \nwill never be there. He stays away. To the egotist He says, \"You \nare but a little spark and yet you extol yourself so much. I own \nthe whole universe, but I remain silent, in the background.\" \nWhen you are with God, you have everything. The mil-\nlionaire, the billionaire, cannot make you bow down.

I \nused to sing my songs of devotion to God, and some in my fam-\nily lamented that I had gone wrong. Whenever I sang, they used \nto hide themselves in sorrow for me. But in time I convinced \nthem that they were mistaken. Then they also began singing \nmy songs of love for God and trying to meditate. They became \nmy students, right in my own home.

It shall burn there, and in its fire you shall find the \ngreat magnetism of Spirit that draws others unto you, and at-\ntracts whatsoever you truly need or desire. \nI tell you truthfully that all my questions have been an-\nswered, not through man but through God.

You think you \nwant human love and prosperity, but behind these it is your \nFather who is calling you. If you realize He is greater than all \nHis gifts, you will find Him. \nIn the science of yoga meditation India has given the an-\nswer to how to find Him. I travelled through that land. I sat at \nthe feet of a true master. I am not only convinced that God is, \nbut I give you my testimony of His presence. If you heed my \nwords, from your own realization you too shall someday say \nthat God is. You shall know I tell you the truth. \nEvery blade of grass, every spark of fire, every thought you \nthink testifies to His presence, His intelligence. He is the Source \nwhence all things come, but you are not conscious of Him. India \nspecialized in the science of going to that Source. \n"}

From what I have discerned, you will understand why \nhumanity can be called \"psychological furniture.\" This concept \ncame to me years ago in India, as a result of my experience with \na very learned professor who was head of a scientific association. \nThe professor's flaw was that he loved flattery—so much so, \nthat he wanted others always to agree with him, regardless of \ntheir own opinion. The first thing he expected was that we bow \ndown to him and touch his feet. I did it sincerely, however, be-\ncause I had a high regard for his learning. Studying with the pro-\nfessor were two young men who were trying to get a scholarship \nto a university in Japan through his recommendation. One of \nthem had very high qualifications, but he would not bow down \nto the professor. As a result, the professor denied him the schol-\narship, but approved it for the other, less-qualified student, who \nhad prudently flattered him. So the scholarship was won not so \nmuch on merit as on that student's awareness of the set charac-\nteristics of the professor, and of how to make use of that partic-\nular type of psychological furniture to serve his own purpose. \nFirst, we should understand the significance of the expres-\nsion, \"psychological furniture.\" When we think of the different \nfurnishings in a home—rocking chairs, tables, cabinets, and so \nforth—we see them as distinctive objects, solid and unchanging, \neach with its own definite uses and typical characteristics. The \nwood for each one was gathered, cut, chiselled, and polished in \norder to create that particular piece. Furniture comes in various \nstyles—Spanish, early American, French, and so on. We have an-\ntique furniture. There is also today's ultra-modern style (and in \nsome homes it looks good). The design of a piece of furniture \n142 \n"}

When you go into a home, you \ncan tell a lot about the owners by their furniture. You can rec-\nognize people of good taste by the way they furnish their houses. \nIt isn't necessarily the money they have put into it, but the taste \nwith which they have selected and arranged everything, that \nmakes their places attractive. The right furnishings can make a \nhome inviting, beautiful, and comfortable. So furniture is more \nthan inert objects. It is \"living\" in the sense that each piece has \nits distinctive purpose and personality. \nWe human beings are a lot like furniture, as I will show \nyou. Even as a wide variety of furniture is made from one ma-\nterial, wood, so are all humans made of the same stuff. When \nwe were first conceived in the mother's body, we were just one \nlittle cell. But in four days a complete design of what we were \nto become was present in that embryo. Some intelligent force \ncomposed a definite individual pattern—different from all oth-\ners—of what we were destined to be. \nMost newborn babies look very much alike. Of course, \nyou can tell a Chinese or an Indian baby from an American \nbaby, but for the most part there is very little difference in their \nappearance at birth. However, as the baby begins to grow, the \nunique pattern of what he is to become slowly unfolds. \nWhen the furniture-maker begins his work, he has a partic-\nular pattern in his mind, a chair, for example, which gradually \ntakes shape as he carves the wood. In the same way, out of the \nfirst tiny cell of a baby's body a predetermined pattern starts to \nemerge. That form continues to develop after birth until each \nindividual, each soul, shows the distinctive physical and mental \ncharacteristics that uniquely identify that human being—just as \nthe chair was shaped in a certain way from a formless log. \nWhat Instruments Mold Us Into Psychological Furniture? \nWhat are the instruments that create this bewildering va-\nriety of human psychological furniture? There is the influence \nof heredity and of the family,- and more importantly, the influ-\nence of our karma, the effects of our actions of past lives. God \nmade us in His image, but we chose to make ourselves into \nthese individualistic pieces of psychological furniture. We fash-\nioned our present bodies and minds by our thoughts, actions, \n"}

It makes no difference whether we be-\nlieve in karma and reincarnation or not. The law of cause and \neffect operates with or without our sanction. You have proba-\nbly wondered why the same parents can give birth to one child \nof keen intelligence and another who is mentally deficient. If \nboth infants were created in the image of God, and God is just, \nhow could this be? Such enigmas are explained by the karmic \nlaw of cause and effect at work in each human life. It is not the \nchisel of heredity alone that shapes an individual into a partic-\nular piece of psychological furniture; his past-life actions cre-\nate their own good or bad effects in this life. It is karma that \nsets the pattern from which the instruments of present-life \ninfluences work and shape us as we are today. \nSo, heredity and family, the effects and influences of our \nenvironment, climatic conditions, our free-will responses to \nkarmic conditions brought on from the past, and the civiliza-\ntion or era in which we are born—all of these serve to mould \nour bodies and our mentalities.

You can easily spot him: He says, \n\"Okay,\" and \"Go ahead,\" and is definitely American in his \ndress and behaviour. \nEvery kind of furniture has a use, unless it is ready to crum-\nble. Even then it has value if some worthwhile memory or ideal \nis associated with it, as with the chair on which Lincoln sat. \nSimilarly, the different kinds of psychological furniture pro-\nduced by different nations all have their own special value and \nusefulness. \nHuman Peculiarities \nThis concept of human beings as different types of furniture \nis very amusing, isn't it?

We \ncould not remember names, or how to walk, or how to do the \nsimplest task.

Without memory we would remain \nlike children. \nThe word \"remember\" comes from re, \"again,\" and mem-\noraii, \"to be mindful of.\" Memory is the original mental note \nmade of every thought, act, or experience when it first occurs. \nEach memory is recorded in the brain as a particular thought \npattern. To remember is to recall to conscious awareness any \none of these countless records. \nAll our experiences of past incarnations, as well as those \nsince birth in this life, are present in our subconscious mind. Yet \nmost people do not remember past lives—who they were and \nwhere, and what they did—or much from the early years of this \nlife. But you can easily recall even minute details of your im-\nmediate past, such as what food you had yesterday, and where \nyou ate it. A similar total recall of all your myriad experiences \nin this life and in previous lives would so crowd your conscious \nmind that you would have no peace. Fortunately, memory is \nselective, enabling you to remember the salient features of your \nexperiences without having to relive them in complete detail \nwhenever you think of them.

To illustrate: You are aware of every part of your body \nwithout \"remembering\" or reproducing that awareness in your \nconsciousness. You do not have to recall the fact that you have \na body; you know it, because your consciousness is awake \nthroughout your body. Similarly, on a grand scale, God is in \neverything, and everything is in Him. He has no memory; He \nhas no need for memory, because He is omnipresent in all past, \npresent, and future experiences. In His eternal conscious \nawareness He has nothing \"past\" to remember. In my own ex-\nperience, I find mortal memory fading away; the divine con-\nsciousness of my eternal omnipresent soul-nature has become \npredominant. In this consciousness all knowledge and percep-\ntion comes to me, not through mental processes or memory, \nbut as intuitive experiences. \nMemory reproduces in the consciousness those experiences \nthat are past and forgotten. We do not need memory for that \nwhich is happening in the now. Here in this temple, as we con-\nsciously look around us, we are aware of the windows and drapes \nand other details of the room. But to \"see\" similarly any other \npart of the temple, we must turn to memory to reproduce what-\never we have previously observed there. \nLimiting Effect of Man's Mortal Nature \nBecause of the predominance of his mortal nature, man is \ncut off from the universal consciousness and the full potential \nof his human brain. * He remains unaware of his divine intu-\nitive consciousness and has to rely on his all-too-poorly devel-\noped faculty of memory, which cannot even recall all the early \nexperiences of this life, much less past ones. He may remem-\nber his childhood home and a few outstanding experiences of \nthat time, but most of what happened then has been forgotten. \n* \"It is conservatively estimated that the human brain can store an amount of \ninformation equivalent to an astounding 100 trillion different words. This \nwould mean acquiring one word per second continuously for a million years. \nOf course, no one ever uses more than a fraction of this storage space. In a life-\ntime of 70 years a human being may store information roughly equivalent to \na mere trillion words\" (Gordon Graff, \"Chemical Memory for Instant Learn-\ning,\" Science Digest, September 1973). \n"}

If you feel a deep re-\nsentment toward some person, and every day you recall that \nfeeling and retaliate by mentally striking him, it will take you \nincarnations to erase the remembrance of that hatred. To be-\ncome the victim of a memory filled with ugly recollections is \ndangerous. Cultivate forgetfulness of past wrongs and vengeful \nfeelings, and encourage only the remembrance of good. \nFew people in this world try consciously to develop the \npotentials of body, mind, and soul. The rest are victims of cir-\ncumstances of the past. They plod on and on, pushed by past \nwrong habits, helplessly going down under their influence, re-\nmembering only: \"I am a nervous man,\" or \"I am a weakling,\" \nor \"I am a sinner,\" and so on. \nIt lies with each one of us to cut with the sword of wisdom \nthe cords of our bondage, or to remain bound. \nGod has given everyone freedom to act as he will.

In the \nawakened memory of Him lies the key to freedom. \nUse your memory to recall what you are—an immortal \nsoul—and forget the evil memory of mortality. This is why \nSelf-Realization [Yogoda Satsanga] teaches you to constantly \nremember the truth: you are Spirit.

An excess of fat in the diet impairs digestion and ul-\ntimately affects memory. Fried and fatty foods may be eaten \nonce in a while, but only in moderation. Strictly avoid pork or \npork products. Memory can be ruined by their excessive use. \nPerhaps you are thinking, \"I eat pork products, but I still have \na good memory.\" My response is that you have brought that \ngood memory from the past. Continued regular consumption \nof pork will undo it. \nCold showers are beneficial to the memory and to the \nnerves. Cooling the nerves helps to promote mental calmness. \nA calm mind becomes an instrument for reproducing experi-\nences clearly. \nTo be overactive sexually is detrimental to memory, drain-\ning its power more than any other factor. Those who have self-\ncontrol can develop tremendous power of memory, tremendous \npower of mind.

It is helpful, also, to add and \nsubtract figures mentally. Unfortunately, many people never \nexercise their memory in these ways. \nAnother method for developing the power of memory is to \ngently tap the top of the head with the knuckles. \nLearn to do everything with deep attention and concentra-\ntion, but do not be like those people who apply such concen-\ntration that they become overly fastidious, nagging and fussing \nabout unimportant details.

It is God who is the sole creator of everything, and it is \nHe who works through His physical, mental, and spiritual laws. \nI also know of ways to use simple herbs that are very effec-\ntive in healing the body. So there are various methods of healing \nin this world, and the quarrel between the mental and physical \nhealers is unnecessary. Tremendous healings are being accom-\nplished in the field of medical science. Its scientists do not claim \nto have found all the laws of healing, but they have developed \nantibiotics and vaccines and other treatments that are curing and \neradicating many diseases. They are on the verge of discovering \na ray that will destroy some types of cancer cells. We must give \ncredit to medical science. Doctors understand the mechanism of \nthe human body better than the ordinary layman does. \nOn the other hand, do not depend solely on pills, but learn \nto rely more on the power of the mind. It is ignorance to deny \nthe effect of material things on the body,- and it is false reason-\ning not to recognize and develop the power of the mind. If you \ndepend too much on material methods, the mind will not work. \nIt is better to learn how to use the superior power of the mind. \nBut if you don't know how to operate that mind, the sane view \n* Many examples of how Lahiri Mahasaya healed people in this way are de-\nscribed in Autobiography of a Yogi. \n"}

In order to cure that dream \nbite you had to take some dream medicine. But in the dream-\nland, what was the difference between the bite, the pain, the \nmedicine, and the garden? Nothing. They were only different \nthoughts. But your imagination gave them such strength that \nwhen you were bitten by a dream snake, you felt a dream pain. \nAnd when you took a dream medicine, you felt a dream relief \nfrom that pain. \nSimilarly, you are dreaming this finite world and this phys-\nical body, and you have to admit the relative reality of all things \nthat are happening. You cannot say that everything is a delusion \nand be unaffected by that delusion while you are dreaming this \ncosmic dream. The body does exist in this dream of creation, \nand so long as you are in the body, you have to admit its exis-\ntence. You cannot say that matter is not real. It is real, in the \nrelative sense. If it were not so, one could drink poison and not \nbe affected by it. But for the ordinary man who takes poison, the \nresult is death. It is folly for him to believe that matter has no \nreality. He is in delusion to say so. \nA man on the East Coast told me of a woman who boasted \nto him about her superior conviction of the unreality of matter. \n\"This fire is a delusion,\" she said. \"It can't hurt me.\" He said \nnothing. But one day he saw his opportunity. When she wasn't \nlooking, he warmed the poker in the fireplace and touched it to \nher back. She cried out, \"Ow! Why did you do that?\" He an-\nswered calmly, \"Well, fire is a delusion. Your body is a delusion. \nThe pain is a delusion. So how could I hurt you with a hot \npoker?\" She was very angry. But he proved his point, that so long \nas you are in the delusion, you cannot say that matter is not real. \nWhen you have a pain in the body, it is very hard to real-\nize that the body is a delusion. So we must not be fanatics. We \nmust proceed moderately, and gradually develop our will power \nand the power of the mind until we come to that state where \nwe actually perceive that everything in this world is the dream-\nthought of God. \nMind Works if You Know How to Control It \nThe mind is a very strange thing.

If you want to see how the mind works, you must bring \nit under your control. Without a controlled mind, you can't re-\nalize anything of what I am telling you. This requires gradual \ndevelopment. Mind power is not a simple matter. It works very \nsubtly. To understand its subtlety is to know its power. Mind \nworks in everything. If you know the secret of the workings of \nthe mind, you will find this to be true. \nOnce a student in my classes in Minneapolis asked for \nhelp. She had been in a car accident. Her hand was all crippled, \nwith a growth on it, and the thumb was sticking straight out. \nShe couldn't bend it. The doctors had not been able to help her. \nRight before the whole audience I took her hand and pulled the \nthumb. It became free; she could move it. Her hand was healed. \nThe following day, in gratitude, she gave a large donation to \nthis work to help carry it on. So you see, mind power does \nwork; but there must also be faith—as she had faith. \nIt is not God's desire that the mental scientist and the phys-\nical scientist should fight. Both are dealing with laws of God. \nThe body is nothing but mind in action. There is no difference \nbetween the body and the mind except in their manifestations. \nThe body is a grosser manifestation and the mind is a finer man-\nifestation. In its elemental form, H20 is invisible. Condensed, \nthese gases become water, a liquid. When water is frozen, it be-\ncomes ice, a solid. However, the invisible H20, the water, and \nthe solid ice are essentially not different. And as H20 can appear \nas water and ice, so mind can appear as life and body—electri-\ncal or \"fluid\" life, and the \"solid\" physical body. Mind* is the \ninvisible man or soul; life or piana is \"liquid\" mind; and the \nbody is gross or \"solid\" mind. A simple philosophy, but a real-\nization very hard to attain. \nWith the power of your mind you can work changes in the \nlife in the body as well as in the body itself. Who but your mind \n* In the context of this talk, the word \"mind\" is used in a broad sense, mean-\ning the consciousness in man: the soul, and its inherent powers of intelligence, \nwill, and feeling. When differentiated, the term \"mind\" (Sanskrit, manas) has \na limited connotation of sense-consciousness—like a mirror, it receives and \nreflects the impressions from the senses, which are then interpreted by the in-\ntelligence, reacted to by the feeling, and responded to by the will. \n"}

By healthful stimulation of the \nbody you can make the mind feel better. By stimulation of the \nlife, you can make the mind and body feel better. They are all \ncorrelated. The physical affects the mental and the mental af-\nfects the physical because they are interrelated. Therefore, you \ncan affect the body through the mind, or the mind through the \nbody. Thus, many people think they have to have a drink in or-\nder to feel happy—again, interrelation between the body and \nthe mind. But a thousand bottles of wine could not create the \nintoxicating joy that I can produce just by mind power—and \nwithout devastating side effects. \nMind can enable you to do anything you want, but you \nmust experiment first in little things until you fully develop \nthat power. If you don't constantly work at developing mind \npower, don't try suddenly to depend wholly on it. Never dis-\ncredit the effects of the mind on the body, but remember that \nyou have to gradually train the mind until you know that its \npower works. People who take medicines all the time become \ndependent on medicine and doctors. And those who are fanat-\nical and refuse medical help when they need it often do great \ninjury to themselves. You will not be forgiven for your igno-\nrance of God's laws; you will have to suffer the consequences. \nYou must use common sense. \nTo know and use little remedies such as putting iodine on a \nfinger when it is cut is all right. What is the sense of risking in-\nfection by saying that mind will heal it? When you break your \nfinger, does your mind straighten it out? Common sense tells you \nto have it set properly so that it will grow straight again. In either \ncase, it is the mind that ultimately heals; commonsense remedies \nmerely cooperate with and support the laws that promote the \nhealing process when mind power is not yet perfectly developed. \nMind Can Produce Negative as Well as Positive Results \nMind is very tricky,- it can produce negative as well as pos-\nitive results. I remember one time when my sister had a sore \nthroat. I never saw such a terrible infection. She couldn't eat; \nshe couldn't swallow anything.

She was unaware of my \nhand on her throat as I sent the power of my thought there. But \nthe first thing she knew, she was eating, and didn't feel any \npain. She was so happy that her throat was healed. \nAfter I left, she got up and looked at her throat in a mirror. \nWhen she saw the ulcers still there, the pain returned and she \nlet out a shriek. \nWhen I came again to the house and saw her suffering, I \nasked, \"What did you do?\" \n\"I looked at my throat,\" she answered. \nI said, \"I saw your throat perfect in the light of God, and \nthat is why you were well. But you saw the disease, and that is \nwhy you are feeling pain.\" Then I told her, \"Drink this water.\" \nBecause her mind was receptive, she was able to swallow the \nwater, and was quite all right once more. She didn't look at her \nthroat again. \nSo you see, mind has a great deal to do with it. In nervous \ndiseases—which are nurtured by wrong thoughts—the mind can \npromote healing very fast, when its power is correctly applied. \nOn another occasion, the wife of a very dear friend in Long \nBeach came to see me.

I asked for some milk to be brought. \n\"Now drink it!\" I said firmly. \nBecause of the limiting thoughts in her mind, put there by \nthe doctors and her past experiences, she was convinced that \nshe couldn't drink. But my thought was stronger. After all, the \nnerves and cells are all controlled by the mind. But hers was so \npoisoned with doubt that she firmly believed she couldn't swal-\nlow. So the first gulps of milk were expelled from her mouth. \nShe was sure that I was wrong. \nThen I said, \"I mean it; you cannot leave this room until \nyou have finished that glass of milk.\" \n"}

She was cured. \nMan Is Kept Hypnotized With Delusion \nYou see, this world is a world of maya, delusion, and man \nis kept hypnotized with that delusion. Our mind has convinced \nus of so many limitations. Someone says, \"I must have my cof-\nfee.\" Another says, \"I must have my juicy piece of steak,\" and \nso on. It is a crazy world. I see it so clearly. But I follow the \nrules—as much as I want to, and then I say, \"Down with rules! \nIt is the mind that rules.\" And it works. \nDeath was such a reality, life was such a reality, but they are \nno more real for me. Never was I born, though in my dreams of \nearth life I was bom many times. And never have I died, though \nmany times I dreamed the death of my body in this dream world. \nIn this one incarnation I can sleep and dream that I am bom in \nEngland as a powerful king. Then I die and dream I am bom a de-\nvout man. And then I die again and am born as a successful \nlawyer. Again I die and am rebom as Yogananda. But they are all \ndreams. That is what I am saying. I used to find such pleasure in \ndiscovering my past incarnations. But that has lost its enchant-\nment. They are just so many dreams. When I realized everything \nis mind stuff, and that it is God's thought which is creating all \nthese things, all these dreams all the time, then it had a differ-\nent meaning for me. God can dissolve these dreams any time and \nbring them back again in better forms. But nothing is erased \nfrom the Infinite Mind; every dream is eternally imprinted there. \nDelusion is so strong that it is pretty hard to believe it is \ndelusion when you have needs and no money to meet them. It \nis difficult to believe that this world is maya when you are sick \nand suffering. But when you constantly keep your mind in God, \nyou will realize that this world is His dream. \nThis is why in India we don't pay as much attention to \nphysical healing as to the healing of the soul's ignorance. To \nheal the soul of ignorance—that is, to remove the delusion that \ncovers the soul—is the greatest of all healings, because that \nhealing is lasting. And when you heal the soul, then you realize \nthe body is nothing but a dream shell in which the soul resides. \n"}

But the next day at three o'clock in the afternoon \nit came back. And every day thereafter, around the same time, \nher fever returned. One day he came and said, \"Master, her \nfever has not left. Please, please do something.\" \nI replied, \"God alone will heal her.\" \nHe pleaded, \"If once you come, she will be well.\" \nI relented.

If you want to lose weight or avoid \ngaining it, there are a few important points to remember. One \nis: never drink water, milk, or other liquids with your meals. It \nis best to take fluids a half-hour before a meal or two hours \nafterward. When your body weight increases, the cells become \nvery hungry for water. It is strange that sometimes the strongest \nurges we have are for those very things that hurt us. Drinking \nplenty of water and fruit juices helps to keep the body free from \ndisease; just don't drink them with your meals. \nTake a glass of milk in between meals; it will help to keep \nyour body healthy, because milk supplies your body with all \nthe elements that are necessary. But avoid the cream in it— \ntake skim milk. \nAnother important point is to eat plenty of fresh fruits and \nvegetables, preferably raw. Cut out sugar and starches and fried \nfoods. It is all right if you eat these once in a while, but it should \nnot be an everyday habit. Remember, too much starch in the \ndiet is very unhealthful, as well as fattening. When you are hun-\ngry for sweets or a snack, the best thing to eat is fruit. For extra \nnourishment, put on it a dressing of finely ground nuts mixed \nwith fruit juice or some other base. \nYour body needs protein, but too much protein is danger-\nous to your physical being. Don't make a habit of eating meat \nprotein, because it will create poisons in your system. One \nmore important rule is to avoid fats; however, a little olive oil \nevery day will help keep the joints healthy. \nIn general, follow a moderate diet that contains all the \nelements the body requires, and eat only as much as the body \nactually needs. That is the way to stabilize the weight by \nproper eating. If you overeat, the sad fact is that ladies will get \nfat in back and gentlemen will get fat in front. So eat less, and \nget plenty of exercise to keep the muscles well toned. Never let \nthe abdominal muscles get weak. It is always a good practice \nto hold the abdominal muscles in. \nWhen trying to lose weight, don't be overanxious. There is \ndanger in using drastic means to get rid of fat in a hurry. \nExcess weight is hard on the whole system—from the feet \nto the heart. For every pound of flesh there is a mile of blood \n"}

In the absence of any other cause, it is often assumed that \npersons who have abundant energy must have been born strong; \nand that those who suffer from fatigue must have been born \nweak. There is some truth in this theory, that our normal en-\nergy level is the result of hereditary or congenital causes that \nhave trailed us since birth. But when we begin to understand the \ntotal being that is man, we realize that he is no simple physical \norganism. Within him are many powers whose potential he em-\nploys in greater or lesser degree in accommodating himself to \nthe conditions of this world. Their potential is vastly greater \nthan the average person thinks. \nMan learns to work with whatever energy is at his com-\nmand, usually without understanding whence it comes. He only \nknows that when he becomes fatigued he wants to rest or to \nhave something to eat or drink, because these measures give him \nsome relief. It is generally true that a tired person feels better af-\nter eating or resting; but as the body grows older, a time comes \nwhen no amount of food or rest restores strength. Clearly, some-\nthing happens to the body that causes the material sources of life \nto fail us. Hence we should analyse and understand the physiol-\nogy of the body, that we may know how it recuperates, and from \nwhat sources it derives energy and strength. \nThe most commonly thought of source of bodily energy is \nfood, which consists of solids and liquids. When they are taken \ninto the stomach, the bodily machine breaks them down into \nsimpler chemical substances, and finally into energy. Solids \ncan be converted into liquids, liquids into gas, and gas into en-\nergy. Therefore all food, whether solid or liquid, is essentially \nenergy. Fatigue means that too much bodily energy has been \n181 \n"}

Man cannot bring forth even a grain of wheat, much less \na new plant or fruit. Only God can do this. He has to originate \nthe species first. Man can only modify what already exists, as \nLuther Burbank did. \nCultivated Tastes Versus Natural Hunger Instincts \nGod also gave man water, in the mountain spring; and milk \nto nourish him, in the cow and in the human mother. From the \nmoment of birth man instinctively seeks these natural sources of \nsustenance. The impulse of hunger stirs the impulse to eat. Had \nGod not given us the hunger-impulse, we would not eat at all. \nMan unwisely perverts his natural hunger and sense of taste \nthrough misuse. The theory that hunger is the result of the habit \nof eating is true, at least, of the greedy person. Greed is a men-\ntal hunger. If one lives naturally, he has no desire to eat more \nthan a normal diet, and his taste preferences are also normal. \nThe abnormal appetite created by greed kills untold numbers of \nmen and women. During the era of the Roman Empire great \nfeasts were indulged in by the wealthy. A special room was pro-\nvided where, after eating, they could go to vomit so that they \ncould continue their feasting. Such is the debasement of greed! \nWe see all kinds of eccentricities in man whenever he be-\ncomes a criminal against his own welfare through misuse of the \nsenses. When man forgets the purpose of an action and clings \nrather to the action by which the end is to be accomplished, he \nmakes a grave mistake. Hunger and taste were given to man to \nhelp him select the proper quantity and right type of food to sus-\ntain his body in a healthful way; but wrong habits of living and \neating have distorted this natural dietary instinct, creating pref-\nerences that are not always best for him. Something that tastes \ngood and fills the stomach doesn't necessarily satisfy bodily \nneeds.

Many vitamins are destroyed by the \nheat of the cooking and canning process. Hence a diet in which \nsuch foods predominate is not sufficiently nourishing to fill the \nneeds of the body. \nThe stomach and digestive tract distill the chemicals from \nour food and distribute them to the proper types of cells through-\nout the system. The body is composed of various chemical ele-\nments, and you should see that your diet replenishes these ele-\nments every day. A good diet should contribute as many of the \nnecessary elements as possible at every meal. Eat sufficient pro-\ntein, many vitamins and minerals, some fats and oils, and some \nnatural carbohydrates (but few refined starches and sugars). \nFresh Fruits and Vegetables Vital to Health \nMeat protein is not the only vital source of energy. Some \nof the mineral salts that are found in fresh uncooked vegetables \nand fruits are important sources also. A large serving of steak \nwill give plenty of energy, it is true, but a preponderance of \nmeat in the diet, if continued for a long period of time, ceases \nto give strength. Overmuch heavy protein results in protein \npoisoning, a cause of fatigue and also disease. Too much pro-\ntein is just as harmful as too little. \nIf you want to be rid of fatigue, then one remedy is to eat \nproperly. Remember that meat may give strength temporarily, \nbut it loads the body with poisons. By eating more raw foods \nyou will have less cause for fatigue, and therefore an abundance \nof energy. Whenever the body feels tired, drink a glass of pine-\napple or orange juice,- it will give you much energy. Whole fruits \nand vegetables are even more nutritious than their juices, but \nmost people won't take the time to consume them this way. An \nexcellent energy provider is orange juice with finely ground \nalmonds mixed in. Nuts are more readily assimilated in com-\nbination with orange juice. \nRemember, it is important to drink an abundance of liq-\nuids. When good water is unavailable, fresh fruit juices, co-\nconut water, and watermelon provide an excellent supplement \nand partial substitute. In the future, more and more people will \ndrink fruit and vegetable juices, to their benefit. \nDo not forget to include some butter and milk in your diet. \n"}

Many persons af-\nflicted with these troubles have found great improvement by \nomitting regular intake of orange juice from their diet, upon \nmy advice.

Although persons with a tendency \ntoward phlegm should generally avoid starches, whole wheat \nbread may be taken, if thoroughly toasted. \nConstipation is another cause of fatigue, which is related \nto the accumulation of poisons in the body as well as to the \nenergy from food. If you are constipated, use some kind of lax-\native, preferably a natural one. If you keep your body free from \npoisons you will not be fatigued.

Sleep \nten hours and you will feel depleted of energy. You won't want \nto work the rest of the day; you will just drag yourself around. \nFatigue can also be removed by oxygenation.

As you begin to draw energy \nfrom the Infinite, you will require less food as well as less sleep. \nYou will begin to rise completely above the need for material \nmethods of sustenance. You need not be limited by material \nlaws. The magic method of working without fatigue lies in the \nuse of your will power. When you can draw energy from the cos-\nmic source, you can eat breakfast or go without, and it won't \nmake any difference; you won't feel any lack. You will be above \nthat consciousness. \nLove Is One of the Greatest Stimulants to the Will \nWhatever I do, I do with the greatest love that I have in \nme. Try this, and you will see that you do not become fatigued \nat all. Love is one of the greatest stimulants to the will. Under \nthe influence of love the will can do almost anything. You can \ndemonstrate this in your life if you depend more on will power. \nYour body will not need eight hours of rest; you will find that \nsix hours of sleep will be plenty, along with one balanced meal \na day, and perhaps fruit juice now and then. You will remain \nalways well. Through God's grace I feel the same—and I think \nI look almost the same!—as I have throughout these nineteen \nyears that I have been in this country.

If \nyou swallow poison, your action produces the evil fruit of death. \nIf you eat wholesome food, your action yields the good fruit of \nbetter health. Today I am speaking primarily of evil karma: that \nwhich brings pain and suffering. If we are made in God's image, \nas the scriptures tell us, and God is free from karmic suffering, \nwhy aren't we also free? \nEvil karma is the result of misuse of our God-given power of \nfree choice. Animals are free from individual karma. They can do \nno evil because they have no power of discrimination. Their lives \nare governed by instinct and by mass karma, the effects of their \nenvironment. Although sexually indiscriminate, they are not \npunished for it, since their behavior is not self-determined but \ninstinct-bound. So animals don't suffer from the effects of their \nactions as human beings do. Man has the gift of reason by which \nto choose all his actions, and is thus accountable for them. \nThen the question is, \"Why is God eternally free from the \nfruits of actions, and we are not?\" Let us go deep into the sub-\nject and you will understand it as never before. \nGod is spoken of as eternal existence, eternal conscious-\nness, eternal bliss. As such, He has never suffered. Why then \ndid He conceive suffering for us? Isn't that strange? I know the \nanswer, but still I argue with Him: \"Lord if You wanted to cre-\nate this little play world, why did You have to make suffering \na part of it? What is play to You is death to us.

I am the greatest optimist. Optimism doesn't mean \nbeing happy so long as everything goes well, but when pain \ncomes, turning gloomy and saying, \"God, You are terrible.\" God \nhad nothing to do with our present state of misery. When He \ncreated us, He gave us freedom to suffer or to rise above it. Op-\ntimism means being able to laugh at both pleasure and pain— \nto mentally get away from the hurtful effects of duality. \nPain Has Three Causes \nPain is the greatest curse of the soul. For those who are suf-\nfering, it is dreadful. Even if you are all right now, how do you \nknow that you won't some day be a victim? So long as there is \nany possibility of suffering, you must try to remove its causes \nby the roots. \nThere are three factors behind man's sufferings: first comes \ndelusion,- second, the effects of man's own wrong actions; and \nthird, the effects of mass karma, such as the destruction of \nboth good and evil individuals when Hiroshima was bombed. \nDelusion causes identification with the flesh. From the be-\nginning of life, the child thinks of his body as himself, that he \nand the body are one. This is why he cries if you pinch him, \nand why he likes it when you soothe his hand. The delusion of \nidentification with the body came with the creation of man, \nand that identification increases by pampering the body. \nIn India our training is different than here in the West. We \nare taught to conquer the flesh, to mentally rise above body \nconsciousness. If you love the body too much, you become un-\nduly sensitive; you suffer whenever the body is uncomfortable. \nYou have been taught to suffer, because you have been taught \nto depend too much on physical comfort for happiness. The de-\nsire for all sorts of comforts is a major source of pain. This is \nwhy the saints say we should not be attached to anything.

Animals suffer much less \nthan man because they are not egoistically identified with the \nbody. They cannot relate to an ego as humans do. We also re-\nlate to others according to the degree of our identification with \nthem. Seeing a stranger with a broken leg, you say, \"How un-\nfortunate!\" You feel sympathy for him, but you are detached \nfrom the pain of his injury. If you had broken your own leg, you \nwould be suffering with the pain. In the same way, a mother \nwho sees her neighbour's child killed doesn't feel as sorrowful \nas she would if it were her own child. In each case, identifica-\ntion is the cause of suffering. You identify yourself more closely \nwith your own body than with someone else's; and you relate \nmore readily to those persons or things that are nearest and \ndearest to you than to those that are not personally close to you. \nThe Connection Between You and Bodily Pain Is Only Mental \nThe fact is, if you learn to live in your body without think-\ning of it as yourself, you won't suffer so much. The connection \nbetween you and bodily pain is only mental. When you are \nasleep and unconscious of the body, you feel no pain. Likewise, \nwhen a doctor or a dentist gives you an anaesthetic and per-\nforms surgery on your body, you don't feel any pain. The mind \nhas been disconnected from the sensation. On the other hand, \nby strongly picturing in your mind the suffering of another per-\nson, you can experience his pain in yourself. \nThe best anaesthesia against pain is your mental power. If \nyour mind refuses to accept it, pain will be greatly lessened. I \nhave seen, at times when this body got hurt and felt severe \npain, that if I put my mind at the Christ [Kutastha] centre— \nthat is, if I identify myself more with God and less with the \nbody—there is no pain at all. So when pain comes, concentrate \nat the Christ centre. Be mentally apart from pain,- develop more \nstrength of mind. Be tough within. When you are feeling pain, \ninwardly say to yourself, \"It doesn't hurt me.\" When a hurt \ncomes, recognize it as something to be cared for, but don't suf-\nfer over it. The more you concentrate on the power of the \nmind, the more your body consciousness drops away. And the \nmore you love the body and are overly solicitous of it, the more \nlimited the redeeming power of the mind will be. \n"}

Don't cry for me, ye who are left on this des-\nolate shore, still to mourn and deplore; it is I who pity you.\"* \nThere is no reason to dread death; pain is what we are afraid \nof. The pain of death itself is very little. But why didn't the Lord \ngive us the power to change our old worn-out body as we change \nour old clothes? Wouldn't you like to come out with a young \nbody when this one grows old or weak, without having to die \nand be born again? This is what some yogis do. Once in India a \nvery old yogi came to the cremation grounds. Upon a funeral \npyre was a young man's body, ready to be cremated. The old man \ncried out, \"Stop! I need that body.\" And even as he said it, the \nyoung man's form, enlivened by the spirit of the yogi, jumped up \nfrom the pyre and the saint's old body fell dead. Wearing his new \nphysical habitat, the yogi ran off and soon disappeared in the \ncrowd. The astonished mourners cremated his old body. \nOn a little island in the Bay of Bengal there lived a saint. \nOne day his devotees found him sitting on a pile of wood. He \nspoke wonderful truths to them. After he had finished his dis-\ncourse, they asked, \"Why are you sitting on the wood?\" \n\"To save you the trouble of cremating this body,\" he an-\nswered. \"I have stayed here long enough, and have decided to \ngive up this body now.\" \nAs he took a match and lit the pyre, he remarked, \"Lest \nyou think I am burning alive, please come and see for your-\nselves that this body is dead.\" \nAnd he consciously left his body. The devotees rushed for-\nward and found that his form was indeed lifeless. \nLahiri Mahasaya left his body in a similar manner: An-\nnouncing to a group of devotees assembled around him that he \nwas going, he lifted up his eyes and was gone. The saints say \nthis is how you must treat the body, as a temporary residence. \nDon't be attached to it or bound by it. Realize the infinite power \nof the light, the immortal consciousness of the soul, which is \nbehind this corpse of sensation. \nHow glorious is life after death!

On the inner side of \nmy consciousness, I am in that astral world all the time, so I \nknow. In comparison, this earth is a bedlam; in the astral world \nyou can order things according to your wish. In your astral \"car\" \nyou can travel any distance instantly. If you desire flowers, they \nare there immediately, just by willing them. And when you no \nlonger want them, remove the thought and they are gone. You \ndo these things subconsciously in dreams. You can do them even \non this physical plane, but you have to develop much greater \nmental power in order to create as God does. In the miracles he \nperformed, Jesus demonstrated he could do it. And he said: \"He \nthat believeth on me (the Christ Consciousness, or universal in-\ntelligence of God in all creation), the works that I do shall he do \nalso; and greater works than these shall he do.\"* \nSo remember, death is nothing to fear.

So it is with souls who die \nand awaken on the astral plane. They leave the physical movie \nscreen and reappear on the astral movie screen,- they never really \ndie. Many, many devotees who have died I have seen again. This \nis why I don't sorrow. When you know God, He shows you every-\nthing; and you will no longer miss anyone. Sometimes the astral \nform of a person will be sitting right by your side. You won't see \nhim, because you can't see an astral being with the two physical \neyes; but I can see him.

This is why the saints say, \"Pray unceasingly.\" \nWhen you continuously pray and meditate, you go into the \nland of superconsciousness, where no troubles can reach you. \nYou can be free from karma right now, by these methods. \nWhenever karmic troubles plague you, go to sleep. Or, think \npure thoughts and make the mind like steel, saying to yourself: \n\"I am above it all.\" Or, best of all, in deep meditation go into the \ndivine state of superconsciousness. The bliss of that conscious-\nness is the natural state of your soul, but you have forgotten your \nreal nature by being so long identified with the body. That un-\ntroubled, blissful state of the soul has to be reacquired. \nOrdinarily, you are free from consciousness of the body \nonly eight hours of the day. During the other sixteen, you make \nyourself miserable through your bondage to body conscious-\nness. By keeping your mind happy, and by not dwelling on your \ntroubles, you will suffer much less.

As an individualized self, the \nsoul has descended from the universality of Spirit and become \nidentified with the limitations of the body and its sense-\nconsciousness.

The indwelling soul is \nimmortal. Natural death is a blessing, because it offers the soul \nan opportunity to exchange a dilapidated, tottering dwelling-\nplace for a new and sturdy one. The soul requires the successive \ninstrumentalities of new and better organisms in order to ex-\npress itself fully. If the individualized soul, cloaked in delusion \nand sent out to evolve itself back to God, didn't have a chance \nto express itself—to assert its nature—through various chang-\ning bodies, it would have to remain in a nascent or latent dis-\nembodied state. And imagine, if the immortal soul had to live \nforever in an old bent body, pallid and shrunken! No greater \npunishment could be meted out to this great one, the soul, than \nto behold and express through the same decrepit organism for-\never. Instead, the inhabited organism undergoes the soul's dis-\ncipline, as the soul experiments with it; and when the soul's \nwork is finished on that particular form, it works on another. \nMatter is wrought with change; and the spirit within it, \nthough essentially unchangeable, superficially undergoes change \nby its subjective experience of that phenomenon. As subjective \nconsciousness of sameness of identity is retained from early \nchildhood to old age (except, perhaps, in the less perceptive ear-\nliest stages of infancy and the last stages of extreme old age), so \nalso there is no reason why that subjective consciousness cannot \n"}

With that continuity of \nconsciousness, death is seen truly as the soul's best friend, giving \nit infinite opportunities to wrestle with matter and finally over-\ncome it—even after a million defeats. This true friend teaches \nthe soul to manifest its unchangeable nature by transcending the \nconsciousness of change. \nThe human mind prefers change in environs, tastes, habits, \nand possessions, not because it cannot stick to one thing, but \nbecause it is constantly finding out that its attention has been \nmisplaced and misdirected. Its craving for something unknown \ndoes not remain satisfied with the acquisition of possessions of \nthe world of changing things. Through new opportunities af-\nforded by death and changing conditions, the soul is seeking its \ninnate changelessness, and so never feels satisfied until it ac-\nquires and becomes reestablished in its natural state of oneness \nwith Spirit. Hence death, or change of the condition in which \nthe soul temporarily resides, is conducive to the soul's growth \nand development. \nThe growth and education of life mean nothing more than \nthat the manifesting consciousness in matter evolves to ulti-\nmately express its full potential; thereafter to be sifted from mat-\nter in order to know and free itself as an independent entity that \ncan stay without the agency of matter. During the learning \nprocess, before the self-pushing diligent soul realizes its superior-\nity and transcendental nature, it is strongly attached to the bodily \ninstrument through the compelling sensory and egoistic ties cre-\nated during its residence in the body. Hence the soul watches its \nnew body in each new incarnation with the care and possessive-\nness of a man with a newly bought automobile. Consequently, \ndeath that is brought on prematurely by disease from unnatural \nliving or bad karma, or by so-called accidents and other misfor-\ntunes, involves mental and bodily pain, because the manifesting \nsoul becomes extremely worried when it sees its vehicle of \nexpression being taken away before the expiry of the natural term. \nThe Spiritual Psychology of Pain \nThe pain produced on a human organism by a pinprick is \nbeneficial; as a warning, it reports to the soul the punctured \ncondition of the skin, needing repair.

It is possible to know each bodily or mental experience \nof ourselves and others without being moved or troubled by any \nof them. Vexation and suffering are born of strong imagination \nand the soul's bad habit of translating sensation into pain. If this \nbad habit and imagination, and the ensuing restless or excited \nstate of feeling, were to disappear from human consciousness, \nman's bodily suffering would be cut down one hundred percent. \nHe would not even require anesthesia during surgery. (But one \nshould not venture to forgo anesthetics if he is not sufficiently \nstrong-minded. A sudden imagination of pain might cause such \nreaction as to produce death.) \nIn Indian ashrams in olden times, children were taught \nfrom an early age how to watch bodily changes with an aca-\ndemic interest.

But this so-called suffering \nis brought on by the soul's bad habit of magnifying and chang-\ning an intellectual perception into feeling. For example, suffer-\ning that comes from belief in goblins and spooks, as in night-\nmares, or intense fears that produce traumas and convulsions, \ndemonstrate that acute pain is experienced in the physical \norganism through mental agency only. \nNatural death—that is, in old age, or whenever the soul is \nready to change its mortal form—is just like the falling of ripe \nfruit from the tree, of its own accord, without the resistance that \ngreen fruit exhibits when being pulled down by a storm or other \ngreat force.

Ordi-\nnary painful death is to be avoided by attaining Self-realization. \nIn that consciousness, the yogi \n(a) experiences no pain in natural death; \n(b) retains consciousness and identity after death; \n(c) lives in his soul nature, and knows that nature as all-\npowerful and immortal. \nWhy, After Death, the Ordinary Man Forgets His Former Life \nUnnatural death, and death in a state of bodily attachment, \nare not only painful, they also obscure memory. Of course, un-\nless one is spiritually advanced, it is not always desirable to \nremember one's former life. The after-death oblivion of one's \nprevious identity allows him to forget his past consciousness of \nfailure, pain, and attachments, and to begin life anew. The only \ndisadvantage is that if he has not learned from past wrong ac-\ntions, he may repeat those experiences, ignoring the warning of \ntheir consequences—just as the inveterate alcoholic continues \nto drink the infernal liquid, even with the conscious knowledge \nof probable death from liver damage. \n* The external symptoms are minimized today by modern drugs not available \nwhen these notes were written in 1923. \nt After death, the soul, in an astral body of light, gradually awakens to a new ex-\nistence in the astral world, or heaven—on a high or low plane corresponding to \nthe merit of its actions on earth. The soul remains in the astral world for a kaimi-\ncally predetermined time; then it returns to earth in a new physical incarnation. \nThese life-death cycles continue until the soul breaks all mortal bonds, becomes \nliberated, and returns to God.

The fact is, memory after \ndeath cannot survive under the following conditions: \n(a) if there is attachment to the body,-\n(b) if there is attachment for past possessions, family, or \nfriends,-\n(c) if there is a strong entanglement in bad karma, and if \none has not risen above the effects of both good and bad \nactions.* \nIf, as in (a) and (b), the newborn soul remembered and was \nattached to its previous body, possessions, family, or friends, \nimagine the agony and frustration the soul would feel in a new \nincarnation! It would not like to begin a different life amidst a \nnew environment, a new family, and new friends. The soul is \na brother to all—to all mankind. Imagine how narrow it would \nbecome if it loved only one small circle of human beings. It \nwould not expand, and it wouldn't let those other souls expand, \nto reach the ultimate goal of unity. We must realize this one-\nness of our soul with all souls in the unity of the one Spirit, \nand it is impossible to do so unless the soul expands its sphere \nof family and<friends to include all. \nIn the case of (c) above, the soul would be extremely dis-\ncouraged, remembering past bad karma, struggles, and suffer-\ning, and wouldn't have the will to make new effort to progress. \nIt would forget its transcendent nature.

You may renounce outwardly by run-\nning away to the jungle to seek God, but your undisciplined de-\nsires will go with you. Yet if you have renounced something in \nyour mind, it is nothing at all to forgo it outwardly. I enjoy the \nfood I eat, but inwardly I am aware that it is God who is eating \nthrough me.

Why not say: \"Let me do what God wants me to do.\" \nI think you will be much happier, much more peaceful, much \nbetter off. \nThere will be greater joy in your life when you strive to \nplease God, not self. When you awaken in the morning, affirm: \n\"Lord, I offer this day unto You.

And these ideals of Amer-\nica and India will be the saviours of the world. They represent \nthe true essence of the path to salvation for the individual and \nfor the world in which he lives. Reducing these virtues from the \nnational to the individual level, we have the essence of Yoga: \nmeditation plus right activity, plus mental nonattachment.

That is a big definition. \nIn this world, our understanding is often shortsighted. When \nour mental vision is thus impaired, it is impossible to see into \nthe future to know what will be. Being blinded to the potential \nresults of our actions, we frequently do the wrong thing. In or-\nder to get along well in this world, you must learn to perceive \naccurately your immediate circumstances and surroundings, and \nto perceive also what you are headed for in the distant future. \nYou should have such keen and perceptive insight that you will \nbe able to tell what your life is going to be, two years or ten years \nhence. \nIf your eyes are shortsighted, you can only see clearly things \nthat are very near to you. And if you have longsighted vision, \nyou can clearly see and distinguish objects in the distance, but \nnot those close to you. Whether you are shortsighted or long-\nsighted, the remedy is corrective glasses,- otherwise, your vision \nwill be blurred and you will not see things as they are. Similarly, \nif your understanding is shortsighted or longsighted, it is time \nfor you to put on the mental glasses of attention—the ability to \nfocus the mind so that its perceptions are clear and accurate. \nThus the power of understanding is increased by attention. \n* The title derives from Proverbs 4:7 (Bible): \"Wisdom is the principal thing; \ntherefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.\" \n242 \n"}

Emotion \nblurs your vision. Moods blur your vision. Most people act, not \nout of understanding, but according to their moods. Prejudices \nalso blur your vision; these preconceived notions distort your \nunderstanding and prevent you from seeing clearly. In my ex-\nperience with the great ones in India, the first thing I learned \nwas to clear my vision of all forms of restlessness and mental \nprejudice that might blur my understanding. \nIt often happens that understanding has been prejudiced \nfrom childhood, according to environment and circumstances. \nSuch a warped understanding cannot see any situation clearly. \nYou should analyse the many prejudices that your understand-\ning is subject to. Any time you are making a decision or taking \naction, ask yourself if you are doing it through understanding, \nor through emotion or some other prejudicial influence on you \nmind. As long as you are subject to greed or anger; as long as \nyou are influenced by the wrong thinking of others; as long as \nyou are affected by the misunderstanding of others, so long will \nyour own understanding be unclear. \nSeek the Help of Spiritual Teacher Who Knows God \nBecause of prejudices, moods, emotions, you do not always \nsee your own mind as it really is. Therefore it is wise to find \nsome spiritual teacher or teachings that can show you how to \nanalyse and correct your thoughts. They have real understand-\ning who have fellowship with God.

I respected \nmy guru, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, not only because he was my \nspiritual teacher, but because he gave me that understanding. \nAny clarity in my vision I owe entirely to him, not to my fam-\nily or anyone else. No one loved parents more than I loved \nmine; but the clarity of vision my guru taught me made me \nunshakable in the path of truth. \nI remember when I left home and went to Banaras to re-\nnounce the world; I was after something much greater than \nmoney could afford.

I \nmust go to see my father. He loves me very much.\" \nMaster knew my family would try to hold me. \"Better not \ngo,\" he advised. \"You may not be able to come back.\" \nBut I said, \"Guruji, I promise I will return.\" For I knew \nthere was no other life for me. Love for our parents and attach-\nment to our parents are different things. Attachment clouds un-\nderstanding; divine love is never blinded. I know that I love my \nparents more than anyone else in the family does, and that by \ngiving my life to God I have done much more for them than I \nwould otherwise have been able to. \nWhen I went home, my father, who is not given to emotion, * \nwas so grateful to see me that he had tears in his eyes. \"You have \ncome back,\" he said. \"I am glad.\" In those few words there was \nmuch meant.

As a great saint once said, \"The moment you \nutter your love, some of that pure feeling has flown from your \nheart and become mixed witb the foulness of the mouth; the \ngerms and taint of the hps have soiled it.\" God loves you more \nthan anybody else. That is why He doesn't tell you. He shows His \nlove silently through demonstrations. As I progressed on the spir-\nitual path, I received more love from God than I ever could have \nfrom any human being. \nBut to get back to my story: As I stood before my father, he \nasked me to remain at home to take the place of my elder brother, \nwho had passed on.t \"Suppose I die?\" Father said. \"Who will look \nafter your younger brothers and your sisters?\" \n\"Father,\" I replied, \"I love you more than anyone else in this \nworld; but I love God more, He who gave me such a father.\" \n* Paramahansaji's father was still living at the time of this lecture.

As a re-\nsult of misunderstanding, they often do the very things that \nwill hurt them. When I say something vehemently, it is not be-\ncause of any hurt I feel from the actions of others, but because \nof the hurt those actions are going to do to them. If you are \nhurt by the wrong behaviour of others, and let your heart go \nblind, then you cannot truly love those persons. But when you \ncan keep your understanding clear, then you can help those you \nlove. You can see the springboard of their actions, the course of \ntheir actions, and what those actions will lead to. \nSome people readily respond to what I say; but others do \nnot, because they don't understand in what lies their own good. \nWhenever I try to guide people, it is only because of an earnest \ndesire to show them what is best for them.

It tests \nand reinforces thine armour of truth for use in the battle of life. \nThose who lovingly judge thee are thy best friends. Those who \nflatter thy faults are thy worst enemies. To receive impartial \ncriticism is to tune in with the law of progress. But to succumb \nto flattery is to poison both material and spiritual advancement. \nHarp not on the sins of others, neither on thine own—for-\ngive and forget past error. Give no life and form to thine own or \nothers' errors. Do not speak of others' faults. Never write about \nthem or make them public. Do not engage in or repeat rumours \nand gossip. Do not make an untruth immortal by talking about \nit, by sounding thine own trumpet in the chorus of dissent. And \ndo not draw personal conclusions and give voice to them when \nthou art not in a position to understand all sides. \nBe busy in making thyself good. Thine example would talk \na million times louder than words. Counteract criticism by \nhumbly living the principles of truth. Reform thyself; and by \nwatching thine example, let others be inspired to reform them-\nselves. That is what is wanted and needed in this world: those \nwho are criticizers of themselves, not others. Conquer vice by \nvirtuous example, error by truth, hatred by love, ignorance by \nwisdom, fear by courage, narrow-mindedness by understanding, \nbigotry by liberality. Let these virtues begin with thyself. Be at-\ntentive to thine own mental housecleaning, and perchance oth-\ners will be encouraged to get busy doing the same for themselves. \n"}

The first time Lahiri Mahasaya called Babaji to ma-\nterialize himself, to satisfy some doubting friends, Babaji didn't \nlike it. \"Do you call me for a trifle?\" he asked. \"I am very busy.\" * \nWhen a liberated master says that, he means he is busy with God, \ndoing God's will. The great ones are all active; it is the mission \nof some to try to strengthen the good in this world. And to the \nextent that they are able to do so, through receptive minds, the \ndevil's power weakens and God's power becomes stronger. \nWhen a great saint is resurrected in Spirit, and yet takes a \nform in responding to sincere, receptive devotees, it means he \nhas some part to play in the world's destiny.

If you \nwant to know Christ you have to be victorious in every test, to \nconquer the ego self even in little things. \nHow a Quarrelsome Man Was Changed \nIn New York there was a Hindu writer who couldn't stand \nanyone else. He was always fighting with somebody. One day \nhe became quarrelsome with me. He started by arguing with \nmy friends, and then burst through the door into my room and \nbegan insulting me. \"How is business?\" he asked, implying that \nI must be getting a lot of money from my lectures and classes. \nIt is not the money itself that is good or bad, but the use of \nit that makes it right or wrong. You can use it for good or for evil. \nEverything that has come to me I have given to God's work. \nAs this writer continued to insult me in the grossest terms, \nmy friends were giving me looks that meant, \"If you just say the \nword we will usher him out the door!\" I was worrying that they \nmight lose their self-control and throw him out. So when he \nmade further accusations, I started answering, \"Maybe you are \nright.\" I didn't say he was right; merely, \"Maybe you are right.\" \nAfter some time, I asked my friends to leave the room. The \nwriter slumped back on his chair and said, \"For the first time \nI have been licked.\" \n\"Don't think I am not going to give it to you,\" I replied. \n\"Tell me, why is it that an intelligent man like you behaves in \nthis way? You were only advertising your bad behaviour, and \nshowing what kind of person you are. I was concerned only for \nyou, that my friends didn't harm you.\" \n\"You are right,\" he answered. \"Tell me more.\" \nSo I said, \"You know, vultures soar high in the sky, but \ntheir whole mind is on the carrion on the ground below. They \nwait their chance; then swoop down to pick at that dead meat. \nThat is the way you behave. Wherever people are gossiping and \nfighting, there you love to go and pick at the bones. You are \nknown everywhere for your bad behaviour.\" \n"}

If someone insults you, \nor calls you a devil, that doesn't make you one. He who calls \nyou a devil is being used by the devil. The best thing under \nsuch circumstances is to remain quiet. If you refuse to fight, \nthen who can fight with you? And even if such a person goes a \nstep further and slaps you, and you do not respond, that slap \nwill burn in his palm throughout his life. But if you fight back, \nhe will only want to strike you twelve times harder.\" \nIf You Associate With Skunks, You Cannot Smell the Roses \nEvil people don't want to change their ways. The best pol-\nicy is to stay away from them. There is more goodness than \nevil in the world, and there are more good people than evil \nones. But if you associate with skunks, you cannot smell the \nroses. It only seems that evil is greater than good, because evil \nis hard to forget. If someone hurts you deeply, you remember \nit. But instead of concentrating on that, you should think of all \nthe good things about the person who has hurt you, and of all \nthe goodness that you have in your life. Don't take notice of \nthe insults people give you. And never let anything bring you \nto a decision to fight, nor give anyone the opportunity to fight \nwith you. If you do, you are a party to it. \nNumerous are the scars I bear for doing good. And if they \nmattered I wouldn't be here; I would be in the Himalayas. But \nsuch scars are worthwhile, for they help you to grow spiritually. \nOnly those who live the life of Christ and meet his tests find \nhim. To them Christ comes.

The \nscars of the body perish with the body, but wounds to the soul \non the spiritual battlefield are terrible. They are more deadly \nin their torture. Those who lose the battle of life by succumb-\ning to hatred and meanness will lose themselves. Those scars \nremain on the soul; they will go with you beyond the grave and \nlast for incarnations. If you are an angry or hateful person, who \nknows? You may come again on earth for many incarnations, \nhurting people and being hurt by them. \nWrath and hatred accomplish nothing. Love rewards.

You must \nlive more by the Christ-principles, instead of just talking about \nthem. When you live Christ's example, you will be able to see \nhim. He is like a fragrance, all-pervading. But it is only through \nreceptive souls that he works. If you call to Christ with all your \nheart, and if you have learned the lesson that you must never \nfail to live in humility and love, and to meditate deeply upon \nGod, Christ will come to you. You can see him in flesh and \nblood, even as he has come to Babaji, St. Francis, and others \nwho are in tune. \n"}

Why should \nwe be interested in reincarnation? Isn't one lifetime sufficient to \nworry about? In one sense, it is good to think that we live only \nonce. And if it is so, we must not waste our time, but live every \nminute grandly and beautifully, in a spiritual way. It is true that \nno individual has been bom on earth twice as the same person. \nThis is according to God's wishes, and since the beginning of time \nHe has not changed His policy. Shakespeare wrote of \"The undis-\ncover'd country from whose bourne / No traveler returns.\"* \nOnce the hand of fate writes that you must depart, the decree is \nfinal and you are gone; and there is the end of your present form. \nSo in that sense there is no return, because regardless of your \nidentity in your previous incarnation, you start this life anew, \nwith no recollection of who you were before. Because of that lim-\nitation on our consciousness, we see this life as the beginning and \nthe end. \nIt may seem to you that I am teaching a philosophy con-\ntrary to that of the Hindus. But I am dealing with truth from \nthe relative standpoint of God's creation. I read from the book \nof God, and from that library I speak to you. This is the way I \nlearned from my guru, [Swami Sri Yukteswar] and the way he \nlearned from his master [Lahiri Mahasaya]. Without direct per-\nception you can't really know at all if something is true. \nAgain, relatively speaking, if we incarnate only once, then \nwe see in nature a devastating, iconoclastic method.

Are we just factory \nproductions, with no control over what happens to us? If this life \nis the beginning and the end, then I say it is a terrible injustice. It \nis ruthless.

We find it in the law \nof reincarnation, with its corollary of karma, the principle of \ncause and effect. God at some time started all souls in a fairly \nuniform way. We all had equal goodness and potential within \nus; but owing to the misuse of our intelligence and free will, \nwe have created terrible disorder and lack of equality, lack of \nuniformity, in life. \nYou can't generalize about people, because God has given \nevery individual freedom to make his own choices. No matter \nwho we are or what we are—and even though we are somewhat \nbound by circumstances of our karma, the effects of our past \nactions—we can do anything we want to in our minds.

We \nstagger at the wild way the world is moving—so many different \nideals held by so many millions of people, contradicting and con-\nflicting with one another. One person or group wants one thing, \nand another person or group wants the opposite. There are so \nmany customs to bind us, so many philosophies to confuse us. I \noften say that we are all a little bit crazy and we don't know it, \nbecause people of the same craziness mix with their own kind. It \nis only when people differently crazy come together that they \nfind out their own craziness. \nGod wants to make something beautiful out of this earth, \nbut there are lots of things that have gone out of control be-\ncause we have misused the freedom He gave us.

Those memories cause the baby to move around with \nlife; it wants to get out. The soul feels powerless in that con-\nfinement, remembering breath, yet unable to breathe. It strug-\ngles to be freed from the prison of the mother's body. When the \nbaby is about to be born, an intense prayer-thought goes out \nfrom that soul. That is why some infants are born with hands \nfolded as in prayer. But as soon as the child is born, it forgets its \npast. Only if the consciousness is highly developed will memo-\nries of the past be retained. \nFor instance, if you take a person from one house to another, \nhe remembers it, because he was conscious during that transi-\ntion.

But suppose an Eskimo in Alaska \nsustains a head injury that causes unconsciousness and amnesia, \nand is put on a train and brought to Los Angeles for treatment. \nWhen he awakens, if asked whence he came, his reply would be, \n\"I don't remember.\" Also, under the spell of hypnosis you can \nbe made to feel like a different personality, so that you don't \nremember your real name. At death a state of coma comes, in \nwhich you forget everything. But do you forget everything? That \nis the question. Your mind may not remember, but your soul \ndoes.

Your fear of \nthat experience might produce the condition again. If you had \ncontinuity of remembrance, and could recall that as John in \nyour last life you were poor and died of a terrible disease; and \nthat now you have come back in this life as Jack, and again you \nare afflicted with poverty and sickness, you would be hope-\nlessly discouraged. It would paralyse your will to succeed. \nWe don't want to remember things that are unpleasant or \nevil. That is why nature obscures our memories from one life-\ntime to the next. In going from one body to another, something \nhappens that makes us forget our past existence. God is good \nto us in that respect. \nOf course, if we were wonderful in our last life, we might \nwant to remember that, especially when facing some trouble \nin this life.

Therefore it stands to reason that some great in-\ntelligence must have created us. There is no doubt about this. \nAnd certainly an intelligent God would not bring us on earth \nwith so many inequalities without giving us equal opportuni-\nties to forsake evil and express goodness. He would give us \ntime in which to practice that goodness and reap the blessings \nof right action. What is the use of scriptures, or of following di-\nvine laws, if this life is the end? Where is the love and justice \nof God if the hereafter is eternal heaven for a chosen few and \neternal torment of hell for the error-stricken? God's law of rein-\ncarnation shows that when a person is evil—and no one can be \nso wholly evil that he can be forever barred from the kingdom \nof God—he is given a chance to work out that evil and to turn \nto goodness. Evil is like a graft; it is not a permanent quality in \nman, for everyone is a child of God. Every night God reminds \nyou in sleep that you are not the body and its habits. You are \nfree, you are happy. The purpose of reincarnation is to provide \nopportunity for man to go on working out all his desires and \nexpressing all that he wants to express, until he realizes his \ntrue nature as a child of God, and understands that reunion \nwith God is the true object of all his seeking, the Goal of all \nmankind. \nWe seek religion because we want to do away with our suf-\nfering forever.

I will see whether I find you sleeping, or \nbuilding up material desires, or if you are dutifully tending the \nhouse of life I have given you to care for.\" \nPresent Tendencies Reflect Temperament of Past Lives \nThe most important thing to know about reincarnation is \nthat this life is a new opportunity given by God to destroy the \nevil and cultivate the good that you have brought from past \nlives. Every good quality you have is a heritage of the past. And \nthose bad tendencies that seem to be beyond your control—ten-\ndencies that are staying with you in spite of all your attempts \nto destroy them—are also from the past; otherwise they would \nnot grip you from the beginning of your life. Of course, you have \nacquired some new qualities in this incarnation, but the salient \ntemperament of your past life has been brought forward into \nthis one. That is why you find yourself a helpless victim of cer-\ntain idiosyncrasies. But you can overcome them. You must free \nyourself from them now, otherwise they will pursue you into \nanother life. Death won't make an angel of you; self-effort will. \nIf you have an angry temper, rid yourself of it now. If you \nare peevish or moody, overcome it now. Some people get angry \nwithout cause, no matter how kind or thoughtful you are to-\nward them. Others habitually indulge in bad moods and nega-\ntive thoughts. The most practical use of our God-given reason \nis to analyse what aspects of our nature we have brought from \nthe past, and to rid ourselves of the bad habits now. \nIt is certain the bad and good tendencies that follow one \nsince birth were not acquired in this life. Whence could they \nhave come other than as a carryover from past existences? If \nyou study children, you can see something of their past incar-\nnations reflected in their behaviour. Why are some so smart \nand others less keen? Why are some children born with a great \ntalent for music, or mathematics? They have had no opportunity \n"}

It was highly cultivated \nin a past life. In some children you can see an old soul talking \nto you. Others are very infantile and cry over every little thing; \nthey lacked emotional maturity in their last life. Early child \ntraining is so important because you can easily recognize those \nlatent tendencies that should be nurtured or discouraged. After \na child reaches the age of about five, it becomes more difficult \nto distinguish his past-life tendencies from those traits he is \nacquiring from present influences and the increasing awaken-\ning of his free will in this life. \nAny time I have found something hounding me from the \npast, I have cut it out. As a child I had a very fiery disposition. \nAnd then one day I resolved that I was not going to carry this \nanger with me anymore. I said, \"Get out!\" and from that day \nforth, I never felt anger again. I don't tell people I am not an-\ngry; I let them think I am, because sometimes a little fire is \nnecessary. But inwardly I couldn't be angry if I tried. I have \nnever willingly hurt anyone. Why exist with bad habits that we \nwill carry from one lifetime to the next? Why not overcome \nthem? That is why we have come into this world. \nYour Divine Nature Is What You Must Cultivate \nRemember, you are a child of God. Your divine nature is \nwhat you must cultivate. Do not allow your happiness to be \nconditioned by anything material. That is the first lesson you \nlearn in the hermitages in India. Here, you want everything to \nbe comfortable and just so. You must be able to forego anything \nwithout its disturbing your happiness. Learn to be evenminded, \nregardless of the conditions that arise every day. \nDo not even allow yourself to be limited to the conscious-\nness that you are a man or a woman: You are a soul made in \nGod's image. Most souls born as women in this incarnation were \nwomen in their previous existence. However, if in this life they \nmanifest strong manly tendencies, it is probable that they were \nborn in a male body before. If one is a man now and has strong \nmanly tendencies, he will be born as a man again. If you want to \nbe a man in your next incarnation, cultivate reason more, and \nmasculine interests,- and if you want to be a woman, cultivate \nfeeling, and interests that are more feminine.

Every hundred \nyears, about fifteen hundred million people die. They are gone \nand forgotten, except those we love, and the great men and \nwomen who leave a permanent mark on history. We keep \"con-\ntact\" with them through our thoughts of them, so in that way \nthey still live with us. But where are they, physically speaking? \nWhere are the God-realized saints and great world citizens of \nthe past? God has shown me the subsequent or present incar-\nnations of many of them. Some are playing similar active roles \non earth today. But God doesn't like to have these things talked \nabout too much. It takes away the charming mystery of His \nplay and would cause the actors to be stilted in their new roles. \nPerhaps we wonder most of all about those we love. Where \nare they? Why are they spirited away from us? A brief good-\nbye, and then they disappear behind the veil of death. We feel \nso helpless and sad; and there is nothing we can do about it. \nThough all souls are born into a family of seeming strangers, \ntheir parents love them; but they don't know why. Are these \nsouls sent for us to love just to cause us hurt when they are \nsnatched away? If this is so, isn't it foolish to love at all? Isn't \nit foolish to be attached? Because you don't know when your \nloved ones will be taken from you, or when death will take you \nfrom them. When someone is dying, though he cannot speak, \na desire is expressed in his consciousness. He is thinking, \"I am \nleaving my loved ones,- will I ever see them again?\" And those \nwhom he is leaving behind also think, \"I am losing him. Will \nhe remember me? Will we meet again?\" That part is natural. \nNow, these thoughts would not have been given to us if there \nwere no answer to satisfy our souls. It is only because it is so \ndifficult to know these truths that you don't find the answer. \nWhen I lost my mother in this life, I promised myself that I \n"}

I gave my love to God. \nThat first experience with death was very serious for me. But \nthrough it I learned much. I searched undaunted for months and \nyears until I found the answer to the mystery of life and death, \nand whether or not souls reincarnate. To you it is only a thought, \njust a belief, because you have no proof. But I am not talking to \nyou from mere belief. I found proof of life after death, and of rein-\ncarnation. Therefore I can speak truthfully to you. What I tell \nyou, I have experienced. I found in this life many souls that I \nknew before. That is what I meant in my poem, \"On Coming to \nthe New-Old Land of America,\" * when I wrote: \"Sleeping mem-\nories, of friends once more to be, did greet me—sailing o'er the \nsea....\" I can recognize souls whom I knew before in other life-\ntimes. You may ask how. God has given me that power because \nI first sought and found Him. \nHow to Recognize Souls You Have Known Before \nThere is a way that you also can recognize those whom \nyou have known before. For example, we may associate with \nsome people day after day, yet never really know them or feel \nclose to them. But there are others with whom we feel imme-\ndiately a deep harmony the first time we meet. It is not any-\nthing physical. It is a memory of the past. Many, many people \nthat I have met in this country, and in India and elsewhere, I \nhave known before. The friendship is even stronger now. It was \nnot finished in past lives, and so it had to continue to evolve in \nthis life. Friendship is the highest form of love. As such, it is \nmeant to evolve into the divine manifestation of God's eternal \nlove. Friendship is the highest relationship, because in friend-\nship there is no compulsion; it is born of the free choice of the \nheart. It is God calling souls back to unity in Him. If you can \nbe a friend to all, unconditionally, that is divine love. \nNot many in this world find true friends,- mere acquain-\ntances are not to be confused with real friends. There is no at-\ntachment in true friendship, nor is it founded in selfish human \nlove. It is an unconditional relationship between two or more \nsouls: they may be unrelated, or family members, or marriage \n* In Songs of the Soul. \n"}

It is best formed between souls who are seeking God \nor who have found God. Such was the friendship that existed \nbetween Christ and his disciples. Otherwise, relationships de-\nvelop into attachment and remain on the plane of human love, \ntaking the soul away from supreme friendship with God. \nTrue friendship may be developed between woman and \nwoman, man and man, or man and woman. The important con-\nsideration is that it be based upon soul qualities, not worldly \nqualities or attractions of the flesh. This can come only when \nyou free yourself from the consciousness that you are a man or \na woman. \nIf you are seeking such friends, pray to God: \"Lord, lead me \nto those who are friends of the past, that I may continue with \nthem the friendship that was interrupted through separation by \ndeath. Send such friends to me, because I want to help them with \nmy thought of Thee.\" That is a wonderful ideal, isn't it? To have \nfriendship not for idle talk and useless pastimes, but to develop \nthe ultimate friendship with God. Only on that plane of sincere \nfriendship will you find lasting happiness with any other soul. \nDon't engage in too many socials. They are all right once \nin a while, but frequent socializing takes up too much valuable \ntime. Enjoy divine thoughts with your friends. Use your time \nfor God. If you find souls who will share that goal, then you \ncan drink God together from the chalice of divine friendship. \nThe highest duty God has given you is to develop His con-\nsciousness in yourself and to help true friends to do the same. \nSo long as life sweetly sings with God, it will bring happiness \nto you and to others. Friends that harmonize spiritually with \nyou are therefore very important. \nNo matter what difference of opinion there is between you \nand such friends, there is always understanding and communi-\ncation. In that relationship, regardless of differing views, you \nhave mutual respect and cherish your friendship above every-\nthing else. True friendship established in God is the only rela-\ntionship that is lasting. \nOn one occasion, while I was travelling on a train, my at-\ntention was drawn to a man who was drinking and playing \ncards.

Also, hate attracts, as does love. You don't want the mag-\nnet of your hate to draw your enemies near you. Never hate any-\none.

So if you are meditating, you are on a high \nplane of thought; tramp souls, or negative or evil souls living \non the lower astral planes, cannot get in touch with you. \nOne who is highly developed, and has mastered all levels \nof consciousness, can see into all realms of the astral world, \nhigh and low; and he can spiritually help the souls on those \nplanes to work out some of their karma. That other world is as \nreal to me as this one. Sometimes when I sleep on my left side, \nI see all kinds of dark souls dancing around. I bless them, and \nthey go away. I rarely see such souls when I sleep on my right \nside, because the right side of the body is the positive side. \nThere is a stronger flow of divine life current there, whose spir-\nitual vibration serves as a screen blocking off negative forces. \nThis is why, during practise of the Self-Realization [Yogoda Sat-\nsanga] Aum Technique, * the meditator is taught to concentrate \non the cosmic vibration in the right ear. \nWhen you are thinking of God or meditating upon God, or \nconcentrating at the Christ Consciousness [Kutastha \nChai-\ntanya] center at the point between the eyebrows, no astral be-\nings can intrude on your consciousness. God is deeply respected \nin the other region—even by lower astral beings, who cannot \nstand high spiritual vibrations. \nTechnique of Sending Thoughts to Departed Souls \nTo send your thoughts to loved ones who have passed on, \nsit quietly in your room and meditate upon God. When you feel \nHis peace within you, concentrate deeply at the Christ centre, \nthe centre of will at the point between the two eyebrows, and \n* Taught in the Yogoda Satsanga Lessons.

Permanent satisfaction with \nthe known, with no vision for the future, no effort to improve, no \ninitiative to explore, no impulse to interpret, would have meant \nstagnation of the human race, and hence annihilation. \nThe terms \"known\" and \"unknown\" are relative.

Training not only encourages the seed to grow \ninto a plant, it has the additional merit of improving the quality \nof the seed through culture.

Some, such as selfish desires, may need strong doses of ad-\nvice and treatment. There are others that are safe enough to be \nrelied on, or at least tolerated, such as the self-preserving and \nsocial instincts. A special few need to be deliberately spurred \non—sympathetic tendencies, spirit of reverence, service, love \nof truth. We have to attend to each propensity in a way that is \nmost suitable. That is the proper education of the inner being. \nIn other words, we must be true to ourselves, not in the \nsense of bringing flower offerings to every tendency we have, \neven the baser ones, but in the sense of recognizing the place \nof every one of them in the scheme of our life, and checking \nand subordinating, or guiding and directing, each one of the \ncrowd in such a way as to make it contribute to the general \nwell-being and happiness of the whole. \nThough some tendencies have been cited and generalized, \nthey are only a small part of the whole potential crowd from \n"}

The law of affinity is a matter of \ncorrespondence between what we are potentially and actually, \non the one hand, and the broad world on the other. \nThe cue to our conduct is always supplied from the known \nand unknown within. What we are going to be is about seventy-\nfive percent foreordained by ourselves. That \"horoscope\" of ten-\ndencies from past incarnations attracts our present hereditary \ncondition as well as the other circumstances we will draw to \nourselves. Fatalists, and some inept astrologers who try to com-\npute the unknown, are greatly mistaken in their belief that life \nis one hundred percent foretold and can be astrologically \ncharted. They leave no margin for the freedom of the individ-\nual: free choice to change himself this way or that, free choice \nto decide between two courses of action. In most cases, though, \nthe free will of man is nothing more than a slave—in the guise \nof freedom, but fettered to past tendencies. \nYet everyone knows there is such a thing as an uncondi-\ntioned decision that we make after rationally balancing the \npros and cons of a certain matter. Having made such a decision, \nif we exercise our will, we can change many things in our lives \nthat appeared unchangeable, or that may have been predicted \nto be incontrovertible. This willing is freedom of will. Free will \ndoes exist. If it were not so, none could escape the vicious cir-\ncle of his fate once he had drawn it. Growth would be circum-\nscribed. Newer channels of activities would have little scope. \nThe evolution of human beings would hardly emerge from the \nlevel of savagery. \nThe conception of new social orders, progressive ideas in \npolitical government, advanced methods of scientific explo-\nration, new departments of research, sallies of literary activ-\nity—all prove the ability of man to exercise free choice in every \nline by the power of will. \nAs previously stated, you are born with about seventy-five \npercent of your life predetermined by your past.

If you yourself, through \nyour own free choice and effort of will, do not determine what \nthat twenty-five percent will be, the seventy-five percent will \nmake the twenty-five percent for you, and you will become a \npuppet. That is, you will be ruled absolutely by your past, by \nthe influence and effects of your past tendencies. This is why \nspiritual training is vital. It takes into consideration not only \nthe seventy-five percent of our lives that we already are, but \nalso designates the methods to mold the brand new twenty-five \npercent that we ourselves are going to create by the exercise of \nour freedom. \nCosmic Law Is Activated by Our Decisions \nThe Cosmic Law is not the doer of things, but the evolu-\ntionary mode of operation of cause and effect. This law works \nchanges when activated by the agency of our decisions, which \nare determined either by our past tendencies, or by our present \nfree choice. The motive of Eternal Good that is interlinked \nwith the Cosmic Law is in every atom, and in us too. It is what \ninherently urges us to leam from past mistakes, and to use our \nfree choice and will to initiate those positive causes that pro-\nduce everlasting good effects. \nWhat we do automatically is within a predetermined realm \nof the law of cause and effect. That is, when habit—psychologi-\ncal or physiological—determines our conduct, the habit is the \ncause, and our conditioned response is the effect. What we do \nwith a distinct motive decided upon by free choice is within the \nrealm of \"final cause.\" When we act in accordance with a fore-\nthought of a distant purpose, such as to realize a goal or attain-\nment of an object, and we harness our habits and will-initiated \nactions to serve as the means to that end, we are acting accord-\ning to the \"final cause.\" Every motive is a \"final cause,\" and \nevery \"final cause\" starts the series of ordinary cause and effect. \nPresident Wilson wanted world peace. He boarded a ship, crossed \nover to France, and gave his \"fourteen points.\" The thought of \nworld peace is the \"final cause,\" or motive; the preparation for \nthe trip, taking the boat and crossing the Atlantic, delivering his \nspeech, and so forth, are the series of ordinary causes and effects \nstarted by the \"final cause.\" \n"}

In other words, everything happens according to the will \nof God as expressed in His Cosmic Law. We are instruments for \nthe fulfilment of that Law. Our part is to make the right free \nchoice so that our instrumentality is used to fulfil the good ef-\nfects rather than the unpleasant ones that cause suffering as a \nmeans of teaching man to avoid wrong actions. When our char-\niots run into the ditch because they were hitched to wrong \nactions, they have to be pulled out by strenuous effort of our \nwill and God's will as expressed in the Cosmic Law. \nFrankly speaking, from the highest metaphysical point of \nview, the truth is that the Cosmic Law has its hand in every-\nthing that we have done or are going to do. Fortunately, we do \nnot realize that. If we try to fathom with our crude understand-\ning that greatest mystery by which the universe is governed, we \nwould become paralysed from self-induced fatalistic blows to \nour psychological make-up. Do not let your dream of life be bro-\nken by fatalism when it is not yet time for you to wake in the \ndaylight of God. You will be puzzled by your wrong judgment of \nGod's ways. The first step toward understanding is to use your \nwill to make those choices that are in harmony with the Eternal \nGood within the Cosmic Law. \nLive Life for God \nWhen you live life, not for God but for itself, every mo-\nment of it is incurring a debt to Him. Those debts pile up, day \nafter day. Borrow from the commonly unknown bank of God, \nthe universal Spirit, and clear your debt to Him. You can get \nthe loan only for the asking. And you will not be hounded for \npayment of interest either. This is the only bank that makes \nloans and does not worry the recipients with the demand of in-\nterest, because the Universal Bank is always ready to invest in \nthe betterment of its own property, the world, and to look af-\nter the interests of its tenants. This is a form of banking that \nnone but God allows. If you do not pay off the debts you have \ncontracted by your life in matter, isolated from God, suffering \nwill be your jail sentence. \n"}

Most mornings when \nyou awaken you make up your mind to do something, but you \ndon't do what you had planned. Modern life is an unbalanced \nexistence. Everyone is racing for something he does not really \nwant when he gets it. Before you create compelling desires, dis-\ncriminate carefully. If you are driving a horse that is running \naway with your carriage, your first need is to control the horse. \nAnalyse your actions and find out whether your life is sim-\nilarly uncontrolled, pulled toward certain destruction by the \nwild steeds of your senses.

The \nsame ground on which you fall can be used as a support to help \nyou get up again, if you learn from your experiences. But to \nstay fallen is a grievous weakness.

If you \npray, and believe what you pray, you shall receive God's bless-\nings and help. If you have a bad habit, create a mental antidote \nand continuously apply it until the poisonous habit is neutral-\nized.

They come from \nthe influence of the habits of your family, of your forefathers, \nand of the whole world. Resist those influences. While trying \nto rid yourself of a physiological habit or condition, do not give \nin to it even mentally. Do not let your mind accept any limit-\ning suggestion from the body. Look after the body, but be above \nit. Know that you are separate from your mortal form. Put up \na great mental barrier between your mind and body. Affirm: \"I \nam apart from the body. No heat, cold, or sickness can touch \nme. I am free.\" Your limitations will become less and less. But \nif the body convinces the mind of sickness, then suffering be-\ncomes doubled. If you neglect your body and do not strengthen \nyour mind, you may acquire chronic disease. Never let your \nmind be controlled by your body; this is extremely important. \nMake up your mind you will not accept any conditions im-\nposed on it by the body. But denial alone is not enough. You \nmust train your mind to be completely apart from body con-\nsciousness. This does not mean you should neglect a broken \narm, affirming that there is no arm. Give it the proper physi-\ncal treatment but do not be mentally disturbed by the bodily \ndiscomfort. Be dissociated from whatever happens to you. You \nwill find then that no pain can ever again hurt you. \nHealth and sickness are dreams of the mind. You are Spirit. \nYou are above them both. Though you are temporarily jailed in \nthe body, mentally rise above imprisoning thoughts of health \nand sickness. In the constant fear of sickness, you are concen-\ntrating on it and attracting it to you. Make your mind imper-\nvious to all bodily sensations. I do not even feel the need for \nsleep when I remind myself that I am Spirit, and that Spirit \ndoes not sleep. \n"}

I felt God! \nIf through sincerity and unconditional devotion your prayers \nreach God, it matters not if your sins be deeper than the ocean \nand higher than the Himalayas. He will destroy those karmic \nobstacles. For a time, perhaps, you may sink under a stratum of \ndarkness,- but still you are a spark of an Eternal Flame. You can \nhide the spark, but you can never destroy it. \nGod is in everything. When you have Him, you have ev-\nerything. Whatever I wish for now comes to me immediately. \nSo I must be careful in my wishing. First and last, I wish for \nGod. When I wish for others, I have to struggle, for I have to \nfight their karmas. * In seeking God you must be careful not to \nbe secretly wishing for something else when you wish for Him, \nsaying to yourself, \"First I will wish for God; then surely I will \nget the automobile I want.\" That is not right. You cannot fool \nGod. \nWe must seek union of our consciousness with God's con-\nsciousness. When we have that, our prayers will not be way-\nlaid. We are not beggars.

But who knows whether or not your head may be \non the block waiting for death? Krishna said, \"Get away from \nthis ocean of suffering and misery.\" * He meant that we must go \nwhere we can find real happiness. It can be had only from God's \nhands. But the greatest obstacle in our path is our bad habits. \nHabit is both our best friend and our worst enemy. And that is \nthe theme of this morning's service. \nHabit Defined \nHabit is an acquired aptitude or inclination to a particular \naction, instilled by repetition. It can decrease, or resist, or fa-\ncilitate the force of action. The mental mechanism of habit \nwas given to us to simplify the process of our actions. Without \nits aid, we would have to learn the same things over each new \nday. For instance, the writer works daily at his writing until he \nis able to express his thoughts clearly and interestingly. If that \nhabit were not established, he would have to relearn repeatedly \nthe basics of composition. Similarly, if you had no such power \nof habit, then every day of your life you would have to relearn \neverything you do, even how to say your name. In other words, \nyou would remain like a helpless infant. \nHabits are necessary, but we misuse their power. Habit is \nlike a parrot: If you teach it to sing good songs and say good \nwords, it will repeat them over and over. And if you teach it to \nswear, it will do the same, whether you want it to or not, em-\nbarrassing you and others. Likewise, your bad habits will make \nnot only you, but everyone around you, uncomfortable; whereas \nyour good habits will be a joy to you and to others also. There-\nfore, it is tenable that you should prefer good habits and destroy \nbad ones. \nHabits are formed gradually, by repetition of an action. It is \nsaid that it normally takes the average person about eight years \nto firmly establish a habit. But habit formation can be quick-\nened. In childhood especially, the mind is more pliable, and it is \nthen easier to form good habits. However, in ancient India, our \n* \"For these whose consciousness is fixed in Me, I become before long their \nRedeemer to bring them out of the sea of mortal births\" (Bhagavad Gita XH:7). \n"}

They \nselected children according to the good karma and habits they \nbrought with them from past incarnations. You have probably \nseen some children who from the earliest age were absolutely \nunwilling to be good. This is because they had developed bad \nhabits in previous lives. On the other hand, many children are \nnaturally inclined to right behaviour because of good tendencies \ndeveloped in former incarnations. \nOlder people reflect the inner influence of past-life habits \njust as children do. When persons who were spiritually inclined \nin the past take up the spiritual path, they keep on going with \nyouthful enthusiasm to the end. Others who have brought with \nthem anti-spiritual habits will not take to the spiritual path in \nspite of repeated urgings, unless in this life they wake up and \nbegin to realize that God is the only source of happiness. \nWatch Out for Hidden Bad Habits of Past Lives \nSince you do not know what good or bad habits you have \nestablished in previous lives, you should be careful about what \nyou do in this life, lest the slightest stimulus give a fresh hold \nto some bad habit that has been trailing you through incarna-\ntions. This explains how it can happen that a person may take \njust one drink, and his old habit of former lives awakens and \ncatches him; before long, he has become an alcoholic. There-\nfore, one shouldn't even try such experiences as those produced \nby alcohol and drugs, which are not only useless, but poten-\ntially harmful. Don't flirt with unproductive, dangerous habits. \nThe word \"karma\" means action; also, the effects of ac-\ntions. The nature of those effects determines whether you have \nreaped good or bad karma. When you say, \"It is my karma that \nhas brought this evil event upon me,\" you have not distin-\nguished between good and evil karma. Good karma brings good \nresults, and predisposes one to repeat good actions. Evil karma \nproduces evil results, and is the fertile soil for more evil ac-\ntions. If you have a particular bad habit or karmic inclination, \ndon't mix with those who have the same kind of bad habit. If \nyou tend to be greedy, avoid the company of others who are \n"}

If you have a desire to drink, stay away from those who \ndrink. People who support your bad habits are not your friends. \nThey will cause you to throw away your soul's joy. Avoid the \ncompany of wrongdoers and mix with those who are good. \nTrain Children to Develop a Preference for Right Habits \nIn this modern age, everybody needs to be trained, because \nthey have so much temptation placed before them. All parents \nshould train their children to develop a taste for better habits. \nConsider more seriously the responsibility of guiding your chil-\ndren. Many bad habits are imposed on them in the environ-\nment of the schools! Influenced by other children, they feel \nthey have no choice,- if someone doesn't join the crowd and \nsmoke or drink, he is considered a sissy. Youngsters thus suc-\ncumb to all kinds of wrong behaviour. *I know so many boys \nand girls who have taken to drink and smoking, and even \nworse. Those young children that I have taken into the ashram \nfor training I consider my own, and my heart goes out with \nthem when they go into the environment of the public school. \nI tell them, \"Don't be a doormat. Dare to be different, and to \nsay no when others try to persuade you into wrong ways.\" \nCoeducation is a total failure. You will learn this some-\ntime. Coeducation for college-age students is less questionable. \nI was once going to write about these things, and then I thought, \n\"Why should I? Who will pay any attention?\" \nThe very fabric of your family life is being destroyed be-\ncause of the lack of moral and spiritual education at home as \nwell as in the schools. You must do your part to teach your chil-\ndren to resist evil. You have here such a great nation, but the \nabuse of freedom is the road to destruction. When I was a child \nin India, we were given strict moral and spiritual culture at \nhome. Mother used to tell me, \"Never desire wealth.\" I asked \nwhy, and she said, \"It will make you a slave.\" We were never \npermitted even to utter the word \"wine,\" because drinking was \nrecognized as an evil habit. Reason with your children. Remind \nthem that by developing wrong habits they are wading into the \ncesspool of error. If they should go on in that way, it will be too \nlate for them to come out of it. All the joy of life will be over \nfor them. \n"}

It is \n\"how-to-live\" education—how to develop a harmonious, moral \nlife, stronger will power, and spiritual understanding—that will \nbring happiness. The women in this country have much devo-\ntion and spiritual inclination, but as mothers few of them prop-\nerly train those ideals into their children. The boys here would \nbe wonderful if taught how to develop their \"won't\" power. \nWhen You Say No to Temptation, Mean It \nWhen you say no to temptation, you must mean no. Don't \ngive in. The spineless weakling all the time says yes. But great \nminds are full of nos. The weak-willed become doormats for \neverybody to walk over and trample on,- they deserve this treat-\nment for giving in to their weaknesses. Remember, temptation \nmay appear to offer something very pleasurable in the beginning, \nbut it leads to restlessness, always seeking something different, \nalways seeking new thrills. Resisting temptations isn't the \ndenial of all the pleasures of life; it is to have supernal control \nover what you want to do. I am showing you the way to real \nfreedom, not the false sense of freedom that in fact is compelling \nyou to do what your habits lead you to do. \nDon't Cater to Likes and Dislikes \nCatering to your likes and dislikes is also to be avoided. \nThey, too, are cultivated habits.

To follow what you should \ndo, irrespec-\ntive of likes and dislikes, is what brings lasting happiness. \nMany times we dislike certain things that we should like \nbecause they are good for us. This is particularly true of our \neating habits. If you mix sand and water and then plaster a wall \nwith it, the mixture will stay put for a while. But when the \nwater dries, the sand will fall away from the wall. In the same \nway, what pleases your taste does not always satisfy the needs \nof your body.

As a result, their kidneys and in-\ntestines are affected, and all kinds of troubles develop. Meat is \nnot an essential to health; in fact, it is harmful. The cow is sup-\nplied with all its nourishment merely by eating grass. The ele-\nphant and the horse get their strength and stamina from a veg-\netarian diet. Why do intelligent human beings cultivate such \nbad eating habits? Why do you persist in wrong eating, even \nwhen you know better? Because you were not started out with \nthe right habits. No matter what anyone says, you want to eat \nthe wrong things because the habit of liking those foods has \nbeen established. That is the misuse of the power of habit. If \nfrom the beginning you form the habit of eating the right foods, \nyou won't crave white bread and lots of sugars and starches and \nfried foods; you won't be used to them. \nBad Habits Are Like an Octopus \nBad habits are like an octopus—they have many tentacles \nto hold you in their grip. And once they enwrap you, those \noctopus-like habits feed on you,- they will destroy you. But if \ngood habits have a hold on you, they will nourish you. \nDon't at all let your mind tell you that it is so hard to be \ngood and so easy to be bad. It is much easier to be good than to \nsuffer the consequences of wrong actions. It is a little difficult \nsometimes to resist temptation, because your senses try to en-\ntrap you. But once you get into the habit of being good, it is very \nhard to be bad; because you know you will be beaten up within \nand without by doing something you know is wrong. There is \nno fun in having bad habits; evil destroys all the fun. It satiates \nthe mind so that soon there is no longer any joy in over-eating, \nin sexual over-activity, in over-indulgence of any of the senses. \nIf in anything you overdo, remember, you are under the influ-\nence and in the grip of bad habits. For instance, if you have ul-\ncers of the stomach, and through habit continue to eat meat, or \nhot or fried foods, which further irritate the stomach and take \naway the scabs formed by nature to heal the ulcers, the ulcer-\nated condition will worsen and may develop into cancer or a \n"}

Rather, you should eat pureed and soft foods, and \nother foods that do not irritate the stomach lining. Why let \nhabit make you eat those things you know will harm you? \nJust as crime doesn't pay, so bad habits don't pay, because \nthey will destroy your health and happiness and peace of mind; \nand they will also set a bad example for those you love. You \nmust strive to conquer harmful habits now. Don't be a weak-\nling. Stay away from the things that stimulate your bad habits. \nAnd always choose good substitutes that will bring you peace \nof mind and a sound, healthy body. \nTemptations are charming and strong, but you are stronger, \nbecause the image of God is within you. No matter how many \ntimes you fall, you can rise again. But when you admit defeat, \nthen you are lost. And lost is your peace and happiness. \nTrain Your Will to Be Unenslaved \nSaint Ignatius of Loyola was called the saint of will power. \nHe was not satisfied to wait for the grace of God to descend. \nHe trained his will so that he could commune with God at any \ntime. He said, \"I can find God at all times, whenever I wish, \nand any man of good will can do the same. As the body can be \nexercised by going, walking, and running, so the will of man \ncan be trained by exercises to find the will of God.\" That is \nwhat I believe—to train your will, to have complete mastery \nover your will, so that you can do the things you ought to do, \nwith the will unbound by bad habits. \nOne should have freedom even to cut his own throat if he \nwants to; but he certainly should not use his freedom, his free \nwill, to do any such thing! It seems, however, that in the name \nof freedom it is human nature to want to do the very things \nthat are not good for us. Tell the self-willed person to do some-\nthing that is good for him, and he will want to do exactly the \nopposite. People who behave in this way are childish and im-\nmature. When one is ripe with wisdom, then he is a truly ma-\nture human being. Age has nothing to do with it. \nA slave is a slave. No matter how he tries, he can't do \nwithout the thing he is a slave to. Never allow yourself to be \nenslaved by anything. You have all the will power in the world \nto break any habit. The power of divine will is always with you, \n"}

But you allow it to be eclipsed by \nyour bad habits and other wrong influences. \nWhen you make up your mind to do or not to do something, \nnever give in—unless you see you are wrong; then quickly \nchange your mind. Otherwise, don't give up, because weakening \nof the will takes away your most valuable treasure. Persons you \nassociate with may want you to be like them; but it is you, not \nthey, who will have to bear the consequences of what you are. \nThere is a story about the fox that lost its tail in a trap. He \ncalled a meeting of the other foxes and told them how won-\nderful it was to be rid of the tail. But one wise old fox got up \nand said, \"Mr. Fox-without-a-tail, would you advise us to cut \noff our tails if you still had your own?\" All the other foxes then \nsaw the trick. The moral is that if others want you to take on \ntheir bad habits, just say no. For example, if anybody wants you \nto drink, because he likes to drink, be firm: \"No thank you. I \nam very happy and having a good time without it.\" There is no \nreal fun in being drunk and behaving like a fool; and not even \nremembering, when you are sober again, how badly you be-\nhaved. Besides, drink can destroy forever your nerves, your \npeace of mind, and your happiness. \nSo never let anyone weaken your will. Others will test you, \nbut when you have made a resolve, keep your word. Above all, \nkeep your word with yourself. If you find that you are unrea-\nsonable, that is different. Then you must be able to change at \nonce and do that which is right. \nA Story of \"Won't\" Power \nWhen I like a particular food, I eat it until I decide to give it \nup. I don't create a dislike for it, I just leave it alone. For instance, \nas a child in India I used to like very much a small vegetable \ncalled patol. I would eat it morning, noon, and night. One of my \nfriends said, \"Don't you get tired of it?\" \"No,\" I responded. \n\"When I like it, I like it.\" He said, \"Then you are a slave to it.\" \nI thought, \"Maybe he is right.\" So I vowed that I would not \ntouch it for one year, and I didn't. You must develop that mul-\nish \"won't\" power by which you will not budge, no matter how \nyou are urged. Some months after I had made that resolution, \nmy friend invited me and other friends to dinner. Patois were \n"}

My friend said, \n\"We are sorry that you won't eat it.\" I replied, \"First of all, you \ndecided to test me. For me to give in and weaken my will would \nbe foolishness. And secondly, I have said that I will not touch \nthis food for 365 days, and as a result I have no taste for it. I \nenjoyed patois before, but now the wish for them is gone.\" \nRemember, you must get rid of every habit that enslaves you. \nAnd don't associate with those who in the guise of friendship \nwork with Satan to delude your will. Those friends who inspire \nyou are your guardian angels. Those who love God are your pro-\ntectors. If you want to be an artist, you should mix with artists. \nIf you would love God, associate with those who love Him. \nBy Concentration, Habits Can Be Installed at Will \nAs weak-minded people can fall into bad habits easily, so \nstrong-minded persons can learn to create good habits at will. \nHow? By concentration. I will give you an illustration. \nYears ago, in Boston, I was invited to someone's home for \ndinner. I was enjoying the meal very much until Roquefort \ncheese was served. I was very suspicious of those dark spots in \nthe cheese. But I saw that everyone else was eating and enjoying \nit. I took some cheese in my mouth, and suddenly my stomach \nturned and all the contents inside said, \"If you let Mr. Roquefort \nin, all of us will rush out at once!\" I was gagging, but I said men-\ntally, \"Be quiet. I am the boss.\" One of the guests looked at me \nand said, \"What is the matter?\" I didn't dare to open my mouth. \nI watched everyone else enjoying the cheese, and I said to my-\nself, \"I command my mind to establish immediately the habit of \neating Roquefort cheese!\" And I found that I was eating and \nenjoying it. To this day I am very fond of Roquefort cheese. Later \nsomeone suggested that I install the habit of eating Limburger \ncheese,- but I said, \"Nothing doing.\" I didn't see any reason to \ninflict its awful smell on myself and others. \nIntrospect to Know Yourself as You Are \nBe more serious about your life. Every night, introspect to \nsee whether you are being swept down the current of bad habits \nor whether you are developing your will power and \"won't\" \npower in order to be master of yourself. \n"}

You don't want to hide from your-\nself. You must know yourself as you are. By keeping a diary of \nyour introspection, you keep watch on your bad habits and are \nbetter prepared to destroy them. \nBut no matter how you have sinned in the past, never call \nyourself a sinner, because that is the greatest sin against the \nimage of God within you. It is better that you always affirm to \nyourself that you are a child of God, because that is what you are. \nAs soon as you say you are a sinner, your mind accepts that \ndecree, the will gives up, and you are done for.

That is why it was said of Jesus: \"Never man spake \nlike this man.\"* You cannot fathom the real nature of those who \nknow God, because they are depthless. My gurudeva, Swami Sri \nYukteswar, was like that. He was apart from everything. The \nteaching of being united with God, and thereby nonattached to \neverything else, is Yoga. \nThe Time to Create Spiritual Habits Is Now \nSince it may take eight years to form a habit, if you want \nto be spiritual, you must begin to cultivate the right habits \nnow. All of your life you have been restless for things of the \nworld. You sit to meditate and you become more restless. Then \nyou say, \"There is no use in meditating.\" But that is foolish \nreasoning. You have to live those eight years anyway, so why \nnot use that time to perfect your practice of meditation? The \nmore concentration you put into it, the sooner you will de-\nvelop that habit. Your mind will then be saturated with the \n* John 7:46. \n"}

To create a good habit, meditate; and then \nwith the concentration fixed at the Christ [Kutastha] \ncentre, \nthe centre of will between the eyebrows, deeply affirm the \ngood habit that you want to install. And when you want to de-\nstroy bad habits, concentrate at the Christ centre and deeply \naffirm that all the grooves of bad habits are being erased. \nI will tell you a true story of the effectiveness of this tech-\nnique. In India, a man who had a bad temper came to me. He \nwas a specialist in slapping his bosses when he lost his temper, \nso he also lost one job after another. He would become so un-\ncontrollably irate that he would throw at whoever bothered \nhim anything that was handy. He asked me for help. I told him, \n\"The next time you get angry, count to one hundred before you \nact.\" He tried it, but came back to me and said, \"I get more \n"}

While I am counting, I am blind with \nrage for having to wait so long.\" His case looked hopeless. \nThen I told him to practise Kriya Yoga, with this further \ninstruction: \"After practising your Kriya, think that the divine \nLight is going into your brain, soothing it, calming your nerves, \ncalming your emotions, wiping away all anger. And one day \nyour temper tantrums will be gone.\" Not long after that, he \ncame to me again, and this time he said, \"I am free from the \nhabit of anger. I am so thankful.\" \nI decided to test him. I arranged for some boys to pick a \nquarrel with him. I hid myself in the park along the route where \nhe used to pass regularly, so that I could observe. The boys tried \nagain and again to goad him into a fight, but he wouldn't re-\nspond. He kept his calmness. \nMake-believe Pleasures Cannot Substitute for the Bliss of God \nYou should wish for a thousand million deaths rather than \nenmesh yourself in bad habits from which you cannot free your-\nself. Money, sex, and wine were created as make-believe plea-\nsures. They could never substitute for the bliss of God. Even if \nyou do no more than pray sincerely to Him, His great joy will \neventually come upon you. Naturally, God wants to test you \nwith the taste of temptation and the lure of your bad habits to \nsee if you really want Him more than the enticing pseudo-\npleasures of the body. If you give in, you will get nowhere. If you \nkeep pouring water into a pot, you cannot expect the pot to dry \nout. You must dry up the water of bad habits in the sun of good \ncompany, wholesome activity, introspection, and will power,-\nand, above all, meditation and God-communion. No one can \nhelp you unless you are willing to help yourself. As I said, if you \nare willing, then God Himself will help you. \nWhen Jesus prayed to the Heavenly Father, \"Lead us not \ninto temptation, but deliver us from evil,\" he meant, \"Leave \nus not in the pit of temptation wherein we fell through the \nmisuse of Thy gift of reason.\" Temptation cannot lead us un-\nless we misuse our God-given reason. If once you taste the \nsweetness of God in meditation, you shall not be touched by \ntemptation anymore. You will throw off your bad habits and go \nafter Him. If you truly seek God, you will find Him. \n"}

Orien-\ntal Christianity taught plain living, outdoor living, meditating \non the lap of Mother Nature. Jesus did not preach a mode of \nliving far removed from the customary life of that day. Nor \nwould he today advocate a radical change in our routine of life. \nThis is a different age; the purposes of the Creator demand \nthat the world's evolution proceed through ever new and varied \nconditions.

This is the message—one of actual God-communion— \nthat will fill again the empty churches. People today frequent \nthe movie-houses, but the churches are comparatively empty. \nWhy? Because there is something tangible to interest and delight \nthe mind in the former. The Yogoda science of meditation will \nsupply this interest in the latter. It will show each seeker that \nthe most interesting thing in all the world is the Bliss-God \nwithin. It will give him the key to enter into this realm of un-\nparallelled joys. All the pursuits of life offer only partial happi-\nness, even if crowned with utmost fulfilment. But in finding God \nwe have the reservoir of perennial, unending, unsatiating bliss. \nFor He can give what the whole universe cannot give. He is the \nWhole; the universe is but a part of Him. \nKnowing God Scientifically \nOnce Occidentals know real communion with this great \nBliss-God, their whole attitude toward religion and the church \nwill change. No sermon will be dull then, no church empty. \nSeekers will hold the key to prove the truth of His existence. \nThey will be listening to words about One whom they have ex-\nperienced and know to be true, to be near, to be living. They will \nbe devotees of God because they have met Him, and not because \ntheoretically it seems that such a Being exists and should be \nworshiped. \n"}

Through family love, \nGod became the father to love you through wisdom, and He be-\ncame the mother because He wanted to give you unconditional \nlove.

Then \nI began to realize that my love was undergoing discipline; that \nI was to expand my love, not limit it to my family. God showed \nme that it was He whom I loved in my loved ones.

No territory belongs permanently \nto any country. The hand of time eventually erases all nations. \nTheir boundaries don't last, because they represent divisions \nthat have been carved out by force. I believe a time will come \nwhen in greater understanding we shall have no boundaries \nanymore.

The greatest blessing would be to develop \ninternational understanding by which we may realize this \ntruth. \nThese ideals should be taught in all the schools. Just as it \nwould be a sin to teach everyone to \"love your family; it doesn't \nmatter what happens to your country,\" so it is a sin to teach \nlove of country that militates against your greater world family. \nWhen in every school love of country is over-emphasized, it \nsows the seeds of misunderstanding and even hatred toward \nother nations. How dare we spoil children by teaching them the \nkind of patriotism in which there are seeds of hatred! Unless \nyou love your country, you cannot love the world; but children \nshould be taught also to love other countries as they love their \nown.

Bhagavan Krishna taught that \nbecause the wisdom in man is covered by ignorance, and be-\ncause man chooses to misuse his independence to nurture that \nignorance, he doesn't reflect the true image of God that is \nwithin him. But in all those who use the power of the mind to \nbe good, the power of Spirit will manifest. If we can receive \nthat power of Spirit, then we become true sons of God.

Beyond these three states is peace. If we can \nclear our understanding of all selfish prejudices—individual, \nfamily, national—we can reach that state of peace. \nJust think, if Hitler and other dictators and world aggressors \nhad had no personal or national selfishness, how many wars \nwould have been averted. I would like to see one qualified per-\nson attain to the presidency just for the sake of the country. Lin-\ncoln was such a one. I cannot think of him without thinking of \nhis aspirations for all mankind. But most politicians seek office \nfor their own advantage, and the advantage of those communi-\nties and causes that are closest to them personally. The love of \nnation of a Lincoln or a Gandhi is based on wisdom.

The sage Patanjali formulated \nthe Yoga system into eight steps for achieving the goal: \n1. Avoid unrighteous behaviour—yama. \n2. Follow certain moral and spiritual precepts—niyama. \n3. Learn to be still in body and mind, for where motion \nceases, there begins the perception of God—asana. \n4. While concentrating on the state of peace, practise con-\ntrol of the life force in the body—pianayama. \n5. When your mind is your own, that is, under your con-\ntrol through pranayama, \nand then you can give it to \nGod—piatyahaia. \n6. Then begins meditation: first, concentrate on one of \nGod's cosmic manifestations such as love, wisdom, joy \n—dhaiana. \n7.

In the light of my love I want \nto behold Thee.\" Then the Beloved of the universe responds: \n\"Though the world says you are lost, you are still My little \none.\" So remember, he who is mentally undefeated is the one \nwho finds God within the temple of his heart. \nNo matter what your obstacles, this you can do: In the se-\ncret sanctuary of your heart you can seek God; and you can \nlove Him with all your heart. Whenever there is a little time \nbetween duties, retire to the cave of silence within. You won't \nfind silence amidst crowds. Seek time to be alone,- and in the \ncave of inner silence, you shall find the wellspring of wisdom. \nThe Garden of Truth Is Found in God-communion \nI searched throughout India and found blossoms of truth in \nall teachings. But the whole garden of truth is found in com-\nmunion with God. Only when you hear truth from His lips \nwill you be fully satisfied. When you commune with Him, you \nwill know what you should do about any problems, and you \ncan truly say: \"I understand the will of my Father,\" or \"I can \nsee the love of my Father behind all that happens to me.\" By \nfeeling the love of God and following the love of God you will \ncome to love everything and everyone. You will be able to tran-\nscend all limitations,- for the love of God is the solution to life, \nto war, to struggle. \nI saw and felt this love of God in the true masters I met in \nIndia. I remember when, as a young boy, I saw for the first time \nMaster Mahasaya, a very great saint. * He was meditating, gaz-\ning into space into another world. He hadn't even spoken to \nme; but the instant I came into his presence I was entranced, \n* The story related here, and other incidents in Paramahansaji's relationship \nwith Master Mahasaya, are recorded in Autobiography of a Yogi, chapter 9. \n"}

First of all are the \"Thou shalt nots\": Don't steal, \ndon't lie, don't kill, don't commit adultery; don't commit any \nevil act.

After adopting the right methods of living, you must \nlearn to quiet the body and mind, and this begins with right pos-\nture. Always sit upright, with the spine straight. This is partic-\nularly essential for meditation. Mastery of the restlessness of \nthe body produces great mental power. \nThe fourth step is to switch off the life force from the body, \nso that the attention is freed for inner contemplation on God. \nYou cannot commune with God by emotional or muscular dem-\nonstrations.

Whence comes the peace you experience in \nsleep at night? Something cannot come from nothing. The an-\nswer is that God is behind the state of sleep. That peace felt in \nsleep, during muscular and sensory relaxation, comes from God. \nSo the masters have said we should practise pianayama, which \nmeans methods to control the life force in the body. \nPianayama brings results much faster than simple prayer or \nother methods of diverting the mind from sensory distractions. \nIn one life you can attain God-consciousness by Self-Realization \n[Yogoda Satsanga] techniques. Meditation, which is possible \nonly after achieving interiorization, is to experience consciously, \nwith the full possession of your mind, that state of divine peace \nand joy which you feel subconsciously in sleep. So the masters \nteach that by switching off the five sense telephones of sight, \nsmell, taste, touch, and sound, through pranayama, you can pro-\nduce that consciousness at will, enhanced a thousandfold. As \nevery mental state has a corresponding physical state and every \nphysical state has a corresponding mental state, the practice of \npianayama for Self-realization is aided by right eating, right \nthinking, right behaviour, and proper exercises to oxygenate the \nsystem. \nAfter successful pianayama, your consciousness becomes \ninteriorized. This interiorization is the fifth step. You will find \nyour mind fully alert and concentrated within, ready to enjoy \nthe divine peace and presence of God in deep concentration and \nmeditation, the sixth and seventh steps.

He who is \none with God is God Himself. Jesus proved this in his life. And \nyet, though one with all-powerful God, he humbly let himself \nbe crucified through the ignorance of certain men, rather than \nretaliate against them. As a son of God, a reflection of Cosmic \nConsciousness, he had dominion over all forces in creation, but \nhe never used his power against anyone. He who could raise the \ndead, who realized that his body was not physical but ethereal, \ncould certainly have saved himself from the cross. He said, \n\"Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and He \nshall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? \"t \nBut instead, he hid his omnipotence and allowed his body to be \ncrucified.

Everything is a part of Him, even the \nsmallest speck of dust. The wood that appears to be inert mat-\nter is the living light of God.

Creation was infinite in the beginning, \nand is infinite in the end. At the moment you are in the mid-\ndle, or manifested state, of that infinite change. Therefore you \nare infinite too; there is no beginning or end to you. \nIn this sense, nothing is finite; nothing is personal.

These are His great saints \nand avatars. \nTo cite again the example of Jesus, his body that was cru-\ncified and that he re-created, or resurrected, was manifested \nfrom the invisible God. And that resurrected form didn't die a \nsecond death, but was dissolved in Spirit after Jesus had ap-\npeared to his disciples. This demonstration proves that God \ncan make Himself visible and appear in any form at any time. \n* \"Those whose goal is the Unmanifested increase the difficulties,- arduous is \nthe path to the Absolute for embodied beings\" (Bhagavad Gita XII:5). \nt \"Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?\" [John 10:34, Bible). \n11 Corinthians 3:16 (Bible). \n"}

The Word* of God, the \nVoice of Spirit—the manifestation of the Infinite—is in every-\nthing. The disastrous upheavals that take place on this finite \nsphere are caused by human selfishness; by man's inharmony \nwith man, and with the hidden Spirit in man and in all cre-\nation.

We must learn this way to victory. Great leaders such \nas Napoleon, Genghis Khan, William the Conqueror, attained \nwide dominion over other men and lands. Yet their victories \nwere temporary. The victory that Jesus Christ attained is ever-\nlasting. How to achieve this permanent victory? You must start \nwith yourself. You may think it is hopeless to try to conquer ha-\ntred and inspire mankind to Christlike ways of love, but never \nwas the need so great as now. Atheistic ideologies are battling to \ndrive religion out. The world is marching on in a wild drama of \nexistence. Trying to stop the raging storms, we seem no more \nthan little ants swimming in the ocean. But do not minimize \nyour power. The real victory consists in conquering yourself, as \ndid Jesus Christ.

Yet the initial promise of scientific discoveries of-\nten fails to yield anything permanent. The beneficial effects are \nfelt only for a little while; then something worse comes along \nto threaten man's happiness and well-being. Total victory will \nnot come by applying the methods of science alone, because \nthese methods deal with externals, with effects rather than \ntheir subtle causes. The world will go on in spite of disasters, \nand science will again and again make new conquests. But only \nspiritual science can teach us the way to complete victory. \nThe Mind Must Remain Undefeated \nAccording to spiritual science, the attitude of the mind is \neverything. It is sensible to conquer extreme heat by the use of \nartificially cooled air, and extreme cold by artificially produced \nwarmth; but while trying to conquer discomfort externally, \ntrain the mind to remain neutral to every condition. Mind is just \nlike blotting paper, which readily takes on the colour of any dye \nyou apply to it. Most minds take on the colour of their envi-\nronment. But there is no excuse for the mind to be defeated by \nouter circumstances. If your mental attitude changes constantly \nunder the pressure of tests, you are losing the battle of life. This \nis what happens when someone in good health and with a good \nmind goes out into the world to earn a living and immediately \ngives in to failure when he meets a few obstacles. It is when you \naccept \nfailure that you aie a failure. Not he who is handicapped \nby illness, nor he who is constantly trying in spite of repeated \nsetbacks, but he who is physically and mentally lazy is the real \nfailure. The person who refuses to think, or reason, or discrim-\ninate, or use his will or creative energy, is already dead. \nLearn how to use the psychology of victory. Some people \nadvise, \"Don't talk about failure at all.\" But that alone won't \nhelp. First, analyse your failure and its causes, benefit from the \nexperience, and then dismiss all thought of it. Though he fail \nmany times, the man who keeps on striving, who is undefeated \nwithin, is a truly victorious person. No matter if the world con-\nsiders him a failure; if he has not given up mentally, he is not \ndefeated before the Lord. This truth I have learned from my \ncontact with Spirit. \n"}

If He doesn't know that evil exists, \nHe must be a very ignorant God! So, good and evil, the positive \nand the negative, both exist in this world. While trying to keep \nthe consciousness positive, many people become unreasonably \nafraid of negative thoughts. It is useless to deny that negative \nthoughts exist, but neither should you fear them.

He threw mus-\ntard seed at her, which was supposed to make the spirit depart. \nBut the evil spirit just laughed: \"I got into the mustard seed be-\nfore you threw it, so it doesn't work against me.\" Similarly, \nwhen the poison of negative thoughts has thoroughly perme-\nated your mind, the power of the mind doesn't work anymore. \nThe \"evil spirit\" of negative thoughts gets into the \"mustard \nseed\" of your mental force.

Come.\" I \nwent to him, and as I looked at his eyes I saw he was gazing at \nme with great divine compassion. \"Poor boy,\" he said, \"moun-\ntains cannot give you what you want.\" Suddenly, he touched my \nchest.

He wants us to use our \nfreedom to find Him, but He does not want to force Himself \nupon us. \nBecause God gave us independence, and because we mis-\nused it, we have become estranged from Him.

So also to understand spiritual truths it \nis necessary to have a spiritual teacher, or guru, one who knows \nGod. Even if you cannot be in his physical presence, or even if \nhe is no longer incarnate on earth, you must follow the teach-\ning of such a teacher if you would find God. Just any teacher \nwill not do.

I don't mind if I perish for \nYou, my God! But I must know You are here with me. How can \nI see You? How can I go on without You? I love to work. I love \nto help people, but not at the cost of losing You. Lord, my only \nthought has been to serve You in Your work, so why is it I feel \nI have once in a while lost Your contact?\" When I refused to \ngive up until He responded, the most beautiful answer came. \nThe Lord said: \"When you are not meditating, isn't it true that \nin your thoughts you are missing Me and thinking about med-\nitating? When you meditated you thought of Me, and when you \ndidn't meditate you missed Me; therefore the thought of Me \nwas always predominant.\" \n"}

Such is the \ndevotee's consciousness. \nYou must similarly pray until you get His answer. He will \nrespond to you, even as He responded to me. There is always \nsome particular desire lurking constantly in your conscious-\nness. Find out what is uppermost in your mind: Is it health, or \nmoney, or love?

When you have followed these two command-\nments, all others will be kept automatically. \nHe who is humble and loves God is the greatest of all.

It cannot be drowned or stabbed or shattered. * \nThe devotee realizes: \"I am not the body. I am formless. I am \nJoy Itself.\" Remind yourself of this truth each morning as you \nawaken: \"I am just coming from the inner perception of my \nSelf. I am not the body. I am invisible. I am Joy. I am Light.

Feeling an ever-increasing bliss in attentive \nmeditation is the surest sign of His presence. The greater the \nbliss, the deeper the contact with God. \nThere are two ways of experiencing bliss: by \nsabikalpa \nsamadhi and by niibikalpa \nsamadhi. \nIn the sabikalpa state, the meditating devotee becomes so \ninwardly immersed in bliss that thoughts, feelings, memory im-\nages, all sensibilities of the world, fall from the consciousness. \nJust as one who is deeply engrossed in reading an interesting \nstory does not see or hear what is going on around him, the \ndevotee becomes so absorbed in the enjoyment of bliss within \nthat his awareness is wholly absent without. It is not uncon-\nsciousness or a mentally chloroformed state in which there is \nsimultaneous disappearance of consciousness both internally \nand externally, but a supernal state of heightened inner divine \nperception. \nIn niibikalpa samadhi, or complete union, the yogi enjoys \nsimultaneously the transcendental bliss of the Absolute beyond \ncreation as well as Spirit's blissful omnipresence in all univer-\nsal manifestations—the unmanifested ocean of Spirit and Its \nmanifested waves of creation in the universe.

If you but once get to Him, then—just as the compass-\nneedle, no matter how you turn it, always points to the north \n—your mind will ever turn to the love of the Spirit. There are \nno words to describe that love. \nNo joy is real except that of the Spirit. But unless your heart \ncries for God, you cannot know Him. The hearts of worldly peo-\nple become dry as dust. Why? Because they cry for everything \nexcept God. You must cry for the Lord! Cry for Him who, if you \nwould but realize it, is already yours. The sole purpose of cre-\nation is to compel you to solve its mystery and perceive God be-\nhind all. He wants you to forget everything else and to seek Him \nalone. Once you have found refuge in the Lord, there is no con-\nsciousness of life and death as realities. You will then see all du-\nalities like dreams during sleep, coming and going in the eternal \nexistence of God. Forget not this sermon, a sermon He is ex-\npressing to you through my voice. Forget not! He is saying: \n\"I am just as helpless as you, for I, as your soul, am tied in \nthe body with you. Unless you redeem your Self, I am caged \nwith you. Dally no more, groveling in the mud of suffering and \nignorance. Come! bathe in My light.\" \nIt is because God wants you that I am here with you, call-\ning you to come home, where my Beloved is, and where Christ, \nKrishna, Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswarji, and the other \nsaints are. \"Come,\" the Lord is saying, \"they are all rejoicing in \nMe. No worldly joys—the taste of food, the beauty of flowers, \nthe passing pleasure of earthly love—can compare with the di-\nvine joys of My home. Come! Come! Come! Every night in med-\nitation you shall live with Me in eternal love. Remember Me! \nRemember My love!\" Thus the Lord is calling you. There is only \n"}

Here and there mist sparkled around these opal-\nescent mountains. A silvery river of silence, diamond-bright, \nflowed by. And there I saw, coming out of the depth of the moun-\ntain, Jesus and Krishna walking hand in hand—the Christ who \nsang by the river Jordan and the Christ who sang by the river Ya-\nmuna. Krishna with his flute and Christ with his song came \nhand in hand, and they baptized me in the river. My soul melted \nin the flaming-bright waters. The shining mountains and the \nriver and the sky all began to emit flames. My body and the bod-\nies of Christ and Krishna, the opal mountains and the glowing \nwaters and the sky all became dancing lights, and atoms of fire \nflew. Finally nothing remained but mellow light. In that Light I \nbehold all creation trembling. Thou art that eternal light of Spirit \nwherein all forms commingle. Thou art That.

However, when he practises med-\nitation he becomes once in a while calm, but most of the time \nhe remains restless. As he practises meditation more he feels \nhalf the time calm, half the time restless. And when he prac-\ntises meditation deeply and regularly, he is most of the time \ncalm and only once in a while restless. Finally he reaches a \nstate wherein he is all the time calm, and never restless. \nThe trouble is that you do not meditate long enough, and \nhence you fail to reach the state of complete calmness. But if each \nnight, when everybody else is asleep, your mind is praying to \nHim continuously like a steady stream, then God answers you. \nPray to Him, \"Lord, this life is Thine. I cannot live without Thee. \nThou must come to me.\" What is the use of praying unless you \nmean this?

The single eye of intuition and omnipresent percep-\ntion at the Christ (Kutastha) centre {ajna chakra) between the \neyebrows. The deeply meditating devotee beholds the spiritual \neye as a ring of golden light encircling a sphere of opalescent blue, \nand at the centre, a pentagonal white star. Microcosmically, these \nforms and colours epitomize, respectively, the vibratory realm of \ncreation (Cosmic Nature, Holy Ghost); the Son or intelligence of \nGod in creation (Kutastha Chaitanya/Christ Consciousness); and \nthe vibrationless Spirit beyond all creation (God the Father). \nThe spiritual eye is the entryway into the ultimate states of \ndivine consciousness. In deep meditation, as the devotee's con-\nsciousness penetrates the spiritual eye, into the three realms epit-\nomized therein, the experiences successively the following \nstates: superconsciousness or the ever new joy of soul-realization, \nand oneness with God as Aum (q.v.) or Holy Ghost; Kutastha \nChaitanya or Christ consciousness, oneness with the universal \nintelligence of God in all creation,- and cosmic consciousness, \nunity with the omnipresence of God that is beyond as well as \nwithin vibratory manifestation. See also consciousness, states of; \nsuperconsciousness; Christ Consciousness. \nExplaining a passage from Ezekiel (43:1-2, Bible), Paramahansa \nYoganandaji has written: \"Through the divine eye in the fore-\nhead, ('the east'), the yogi sails his consciousness into om-\nnipresence, hearing the word or Aum, the divine sound of 'many \nwaters': the vibrations of light that constitute the sole reality of \ncreation.\" In Ezekiel's words: \"Afterwards he brought me to the \ngate, even the gate that looketh towards the east; and behold, the \nglory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east; and His \nvoice was like the noise of many waters; and the earth shined \nwith His glory.\" \n"}

When Spirit manifests creation, It becomes the Trinity: \nFather, Son, Holy Ghost, or Sat, Tat, Aum. The Father {Sat) is \nGod as the Creator existing beyond creation.

The Holy \nGhost (Aum) is the vibratory power of God that objectifies or \nbecomes creation. \nMany cycles of cosmic creation and dissolution have come \nand gone in Eternity (see yuga).
