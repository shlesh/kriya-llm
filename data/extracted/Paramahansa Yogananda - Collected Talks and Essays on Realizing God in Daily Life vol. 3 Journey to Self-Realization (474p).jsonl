Many of the \nreligious and philosophical concepts and methods he introduced \ndecades ago are now finding expression in education, psychology, \nbusiness, medicine, and other spheres of endeavor — contributing in \nfar-reaching ways to a more integrated, humane, and spiritual vision \nof human life. \nThe fact that Paramahansa Yoganandaji's teachings are being inter-\npreted and creatively applied in many different fields, as well as by \nexponents of diverse philosophical and metaphysical movements, \npoints not only to the great practical utility of what he taught, but \nalso to the need for some means of ensuring that the spiritual legacy he \nleft not be diluted, fragmented, or distorted with the passing of time. \nWith the increasing variety of sources of information about \nParamahansa Yogananda, readers sometimes inquire how they can be \ncertain that a publication accurately presents his life and teachings. In \nresponse \nto \nthese \ninquiries, \nwe \nwould \nlike \nto \nexplain \nthat \nParamahansaji \nfounded Yogoda Satsanga \nSociety of India/Self-\nRealization Fellowship to disseminate his teachings and to preserve \ntheir purity and integrity for future generations. He personally chose \nand trained those close disciples who head the Yogoda Satsanga \nSociety/Self-Realization Fellowship Publications Council, and gave \nthem specific guidelines for the preparation and publishing of his lec-\ntures, writings, and Yogoda Satsanga \nLessons. \nThe members of the \nYSS/SRF Publications Council honor these guidelines as a sacred trust, \nin order that the universal message of this beloved world teacher may \nlive on in its original power and authenticity. \nThe Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-Realization Fellowship \nname and the YSS/SRF emblem (shown above) were originated by \nParamahansaji to identify the organization he founded to carry on his \nworldwide spiritual and humanitarian work. These appear on all \nYSS/SRF books, audio and video recordings, films, and other publica-\ntions, assuring the reader that the work originates with the organiza-\ntion founded by Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda and faithfully \nconveys his teachings as he himself intended they be given. \nYOGODA SATSANGA SOCIETY OF INDIA/ \nSELF-REALIZATION FELLOWSHIP \n"}

The year was 1931. As I stood at the back of the crowded \nauditorium, I became transfixed, unaware of anything around \nme except the speaker and his words. My whole being was ab-\nsorbed in the wisdom and divine love that were pouring into my \nsoul and flooding my heart and mind. I could only think, \"This \nman loves God as I have always longed to love Him. He knows \nGod. Him I shall follow.\" And from that moment, I did. \nAs I felt the transfiguring power of his words on my own life \nduring those early days with Paramahansaji, there arose within \nme a feeling of the urgent need to preserve his words for all the \nworld, for all time. It became my sacred and joyous privilege, \nduring the many years I was with Paramahansa Yogananda, to \nrecord his lectures and classes, and also many informal talks and \nwords of personal counsel—truly a vast treasure-house of won-\ndrous wisdom and God-love. As Gurudeva spoke, the rush of \nhis inspiration was often reflected in the swiftness of his \nspeech; he might speak without pause for minutes at a time, and \ncontinue for an hour. While his hearers sat enthralled, my pen \nwas flying! As I took down his words in shorthand, it was as \nthough a special grace had descended, instantly translating the \nGuru's voice into the shorthand characters on the page. Their \ntranscription has been a blessed task that continues to this day. \nEven after such a long time—some of my notes are more than \nforty years old—when I start to transcribe them, they are \nmiraculously fresh in my mind, as though they had been \nXV \n"}

I can even hear inwardly the inflections of \nGurudeva's voice in each particular phrase. \nThe Master seldom made even the slightest preparation for \nhis lectures; if he prepared anything at all, it might consist of a \nfactual note or two, hastily jotted down. Very often, while rid-\ning in the car on the way to the temple, he would casually ask \none of us: \"What is my subject today?\" He would put his mind \non it, and then give the lecture extemporaneously from an in-\nner reservoir of divine inspiration. \nThe subjects for Gurudeva's sermons at the temples were \nset and announced in advance. But sometimes his mind was \nworking in an entirely different vein when he began to speak. \nRegardless of the \"subject for today,\" the Master would voice the \ntruths engrossing his consciousness at that moment, pouring \nforth priceless wisdom in a steady stream from the abundance of \nhis own spiritual experience and intuitive perception. Nearly \nalways, at the close of such a service, a number of people would \ncome forward to thank him for having enlightened them on a \nproblem that had been troubling them, or perhaps for having \nexplained some philosophical concept in which they were par-\nticularly interested. \nSometimes, while he was lecturing, the Guru's conscious-\nness would be so uplifted that he would momentarily forget \nthe audience and converse directly with God; his whole being \nwould be overflowing with divine joy and intoxicating love. In \nthese high states of consciousness, his mind completely at one \nwith the Divine Consciousness, he inwardly perceived Truth, \nand described what he saw. On occasion, God appeared to him \nas the Divine Mother, or in some other aspect; or one of our \ngreat Gurus, or other saints, would manifest in vision before \nhim.

All we have to do is improve \nour knowing.\" \nThis book explores how to \"improve our knowing\"—how \nwe can experience the Divine Presence, within us and in all \nlife, not just as a passing inspiration but as a constant inner \nrealization.

As a spiritual engine, he will carry many \nsouls to God's kingdom.\" Lahiri Mahasaya was a disciple of \nSri Sri Mahavatar Babaji, the deathless master who revived in \nthis age the ancient science of Kriya Yoga. Praised by Bhagavan \nKrishna in the Bhagavad Gita, and by Patanjali in the Yoga Su-\ntras, Kriya Yoga is both a transcendent technique of meditation \nand an art of living that leads to union of the soul with God. \nMahavatar Babaji revealed the sacred Kriya to Lahiri Ma-\nhasaya, who handed it down to Sri Yukteswar, who taught it to \nParamahansa Yogananda. \nAfter graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Sri Yoga-\nnanda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable Swami \nOrder. Two years later, he began his life's work with the found-\ning of a \"how-to-live\" school—since grown to twenty-one edu-\ncational institutions throughout India—where traditional aca-\ndemic subjects were offered together with yoga training and \ninstruction in spiritual ideals. \nWhen in 1920 Paramahansa Yogananda was deemed ready \nto begin his world mission of disseminating the soul-liberating \nscience of Yoga, Mahavatar Babaji told him of the divine re-\nsponsibility that was to be his: \"You are the one I have chosen \nto spread the message of Kriya Yoga in the West. Long ago I \nmet your guru Yukteswar at a Kumbha Mela-, I told him then I \nwould send you to him for training. Kriya Yoga, the scientific \ntechnique of God-realization, will ultimately spread in all lands, \nand aid in harmonizing the nations through man's personal, \ntranscendental perception of the Infinite Father.\" \nParamahansa Yogananda began his mission in the West as \na delegate to the International Congress of Religious Liberals \nin Boston in 1920. For more than a decade he traveled the length \nand breadth of the continent, speaking almost daily to capacity \naudiences in many of the largest auditoriums in the country— \nfrom New York's Carnegie Hall to the Los Angeles Philhar-\nmonic.

To this day Sri \nYogananda's worldwide work is directed from this location (see \nphoto facing page 360), guided and served by monks and nuns \nof Self-Realization Fellowship, to whom Paramahansaji en-\ntrusted the responsibility of carrying on his work and preserv-\ning the purity of his teachings. \nIn the late 1930s Paramahansaji began to withdraw gradu-\nally from nationwide public lecturing. \"I am not interested in \ncrowds,\" he said, \"but in souls who are in earnest to know \nGod.\" Thereafter, he concentrated his efforts on classes for se-\nrious students, and spoke mostly at his own Self-Realization \nFellowship temples and the international headquarters. \nParamahansa Yogananda had often voiced this prediction: \n\"I will not die in bed, but with my boots on, speaking of God \nand India.\" On March 7, 1952, the prophecy was fulfilled. At a \nbanquet in honor of the Ambassador of India, Binay R. Sen, \nParamahansaji was a guest speaker. He delivered a soul-stirring \naddress, concluding with these words from a poem he had writ-\nten, \"My India\": \"Where Ganges, woods, Himalayan caves \nand men dream God—I am hallowed; my body touched that \nsod!\" He then lifted his eyes upward and entered \nmaha-\nsamadhi, \nan advanced yogi's conscious earth-exit. He died as \nhe had lived, exhorting all to know God. \nThe Guru's talks in the earliest years of his ministry were \nrecorded only spasmodically.

On the lotus leaf of material happiness the dew-\ndrop of life must remain untouched and unpolluted until it \nslips into the vastness of God's presence. How to express our \ninnate immortality in spite of contrary limitations is the pur-\npose of our subject on making youthfulness more lasting. \nYouth Is a State of Mind and Soul, As Well As of the Body \nEveryone is interested in youthfulness. In one way or an-\nother everyone is seeking the fabled \"Fountain of Youth.\" But \nwhat is youth? All young people are not necessarily youthful-\nsome are already old and jaded far beyond their years. In con-\ntrast, some elderly people remain youthful in spite of their ad-\nvancing age. They keep their minds young. Their smiles trickle \ndown from their souls into their bodies and faces,- their very life \nblood throbs with the joy of being. And then there are those \ndull, lifeless persons who are as good as dead before they die— \nand they don't even know it. They are the \"walking dead.\" You \nsee many people like that—negative, critical, moody, dispir-\nited. There is no excuse for a wrong state of mind. You must \nbe always positive-minded, cheerful, smiling, vibrant. By all \nmeans, practice this mental youthfulness that comes from the \ncore of your being. \nThus, the age of the body has no real connection with \nyouthfulness. It is the state of the mind and the expression of \nthe soul that make a person youthful. The definition of youth \nis that state of body, mind, and soul in which one feels the \nacme, the zenith, of joy and power. If you want to, you can re-\ntain that state indefinitely. Conversely, by carelessness you can \nlose it very easily. \nLet us first approach this subject from the mental stand-\npoint. The mind is the controller; that is, it is at the controls \nof this body. The body itself is designed by the mind. We are \nthe sum total of the consciousness we ourselves have created \nover a period of incarnations. * This mind, or consciousness, is \nthe supreme force that governs all voluntary and involuntary \nactivities of this bodily factory with its multifarious outputs. \n* See kaima and reincarnation in glossary. \n* \n"}

Accordingly, \nthere are five mental states: happiness, sorrow, indifference, \npeace, and true joy. \nWaves whipped up in the middle of the ocean by a storm \nrise high, recede into a hollow, and then rise again, one after \nthe other, until the storm ceases and the waves dissolve in the \nsea. Likewise with the mind. The mental peaks are life's alter-\nnating joys and sorrows,- the hollows in between are indiffer-\nence or boredom. These are the first three mental states. \nYou can usually recognize a person's mental state by his \nface. If you ask a person whose face registers happiness what has \nmade him happy, you will find that some desire had been sat-\nisfied—he got a raise, he accomplished something he wanted \nto do, or was otherwise gratified. A desire fulfilled gives joy. \nWhen you see a person with a glum or sour face, his ex-\npression tells you that he has met with some disappointment. \nA desire contradicted produces unhappiness. The desire for \nhealth is contradicted by pain; the desire for money is contra-\ndicted by poverty, and so on. \nThen there are the people in between. Ask them, \"Are \nyou happy?\" \"No.\" \"Are you sad?\" \"No.\" They are in the \nmiddle, neither on the crest of the wave of happiness, nor on \nthe clashing wave of sadness,- they are in the intermediate hol-\nlow. That is the neutral state of indifference. \nOne cannot remain indefinitely on the crests of either \nbuoyant happiness or turbulent sorrow, or in the dumps of \nboredom. In this world of competing dualities, the ordinary \nbeing is tossed up and down—rising on a wave of joy, sinking \ninto the trough of indifference, and then getting tumbled by a \nwave of sorrow. They little know anything beyond these \nstates of consciousness.

That can be attained only by con-\ncentration, mastery of the mental faculties. Even the most \nterrible sorrow is healed by time; nothing is gained by reliving \nit every day. Sorrowing for someone who is gone does not help \nhim or yourself, nor does it change that sad fact. Making your-\nself miserable by nurturing an inferiority complex or punish-\ning yourself for past mistakes or failures will not get you any-\nwhere; it paralyzes your mental faculties. Never allow yourself \nto get into negative mental ruts. And do not be bored with life \neither. That is a very uncomfortable state. It slowly stews \nyou. Don't bake yourself and your potentialities in the oven of \nindifference. \nBeyond the first three conditions of the mind—happiness, \nsorrow, and indifference—is the state of peace. Very few peo-\nple reach that plane. Those who have money and health and \nsatisfying relationships—everything they really need or want— \nmay say: \"I am not happy or unhappy or indifferent. I am con-\ntented; I am peaceful.\" After a period of turbulence, such a con-\ndition is welcome. But if for a long time one has peace that is \nmerely the absence of joy and sorrow, he will say, \"Please \nknock me on the head so I can feel if I am still alive!\" Such \npeace, being a negative state in which excitation has been \nneutralized, is not lastingly satisfying. \nSo now comes the positive aspect, the last or fifth state of \nconsciousness: the attainment of ever new joy. That state is \nfound only by contacting God in deep meditation, through the \npractice of such techniques as those given by the masters of \nIndia. That all-fulfilling joy will never grow stale. How to de-\nscribe it?

In \nmy childhood, I used to get angry at injustices. One day I saw \nhow foolish it was: I could not change the world in a minute \nby a display of wrath. I raised my hands and vowed: \"I will \nnever be angry again.\" Since then, I have never been angry \nwithin, though I can be outwardly fiery when necessary. \nWhen I came to America, twenty-some years ago, I saw \neveryone was drinking coffee,- so I tasted it for the first time, and \ngradually came to like it. Lest it become a habit, I made a rule \nnever to drink coffee by myself. Still, there were so many invi-\ntations that I found I was drinking coffee all the time. One day, \nas I ate alone in a restaurant, I realized I missed the coffee. I \nthought, \"So! You got me! All right: good-bye, coffee habit!\" \nThat was the end of it; in the past twenty years I have never \ntouched it. Just last night, some friends served coffee to me. It \ntasted all right, but it will never again be tempting to me. \n"}

I say, \"Go ahead, if you must, but remember that you will \nhave to pay for that bad behavior—no one else.\" Every wrong \naction goes against one's own well-being. It fails to give the \npeace and happiness expected. Sometimes it seems difficult to \nbe good, while it is easy to be bad; and that to give up the bad \nthings is to miss something. But I say you will not miss any-\nthing but sorrow. \nDo not be like the naughty child who wants to do the very \nthing he is told not to do. Everything that the great ones have \nwarned against is like poisoned honey. I say don't taste it. You \nmay argue, \"But it is sweet.\" Well, my reasoning is that after \nyou have tasted the sweetness it will destroy you. Evil was \nmade sweet to delude you. You have to use your discrimina-\ntion to distinguish between poisoned honey and that which is \nin your best interest. Avoid those things that will ultimately \nhurt you, and choose those that will give you freedom and \nhappiness. \nIn this new year, change your consciousness. Cultivate the \nright conduct and good habits that lead to freedom. When you \ncan say, \"I don't indulge in bad habits because they are against \nmy interest; I choose goodness of my own free will,\" that is \nfreedom,- and that is what I want for you. \nBoth Discrimination and Will Power Are Necessary \nRemolding your consciousness means exercising free will \nguided by discrimination and energized by will power. Dis-\ncrimination is your keen eyesight and will is your power of lo-\ncomotion. Without will, you may know what is right through \ndiscrimination and yet not act on it. It is acting on knowledge \nthat gets you to your goal. So both discrimination and will are \nnecessary. \n"}

The habitual inclination of \nour thoughts determines our talents and abilities, and our per-\nsonality. Thus, some think they are writers or artists, indus-\ntrious or lazy, and so on. What if you want to be other than \nwhat you presently think you are? You may argue that others \nhave been born with the special talent you lack but desire to \nhave. This is true.

I \ncould hardly drag myself here to you.\" \nLahiri Mahasaya replied, \"So, once more you indispose \nyourself.\" \nAfter some days of this alternating health and ill health, \nwhich followed exactly the expectation of Sri Yukteswarji's \nthoughts influenced by Lahiri Mahasaya's suggestions, my \nGuru realized the powerful lesson Lahiri Mahasaya had been \ntrying to teach him. \nThe Yogavatar said, \"What is this?

Thought is the matrix of all creation; thought cre-\nated everything. If you hold on to that truth with indomitable \nwill, you can materialize any thought. There is nothing that can \ngainsay it.

To give strength to creation as a reality \nby emotional involvement in it is foolishness. To not meditate, \nto not sit still and realize your true soul nature, but to drift \nalong as a part of the eternal motion of creation, is a constant \ndanger to your happiness. Perhaps some day your body will be \nterribly sick, and though you want to walk or do other things \nthat you used to do in your younger or healthier days, you \nfind you cannot do them; it is a terrible disillusionment for \nthe soul.

Now that is the \nway to take life.

When \nyour mind can remain anchored in Him, you will not suffer \nanymore,- no amount of disease or illness will be able to touch \nyou inwardly. Sometimes when this body gives trouble, I look \nwithin and everything vanishes in the light of God. Just as you \nsee the moving pictures on the. screen and enjoy the contrasting \nconflict between good and evil actions and between the joyful \nand sorrowful scenarios, so you shall be entertained by this \nworld.

It is easier to find \nGod in the jungle of civilization if you follow a balance between \nmeditation and constructive, dutiful work. Be like the active-\ninactive Lord.

I would rather \nbe somewhere sitting under a tree, absorbed in meditation on \nGod, or be busy serving others to make them comfortable with \ntrue peace and happiness. For although life is governed by a cos-\nmic plan, we have freedom to change our part in the drama. \nThe point is, if you learn to see this world as a picture \nshow, you will find nothing wrong with it. The only thing I \ncomplain about is that pain makes this picture seem so real. \nYou wouldn't mind your hand being taken off if you didn't \nfeel any pain and if you could put it back in place again. Some \nsaints have shown that this is possible.

God has given to us all the power \nwe need to do so. The mind is like an elastic band. The more \nyou pull, the more it stretches. The mind-elastic will never break. \nEvery time you feel limitations, close your eyes and say to your-\nself, \"I am the Infinite,\" and you will see what power you have. \nNo joy of the senses, no joy of possession, can match the \njoy of God. Though He had everything from eternity to eternity, \nHe began to think, \"I am all-powerful, and Joy itself, but there \nis no one else to enjoy Me.\" And He thought, as He began to \ncreate: \"I will make souls in My image, and clothe them as hu-\nman beings with free choice, to see whether they will seek My \nmaterial gifts and the temptations of money, wine, and sex; or \nwhether they will seek the million million times more intoxi-\ncating joy of My consciousness.\" The point that gives me the \nmost satisfaction is that God is very just and fair. He gave man \nfreedom to accept His love and live in His joy, or to cast it \naside and live in delusion, in ignorance of Him. \nThough all created things belong to God, there is one thing \nGod hasn't—our love. When He created us, He did have some-\nthing to attain, and that is our love. We can withhold that love, \nor give it to Him. And He will wait endlessly until we are ready \nto offer our love to Him. When we do, when the prodigal son \ncomes Home, the fatted calf of wisdom is killed and there is \nmuch rejoicing. When a soul returns to God, there actually is \nrejoicing among all the saints in heaven. This is the meaning \nof the parable of the prodigal son as told by Jesus. \nWatch Yourself From the Balcony of Introspection \nThere is so much more to life than what you think. Since \neverything earthly seems so real, how much more so must be \nthe Reality that creates this unreal reality! But the unreal real-\nity makes you forget the Real.

So I shall discuss today's subject \nfrom an entirely different standpoint—from the standpoint of \nscience and of metaphysics. You will see what a wonderful \nanalogy there is between the descension of the universe from \nGod and the ascension of the universe back to God. \nInherent in creation is the law of attraction. Celestial bod-\nies exert their gravitational attraction on one another; human \nbeings are subject to the pull of good or evil. Many persons \ntake to drink or to various other evil diversions; the saints are \nintoxicated with God. The man who turns from the church to \nthe bar in the village inn is drinking unhappiness, destruction \nof health, and loss of keenness of mind; but he who goes into \nthe church within himself and quaffs the inspiration of bliss \nthat flows from the vintage keg of silence is ever happy. So \ngoes the search for the Infinite. When you understand the law \nof gravitation, you can understand the best way to tune in with \nthe pull of God, and therefore the best way to find Him. \nGravity's effect is seen when two bodies are free to move and \nthey are drawn toward each other. Gravitation, according to phys-\nical science, is that attraction which exists between masses of \nmatter—by virtue of which every such mass tends toward every \nother mass with a force varying directly as the product of the \nmasses, and inversely as the square of their distances apart. That \nis, if the distance between two masses is one foot, the attraction \nwill be relatively strong; and if the distance is increased to two \nfeet, the attraction will be only one-fourth as powerful. \nThe law of gravity is universal, the same in the earth as in \nthe sun—and in all objects in space. The sun gravitates the earth \nand the other solar planets and keeps them whirling around it. \nThe earth gravitates the moon. The attraction of the earth for \nthe bodies on its surface is the same as the earth's attraction \ntoward the moon. The only difference is that the gravitational \neffect of the earth on the moon is reduced by the square of the \ndistance from the moon to the earth's core. \nThe mass of both objects, and the distance between them, \ndetermines the force of gravity. Gravity is not a one-sided \npull, but the pull between two objects. Just follow this analogy. \nIt will come to a beautiful spiritual understanding. \nImagine, for example, that here are two bodies.

The moon, by centrifugal force, is pulling away from the \nearth; but the gravitational attraction of the earth toward the \nmoon keeps a balance. It is evident that the same force of grav-\nity has given balance to the entire universe, so that the pull ex-\nerted by each object on every other maintains an orderly balance; \notherwise all things would have flown apart in infinite space. On \nthe other hand, if gravity were the sole force at work in the cos-\nmos, everything would have melted into one mass of matter. \nGod's Forces of Attraction and Repulsion at Work \nin Cosmic Creation \nWith a giant telescope, 6,000 stars were visible in one \nsmall part of space,- and though they seemed like little dots in \nthe sky, most of them are 100 times bigger than the sun! Just \nthink how immense God is, that the whole universe is con-\ntained in only a fragment of His being! The Lord seems to be \nhaving a lot of fun playing with these marbles in the sky. \nCreation came into being by the power of repulsion by which \nGod sent forth from Himself His creative forces. By this outgo-\ning creative power, God is repulsing us and the world of matter \naway from Himself, and yet at the same time He has instilled in \nHis creation the force of His pull to draw us back into Him-\nself—which is much greater. If God didn't pull us we would be \ncompletely thrown into matter for unending incarnations. \nFrom the study of theogony we learn that many ancient cul-\ntures ascribed the beginning of creation to the descent of gods, \nor celestial creative forces. The ancient Parsis, for example, be-\nlieved in the gods Ormuzd (or Ahura Mazda) and Ahriman, who \nevolved themselves out of primordial matter and were the two \ndeities who created, respectively, good and evil. The origin of the \nmaterial world is illustrated in the Egyptian notion of a cosmic \negg, made by the god Ptah, out of which creation issues. \nAccording to the Hindu belief, Brahma* is the eternal self-\n* The Sanskrit rendering of Brahma with a short a at the end, as in this con-\ntext, denotes God's all-inclusive Creative Consciousness, not the circum-\nscribed concept of the personal \"Brahma-the-Creator\" of the Brahma-Vishnu-\n"}

Spirit's consciousness as immanent in cre-\nation as the Creator is the world Soul out of whom all souls have \ncome. This Brahma, the transcendental ever-existing Intelli-\ngence, emanates a hierarchy of individual creative intelligences. \nIn the Sankhya doctrine of evolution of matter, we follow the \nchain of causes back to the principal creative intelligence, the \nunlimited eternal Primordial Nature, or Maha-Prakriti. Out of \nthis principle, or Original Nature, all existences have issued, and \ninto it they will return.* This primordial creative Nature is en-\ndowed with its own volition to carry out the development of cre-\nation. Its first emanation as plastic Nature contained the origi-\nnal Soul or deity, Prajapati, out of which all individual souls have \nissued—the first physical beings were called Swayambhuva \nManu (\"man born of the Creator\") and Shatarupa (\"having a \nhundred images or forms\"), just as Adam and Eve are the sym-\nbolic first man and woman of the Judeo-Christian tradition. \nThough the Hindu concept refers to the creative intelli-\ngences as deities, they are understood to be none other than \nindividualized aspects of the one Spirit. God transforms Him-\nself into these intelligences and then into matter and human \nbeings, just as our consciousness can transform itself into a \ndreamland wherein we can see and experience everything as \nthough it were real—human beings, earth scenes, plants, ani-\nmals, and so on.

God is pulling man and \nmaya is pulling man, and man is free to move toward either. \nGod and man, God and cosmic delusion, are all pulling on each \nother. God is pulling creation, including man, toward Himself; \nand material man and nature are pulling away from God. What-\never exerts a gravitational pull toward God is \"good.\" Whatever \npulls beings away from God is \"evil.\" There is a sort of balance \nwhen neither good nor evil predominate. But sometimes that bal-\nance is lost, as when man turns toward evil and pulls far away \nfrom God so that he feels less and less attraction to the Divine. \nBut no one can pull away from God completely. The stronger \ngravity of God will gradually draw the soul back to Him again, \nthough it may take innumerable incarnations to do so. \nWhen you shoot an arrow, it travels with its force until \nthat force dissipates and gravity causes it to fall back to earth. \nIn the same way, we were propelled from God, and our desires \nare the force that keeps us moving away from Him, coursing \nthrough the sky of reincarnations.

These first thoughts became positive and \nnegative, because no creation is possible at all without duality. \nWithout good and evil, light and shadows, only God's undiffer-\nentiated consciousness would remain. \nSo God projected out of Himself units of positive and nega-\ntive thoughts from which everything is created, just as a dream \n"}

First, a world of ideas came into \nbeing: the causal universe. Then those units of thought became \nlifetrons, the substance of an astral world of finer-than-atomic \nforces. * Then lifetrons became condensed into the material cre-\nation consisting of positive and negative protons and electrons, \natoms, molecules, cells, and so on. Atomic physics demonstrates \nthat all things in the material cosmos are made of atoms that \nvary in weight, density, power, size, and configuration and have \nwithin them the qualities necessary to inform the infinite vari-\neties of matter and life. But science has yet to recognize the \nlifetronic power and thoughtronic intelligence behind the atomic \nbuilding blocks that—in accord with God's cosmic laws wielded \nby Maha-Prakriti, Primordial Nature—combine them to produce \nmineral, vegetable, animal, and human forms. \nEvolution Versus Involution \nWhen God saw that He had driven these elements of cre-\nation out of Himself—from the finest to the grossest forms— \nthe process of involution began to work. From the standpoint \nof our subject today, think of evolution as going away from \nGod and involution as going back to God. For every process of \nevolution there is a process of involution. As God's creative \nthoughts assumed their grossest form in matter, then involu-\ntion began. The process of involution is going on all the time. \nGod's dreaming consciousness manifests first in the stones, or \ninert minerals. It then begins to stir in the sensitivity of plants, \nbut has no self-consciousness. Then come all forms of sentient \nlife in the animal kingdom. The innate vitality and conscious-\nness then finds expression in man, with his superior intelligent \npower to reason and discriminate. And finally, in the superman \nthe superconsciousness of God is fully reflected. Thus does \ncreation go away from God, and then come back to Him again. \nGod will give salvation not only to man, but to the planets, \nthe earth, the stars—everything that has worked so hard for \nbillions of years to provide a stage for a cosmic dream drama. \nGoing back to God by the involutionary procedure of Nature \nis a very slow process.

So many people try \nto win their points by argument, but I let them have a sense \nof victory right away. There is no use talking to them. \n\"Fools argue, wise men discuss.\" When we conversed with \nMaster [Swami Sri Yukteswar] it was a communion bound \nby pure reason and blessed by his wisdom. The masters \ncling to truth, not theories. But most people are enslaved \nby emotion and circumscribed by their own opinions. If \ntwo people really want to find truth, they can agree very \nquickly. \nIt is only by developing both pure reason and pure feel-\ning that you can reach God and truth. In the ordinary man, \nreason is uppermost and feeling is hidden; in the average \nwoman, feeling is uppermost with reason hidden. If you \nhave too much feeling, it becomes emotion and will take \nyou into the meshes of matter; and too much reason be-\ncomes rationalization which also takes you into delusive \nmatter. When you balance reason and feeling by medita-\ntion, you will come to God and truth-perceptions. By an \ninterchange of these qualities, man and woman can help \nto balance in each other pure reason and pure feeling, \nthus helping each other toward union with God. But mar-\nriage is not the only way. By successful meditation one \nattains this balance within himself, or herself, for it is al-\nready there, hidden in the soul. \n5. \nAfter developing the balanced reason and feeling of the dis-\ncriminative stage, the last state of involution is to be at-\ntained: the pure intuition and omniscience of the super-\nman. He is intuitively progressive in feeling his soul and \nSpirit. He must then fully lift his consciousness from the \nbody and materiality to his original omnipresent state. The \nfreed soul is back once more with God. \nYou can develop in yourself all these finer qualities by \nwhich God is processing matter once again into Spirit. You can \nhasten this process in your own body by spiritualizing it through \nmeditation and Kriya Yoga. You will see your body changing into \na mass of light, atoms of condensed electromagnetic energy. \n"}

According to how you apply \nthe principles of these paths, you are pulled either by Spirit or \nby matter. \nThe path of knowledge, \nor reason. If you program your-\nself with theoretical knowledge, you will become a walking \nvictrola, able to repeat lofty phrases and to be considered a \nlearned being, but your knowledge will be unsupported by your \nown realization or spiritual attainment. Such intellectualiza-\ntion keeps the ego tied to the physical faculties of mind and \nits relation to matter. Theoretical knowledge cannot give you \nrealization about God. So don't waste your time on too much \ntheory. Those who do so become lost in the jungle of reason \nand never get beyond mere theories. In the process of reason-\ning and reasoning they never perceive truth, for truth is beyond \nreason. Most intellectualists thus become bound by their own \nconclusions. \nIf you use your power of reason only to make money and \nseek material gain, again you will gravitate toward matter. \nSo the masters say: Do not use your God-given reason to \nbecome more and more mixed up in the labyrinth of matter \nand in the egoistic limitations of the intellect; with the power \nof discrimination, study and apply truth until it becomes your \nown intuitive realization. When you develop your intuition, \nyou will feel the presence of God and His omniscience within \nyou. That is called esoteric reason, or Jnana Yoga. \nThe path of devotion. If you have pure devotion, you will \nfeel the pull of God and will find Him. But again, there are two \npoles in this path also, two forces pulling you—devotion to God \nand devotion to matter. Even death tries to remind us that it is \nfoolish to be lured by material attractions. The miser is de-\nvoted to objects of matter and remains attached to them to the \nend, even though he at last has to leave everything behind. Yet, \n"}

But the yogi reasons, \"Matter is external and \npossession of its objects is short-lived. Why should I concen-\ntrate on the little temporal things and exclude eternity? Devo-\ntion to God alone is the only way to everlasting fulfillment.\" \nThe consciousness of the worldly man is circumscribed; \nhe is devoted to his body, his surroundings, and his family. His \nattachment says, \"Us four and no more.\" He should rather use \nthat family affection as a lesson in learning to expand his love. \nAs soon as you love not only your family, but give that love to \nall, you are going toward God. That is why Jesus said: \"Love thy \nneighbor as thyself.\" To use family affection for all, to give to \nthe world the same love you have for self and family, is gravi-\ntation toward God. Lessen the consciousness of family, prop-\nerty, and all material attachments and begin to reexpress the \nomnipresence you have lost. \nIn loving God, do not lose your devotion in emotion. This \nsometimes happens on the path of devotion. I was surprised to \nfind \"holy rollers\" in this country. It began with certain sects in \nIndia. But when devotion is expressed in physical emotion, the \npure quality of love is lost in the external expenditure of the life \nenergy in the muscles. When the body and mind gravitate to-\nward God, they become calm and quiet. The consciousness \nand life force become interiorized when one is inwardly with \nGod. True devotion is like a plummet that sinks into the sea-\nbottom of the perception of God. That is Bhakti Yoga. \nThe path of action. Some persons have a natural inclina-\ntion to be active; they love the motion of working and serv-\ning. If you work for your own self you are pulled toward mat-\nter. But if you work with the thought of doing everything for \nGod, you are pulled toward God. When your activity centers \nonly on making money for material advantages for yourself and \nyour loved ones, or on any activity with a selfish end, you are \ngoing away from God. Thus do most people engage their ener-\ngies in their attachments and their desires for more and more \nmaterial acquisitions.

When you are acting for God, you \nare linked to the gravitational pull of God. If your desire for \nmaterial things and for God are even, you will be more or less \nat a standstill. If your desire for God becomes greater, then your \ndesire for material things will be lessened. \nEngaging in spiritual activity consisting of both medita-\ntion and working with the thought that everything you do is \nfor God—that is Karma Yoga. When in meditation you feel \nGod's bliss eternal, you will no longer feel tied to the body, and \nyou will be filled with enthusiasm to work for Him. You can't \nbe a lover of God and be lazy. One who meditates and loves \nGod is always active for Him and for others. \nWork for God, Love God, Be Wise With God, \nand Realize Him Through Kriya Yoga \nSeeking union with God by wisdom alone, by devotion \nalone, or through action alone is one-sided. The far superior \nway is to take your mind and vital forces and all your desires, \nand your devotion and wisdom and service, and dissolve them \nall in God. When by Kriya Yoga you can withdraw your life \nenergy and consciousness from the five sense telephones, when \nyou can withdraw your vitality from your body and mind and \nthrow the searchlight of your attention on God, that is the \nhighest way to God. By Kriya Yoga, you shut off the senses at \nwill and take your mind and life and vitality and sensibility and \nplunge into the Infinite. The person within whom the aurora \nborealis of Spirit is dancing—whether materially he possesses \nmuch or no outward glamour at all—he is the real soul. \nSo, the easiest and best way to God is not to be limited \nonly to fnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, or Karma Yoga, but to com-\nbine them.

Thus, the destiny of each \nindividual is directed not by chance, but according to the causes \nhe himself sets into motion. By spiritual realization, every cir-\ncumstance of one's life can be scientifically traced to a specific \ncause or pattern of causes. But because the ordinary person does \nnot perceive how the law of action and reaction is governing his \nlife, he believes that what comes to him is in large part a mat-\nter of happenstance and fate. He often says: \"This was my \ngood luck,\" or \"That's my unfortunate lot.\" There is no luck \nthat one has not created before, in this or other incarnations; \nand there is no hapless fate except what has been \"predes-\ntined\" by one's own actions, here in the present or way in the \npast—sometimes many lives before entering the portals of this \nlife. These self-created causes are why some people are born \npoor and others rich; some healthy and others sickly; and so \non. Otherwise, where is the justice of God if He made all of \nHis children equal, and then consigned some to live in favorable \ncircumstances and others in unfavorable conditions? \nThe law of cause and effect that governs our lives is what \nwe call karma. Karma means action,- and it also means the \nfruits or effects of our actions. These effects, for good or ill, are \nwhat make it so hard for people to change themselves or their \ncircumstances. There is no other explanation for the inequali-\nties among humans that does not deny the justice of God.

Yes, there is. Reason and \nwill have been given to you. There is no difficulty that cannot \nbe solved, provided you believe you have more power than your \ntroubles, and you use that power to shatter your impediments. \nYou have to make the scientific effort necessary to succeed. \nSuccess Means to Create at Will What You Need \nThe typical concept of success focuses on having a lot of \nmoney. But real success means to have the power to create at \nwill what you need—the power to acquire those things that are \ntruly necessary for your absolute existence and happiness. It \nis important, therefore, to understand in what lies real neces-\nsity—to know the difference between needs and wants. If the \nperception of \"needs\" is boiled down, then the necessities for \na happy life can be easily met. \nThe ideal of balanced living is a middle path between the \nideas of the East and the West. The East says: \"Meditate on \nGod; never mind what you don't have.\" I think that is too ex-\ntreme.

There are destitute people whose lives are miserable; that \nis not the ideal of simple living. Simplicity means to be free of de-\nsires and attachments, and supremely happy within. It requires \na masterful mind and a very strong will to live simply. It entails \nneither hardship nor deprivation, but the wisdom to work for and \nbe content with what you truly need. To spend money on fool-\nish things, even if you have the means to do so, is weakness.

Their complete inner sat-\nisfaction is what you should create within yourself—to learn \nto be happy with whatever you have. Of course, modern living \nrequires more necessities than does residing in a hermit's hut. \nBut instead of carrying with you through life an attachment to \na lot of possessions, you should cultivate the power to acquire \nwhat you need when you need it. If you haven't that power, you \nare poor, no matter how much you possess. Even a Henry Ford \nor a Rockefeller may be said to be poor by that standard, be-\ncause needs do not consist only of physical necessities. No \namount of money can assure health or happiness. Prosperity \nmeans uniform fulfillment for body, mind, and soul. \nImagine, George Eastman, who invented the Kodak, had \nevery material thing that anyone could desire. Think of it! He had \nluxury,- but there was something wrong with his prosperity, for \nwhich reason his existence was intolerable to himself. Conse-\nquently, he ended his life by sending a bullet through his head. \nHappiness can never come merely from wealth and possessions. \nJesus Christ did not have any money.

They become enslaved by less important engage-\nments and forget their highest engagement with the blissful \nideal life of God-contact. \nBecause of the extensive use of machinery, Westerners have \nthis advantage over their Eastern brethren: they can use the \ntime thus saved to advance more in the deeper studies of life. \nBusiness activities and money are meant for the comfort and \nbetterment of man,- he should not allow blind greed for them \nto rob him of his happiness and the achievement of higher goals. \nSix full days and nights of machine-like existence, and part \nof one day (Sunday) for the cultivation of one's inner self, is not \na balanced way of life.

I may shake this piece of cloth and say it is \nnervous, but what is making the cloth move? When I cease \nmoving my hand, the cloth lies limp. You always blame other \nthings for making you nervous, but never accuse yourself. Yet \nit is you who make yourself nervous,- ninety-nine percent is \nyour own fault. Restlessness, emotional excitement, concen-\ntrates too much energy in the nerves so that they begin to wear \nout. After years and years, the adverse effects of that nervous-\nness begin to show. The nerves are very tough—God made \nthem so, because they have to last a lifetime—but it is neces-\nsary to give them proper care. When you stop overloading the \nnervous system, as when you are in deep sleep or a state of \ncalmness in meditation, you are not nervous at all. In medita-\ntive ecstasy the nerves become highly rested and rejuvenated. \nHealthy Nerves Essential for a Healthy Body \nNerves are like wires connecting all parts of a factory. If \nthe wires become worn or burned out, then the whole factory \nor certain affected areas of it cannot function. Similarly, the \nnervous system enlivens all parts of the body, including the \nperceptive, cognitive, and responsive functions of the five \nsenses. If the nerves are destroyed, then transaction with the \nworld is also destroyed. \nThere are two systems of nerves: the central nervous sys-\ntem in the brain, medulla, and spinal cord; and out of that the \nperipheral system, which connects the nerve centers to the dif-\nferent organs of the body and carries energy to them. The ner-\nvous system sends sensations to the brain, enables the brain \nto process them, and then reacts upon the brain's interpretation \nof those stimuli. \n83 \n"}

The brain is the house of government; \nthe twenty-seven thousand billion cells are the subjects. The \nnervous system that connects them all must be kept in proper \nworking order. You may recall the paralyzing effect of the re-\ncent telephone strike. That is what can happen in your body. \nWhen the nerve \"telephones\" are paralyzed, they cannot con-\nvey their vital messages. For example, if the optical center in \nthe brain is impaired, owing to wrong eating, disease, or strain, \nthe nerves of the eyes are affected, and the eyes begin to grow \nweak. \nExamine Yourself to See What Makes You Nervous \nMost nervous diseases are due to overexcitation of the \nmind. These arise from many causes. Examine yourself to see \nif you are nervous, and then determine what it is that makes \nyou nervous. When you get mad, for instance, you send tremen-\ndous volts of energy into the brain and the heart. Emotions such \nas anger and fear can so overload the nerves that they cause \nthe body to malfunction, sometimes even stopping the heart \nand causing death. If you pass a million volts of current through \na small wire that can stand only a few volts, the wire will be \nburned out. Excitement means you are directing too much en-\nergy to a certain area and depriving other nerves of that life \nforce. The man of calmness, on the contrary, keeps his nerves \nwell fed with a balanced flow of energy so that no part of the \nbody is detrimentally overloaded or depleted. \nNervousness is the disease of civilization.

Habitual \ntwitching—such as drumming the fingers or moving the toes \n—burns energy in the nerves. Another cause of nervousness, \nthough you may not be aware of it, is the noise of the radio or \ntelevision going on for hours at a time.

The more you can remain in that interiorized state \nof bliss in meditation, the more you will feel that joy with you \nall the time, even in the midst of activities. \nThe Spiritual Physiology That Makes Man Unique \nThere is a spiritual physiology underlying the nervous sys-\ntem that makes man a unique vehicle for the highest stages of \nthe evolution of consciousness. Man's brain, being larger than \nthat of most animals, with the exception of the elephant and the \nwhale, and being more complex, contains the greatest capacity \nfor thought. This makes the human brain a proper instrument for \nman, whose consciousness is the most highly evolved of all \ncreatures. Man alone is capable of advanced levels of discrimi-\nnation; and ultimately, of God-realization. The greater the \namount of thought (for example, in man as contrasted with ani-\nmals), the greater the complexity of the cerebral convolutions. \nThe fissures of these convolutions are about one inch deep in \nthe adult brain. The gray matter of the convoluted surface of the \nbrain is where our sensory-motor thought processes are lodged. \nIn early stages of the developing fetus, the brain is more like a \nmarble dome. The awareness and responses of the fetus increase \nwith the developing complexity of the convolutions. The mind, \nthe source of thought and discrimination, is a process of con-\nsciousness, not physiology; it triggers the physiology. * \nNow, you will find very interesting how God has made this \nphysical body. It is a deep and vast subject; so just a few points \nI will touch on. The gray matter on the surface of the brain is the \nreceptacle of nerve impulses. This is where all the nerve cells \n* In yoga science, the mind is conceived of as a conglomerate of interacting \ncomponents: chitta (consciousness; intuitive feeling), manas (the sensory \nmind), buddhi (discriminative intelligence), and ahamkara \n(egoity).Yoga \nteaches that the physical body, including the brain, is a product of conscious-\nness—not the other way around, as is held by some Western theorists. Yoga \npoints out, however, that in man's usual state of consciousness the mind is so \nidentified with the physical body that biochemical changes have a tremen-\ndous influence on the mind, which in turn reacts on the body through the \nmediums of the endocrine and nervous systems. This complex reciprocal in-\nteraction between body and mind is the major factor in man's physical and \nmental health. \n"}

As that part moves, another electrical \ncurrent is sent back to the brain via the sensory nerves.

It passes through \nmany evolutions in the relative stages before it reaches the ab-\nsolute state. For example, two people are discussing a business \nventure.

If you \nwant to find truth, your thoughts and actions must be true— \nphysically, morally, and spiritually in accord with the eternal \ndivine principles. \nTruth is the ultimate Substance. Let me first explain where \nthe presence of that Substance is to be found. Everything is \nlinked with Cosmic Intelligence—the tree, the sky, a bird, man. \nThat link is called Substance, the essential nature of all phe-\nnomena. It is the connecting link that makes of all manifesta-\ntions one Essence. This Substance or Truth is hidden; what you \nsee are only phenomenal appearances arising out of Substance \nby the power of cosmic delusion, or maya. \nThe Three Ways of Arriving at Truth \nNow, there are three ways of arriving at truth: through \nsense perception, through inference, and through intuition. \nIf your sense perception is wrong, your inference is wrong. \nLooking at the horizon you may think there is a fire, because \nyou see smoke; but as you approach the site, you find it was just \na cloud of dust. In order to apprehend the truth of anything, \nyou depend on your sight, hearing, smell, taste, or touch, plus \nthe power of the mind. These, however, could not be ultimate \nproof of the truth; because if the senses lie, the mind will lie. \nYour mind draws its conclusions from what the senses perceive, \nand the senses are extremely limited. Jesus therefore conveyed \ntruth to the masses in parables \"because they seeing see not; \nand hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.\"* \nThe ears are tuned only to certain rates of vibration. The \nhighest and lowest sounds your ears cannot catch. If the power \nof your hearing were sufficiently increased, you would hear the \nmagnificent sound that the universe is making as it rolls along \nthrough space. Everything is in motion and that motion is ac-\ncompanied by sound. Nothing is at rest, except in that tran-\nscendental sphere of Spirit where there is no vibration. Right \nwithin your body you can hear those vibratory sounds of cre-\nation, manifestations of the omnipresent Aum or Amen. But be-\ning of a higher rate of vibration, those finer sounds are audible \n* Matthew 13:13 (Bible). \n"}

You may think you \nhave found your soul mate, so you enter into matrimony; and \nthen end up in the divorce court. But intuition will never make \nsuch a mistake. It will not look at the magnetic power of the eyes \nor at the attractive face or personality of a person, but will feel \nand perceive accurately in the heart what that person is really \nlike. \nBy the power of intuition, which I learned to develop from \nmy guru, Sri Yukteswarji, I have never made a mistake about \nhuman nature.

If a stone hits him, \nhe is finished. Jesus proved by spiritual development a great \nscientific truth: the body is indestructible energy. It is not the \nphysical solid that it seems. * \nBy modern definition the physical vehicle of man is essen-\ntially an electromagnetic wave. If the body of a 180-pound man \nwere placed in certain acids, it would dissolve completely. Where \nwould it have gone? Seemingly evaporated, that body would \nhave become a mass of gases. Its total atomic weight would still \nbe 180 pounds. The only difference, when a body has been bro-\nken up into its component atoms, is that you cannot see it any-\nmore with the physical eyes; only scientific instruments can de-\ntect its presence as atomic vapors. The disappearance of the body \ndoes not mean that it has become nonexistent; it has merely \nchanged form, remaining hidden somewhere in the ether. \nMetaphysically, the body may be viewed as a thought in \nthe mind of God. It exists in His consciousness in much the \nsame way that it exists in our consciousness when we behold \nit during the dream state. Our dreaming consciousness creates \na body form out of concentrated thought and energy. It vanishes \nwhen our consciousness reenters the turbulent waking state. \nJesus had attained that consciousness wherein he knew by \ndirect realization that the body is only a mass of energy. Be-\ncause he had realized this, and not merely imagined it, he was \nable to resurrect his body after its crucifixion. Earlier, when one \nof his followers had cut off the ear of a servant of the high \npriest, Jesus put his hand on the wound and made the ear whole \nagain.t Modern science has yet to discover how this is done. The \nultimate goal is to realize that the body, and all else in this uni-\nverse, is essentially Spirit. The ordinary man is not aware of this. \nJesus the Christ was. \nOne needs to understand Jesus in the light of his spiritual ex-\nperience of the Cosmic Consciousness of the Heavenly Father pres-\nent in all creation.

He was Jesus the Christ. \nMore than three thousand years ago, before the time of Jesus, \nthere was born in India a great avatar whose family name was \nJadava. \"Krishna\" (or \"Christ-na\") was his spiritual title, and it \nmeans the same as \"Christ\": the divine consciousness that is \nomnipresent in creation. He was Jadava the Krishna.* \nThe scriptures tell of the wonderful powers of Christ and \nKrishna, showing that their consciousness was not tied to the \nbody like the ordinary man's. Jesus and Jadava had expanded \ntheir consciousness beyond the confines of the fleshly human \nform to include the universe—their cosmic body. They were at-\ntuned to the divine consciousness that is simultaneously present \nin every atom. It was not imagination,- they had become one in \nconsciousness with the Heavenly Father who is omnipresent \nand omniscient. That expansion of consciousness which Jesus \nand Jadava experienced had to be learned. All men can simi-\nlarly expand their consciousness to infinity, through devotion \nand scientific meditation on the Lord. \"God is a Spirit: and they \nthat worship Him must worship Him in spirit, \"t \nSo \"Jesus Christ\" means \"Jesus whose consciousness fills \nthe entire universe.\" When his friend Lazarus died in Bethany, \nand Jesus, in another place, said to his disciples, \"Lazarus sleep-\neth,\"t he didn't know this through any human informant. It was \nthe universal Christ Consciousness manifesting in him that en-\nabled him to feel himself present not only in his own body but \nin the body of Lazarus. He referred to this omnipresent Intelli-\ngence when he said: \"Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? \nand one of them shall not fall on the ground without [the sight \nof] your Father. \"§ \nIf you close your eyes and ask ten people to touch you, you \nknow exactly when and where each touch falls. God similarly \nfeels and sees everywhere in His great cosmos. Jesus Christ and \nJadava Krishna had attained that omnipresent consciousness. \nJesus therefore realized that his body was a creation of God's \nmind and, being in tune with that Cosmic Consciousness; \n* Reverentially referred to as Bhagavan (\"Lord\") Krishna, \nt John 4:24 (Bible). \ntjohn 11:11 (Bible). \n§ Matthew 10:29 (Bible) \n"}

Similarly, the difference between solids, liquids, \nand gases is only a difference in God's thought.

Because both are merely thoughts. \nSo once you realize, as Jesus did, that there is essentially noth-\ning in the universe but mind or consciousness, you can do any-\nthing.

The ego is the pseudo-self, the soul responding to \nthe world of duality while in a state of identification with the \nlimited instruments of the physical body and mind. For the \npurpose of discussion, let us say that anything you do for the \nbenefit of your self, either as the soul or the ego, may be \ncalled selfishness. In this usage, evil selfishness is that which \nyou think you are doing for the good of yourself, but which \ngoes against the interest of your true Self. Good selfishness, \nspiritual selfishness, consists of those actions by which the \npure Self within you can be realized; it helps you continu-\nously to manifest the perfection of that innate image of Spirit. \nSelfishness is characterized by different gradations. The \nactions of a child are performed more or less unthinkingly. \nWhen he sees somebody else playing with different toys, he \nwants to possess them. He wants to eat this thing or to do that \nthing because he sees someone else enjoying it. This is uncon-\nscious selfishness. I watched this reaction in my own child-\nhood. When I was very little and saw others playing with \nsomething, my first thought was to possess it. But soon I found \nthat whenever I wanted something, there was always somebody \nelse trying to get it or hold on to it. So I began to exert my \nstrong will to possess what I wanted. But when this brought \nabout fights with others, I wondered if it was right to assume \nsuch an attitude. \nMy mother used to say, when giving some special treat of \nfood to me, \"Share this with somebody else.\" Initially, my re-\naction was that she was trying to give me less.

Then came the thought, \"If I share with \neverybody, there will be nothing at all left for me.\" That be-\ngan to puzzle me. But my experience was that if I shared with \nothers, then I enjoyed more—the joy received from sharing was \neven greater than the joy I got from the thing I had shared. That \nis why I have always parted with whatever I have loved. When-\never some possession was wanted or needed by somebody \nelse, my mind would say, \"Well, he is 'sick' with this desire; \nyou were healed of your wish for it, so now let him have that \nbenefit.\" One by one I gave away everything that came to me— \nand my joy was multiplied. When I wanted something and got \nit, I enjoyed; and when I gave it to somebody else, I enjoyed it \nagain. No desire has ever been permitted to take possession of \nmy soul; that would be contrary to the ideal of spiritual self-\nishness for the welfare of my true Self. Never love anything so \nmuch that it possesses you. \nThe Idea of Possession Is a False Notion \nWhatever you give out, you will attract in kind.

But my mind says, \"You can't part \nwith your umbrella, even though you know he has admired it.\" \nThen I reason, \"He loved his stick, yet he gave it to me; so I \nwish to give him something I value.\" That is the spirit which \npredominates when a person shows unselfishness. \nYou cannot own anything. You are only given temporary \nuse of things on this earth. Sometime you will have to part \nwith them—either by accident or theft or deterioration or \ndeath. So when you try to hold on to or save anything just for \nthe sake of possessing, you are fooling yourself. \nEven this bodily house that you have lived in for so many \nyears must one day be relinquished.

Even if you have an enemy, he is your neighbor. \nDo not exclude anyone's happiness from the vision of your mind. \nIn marriage is a lesson in unselfishness. Two individuals \nlearn to share with each other. Then children come and the \nparents share with them. But it again becomes selfish if they \nthink only of their own little family: \"Us four and no more.\" \nIn time, loved ones will be taken away,- it is a reminder that the \npurpose of human relationships is to stretch the conscious-\nness by sacrificing for others and sharing with others. \nThere is so much happiness in being unselfish. It is the \ngreatest happiness, for in unselfishness you guard your own \nhappiness. My goal is the happiness of others for the happi-\nness of myself. You can never know the joy of that achieve-\nment unless by unselfishness you include others when you \nthink of your own happiness—not only those who are related \nto you, but all. \nLook at Gandhi. He had money, position,- but he gave up \neverything. And his wife followed him, not even demanding a \nfew bonds for the security of herself and her sons. They gave up \nall and lived for others,- having nothing, they have everything. \nGandhi has set a supreme example of humility and unselfish-\nness in this age. \nJesus said: \"Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased.\" * \nEgotism and selfishness must be destroyed out and out. These \ntwo kindred evils have driven from the earth the kingdom of God. \nThe world got away from spiritual selfishness, which takes care \nof the entire man properly, and fell victim to evil selfishness. \nBut you can help to reestablish that divine kingdom again, pro-\n* Matthew 23:12 (Bible). \n"}

Those who are your own \nwill never be vengeful or forsake you, even though there may \nbe disagreements. Those who were your true friends in other \nlives will have an unconditional love for you. No matter what \nyou do, they will always be your friends. Anyone who loves you \nunconditionally is someone you knew before. That kind of \nfriend you should be, also. \nIn analyzing who are your friends of past lives, you can \nalso tell by the attunement you share with one another. As you \ngradually concentrate your consciousness on developing true \nfriendship with another, you find that you begin to know how \nthat person will feel or respond, even before he reacts.

Do not mix with \npeople who flatter you, for someday such friendships will be \ntorn asunder; you will find that you have wasted your time on \nthem. Always beware of flattery. It is good to encourage oth-\ners with wholehearted praise and appreciation, but the insin-\ncerity of flattery is a poison that destroys the soul of both the \ngiver and the receiver.

And those who give flattery do not give love. \nIf you mix with people with real sincerity, thoughtfulness, \nand love, then you will attract those whom you knew before. \nOtherwise, you will never find your real friends. You have to \nbe rid of all hypocrisy and insincerity. And never willfully hurt \nanyone. Never antagonize your friends, or give them cause to \nbe angry. Never abuse or take advantage of a friend. Never give \ncounsel unless asked for; and when you do give it, do so with \nsincerity and kindness, unafraid of the consequences.

But evenness \nmust remain constant that it may serve as a foundation of your \nexistence. That is what Swami Shankara* taught: \"Be thou al-\nways of even mind if thou dost want the evenminded Lord to \nadorn the altar of your soul.\" Without that evenmindedness \none can never find God. \nJust stop and think how well Jesus Christ got along with \nhimself. That is how he could get along so well with the diver-\nsity in the multitudes. He behaved toward everyone and under \nall circumstances with the same evenness of mind, even dur-\ning his greatest trial of crucifixion. \"The relativities of existence \n(birth and death, pleasure and pain) have been overcome, even \nhere in this world, by those of fixed equal-mindedness.

When we understand them, we will know how similarly \nto pattern our lives. \nDeep Thinking: A Corridor to God and Intuitive Perception \nThe next point in getting along with yourself is control of \nyour thoughts. Learn to practice deep thinking. Learn the art \nof concentration so that when you put your mind on a partic-\nular thought your attention does not become restless, hopping \nfrom one idea to another. Most people live on the surface of \nlife. But it is by deep-sea diving in the ocean of thought that \nyou receive the pearls of knowledge. Deep thinkers are happy \npeople because they can get away mentally from the distur-\nbances of their environment. The average person has no escape. \nHe is always living on the surface like the fish that is easily \ncaught by the fisherman. \nBy practice, cultivate the habit of deep thinking. Take a dif-\nficult problem and ponder it. Go as deep into thought about that \nsubject as you can. If you go deep enough, a solution will be \nforthcoming. And in that inner depth, a sense of peace will \ncome over your soul. Why? Because in every deep-thinking \nstate is a corridor to the kingdom of God. Without deep think-\ning, concentration of the mind, one will never find the way to \nGod. Even profound thinkers who do not know God are never-\ntheless happy within themselves because they have made a \ndeep inroad into intuitive perception and to God without con-\nsciously doing so. Those who are capable of thinking very \ndeeply about different subjects, yet do not consciously connect \nwith God, may fail in divine perception because they became \nhidebound in their thought. No one can find God without con-\nsciously seeking Him. But deep thinkers are at least nearer to \nGod than those who live superficially in ignorance. There is no \nsin greater than ignorance. That is why I say, do not pass your \ntime in idleness. Do something useful in life, something worth-\nwhile, constructive, that will deepen and broaden your con-\nsciousness; and you will be nearer to God. \n* Bhagavad Gita V:19. \n"}

Deep thinking is a mental preparedness by \nwhich you can surmount circumstances in a divine way. \nCommon Sense Puts Deep Thinking Into Action \nAlong with deep thinking, you have to develop common \nsense—that is, sense that is common to all, an intuitive sense. \n\"Well, my husband was very sick, so I began to think very deeply \nabout it. And by the time I had concluded my deep thinking \nand decided to call the doctor, my husband had passed on.\" \nThat kind of thinking is not helpful! One must use common \nsense. It is essential that you know how to put your deep think-\ning into action. And no one can teach you common sense. It is \nan intuitive feeling that readily tells you what to do. Common \nsense is present in every soul, but very few people know how to \ndevelop their ability to tap that source of discrimination. You \nneed to cultivate that power by which you can find out the \nright course of action in any given situation. \nControl Desires and the Habit of Wasting Time \nLastly, in order to get along with yourself, you must con-\ntrol desires. So-called merriment means burning all candles at \nonce. No one has to chastise such people; they punish them-\nselves by their overindulgences, which create nervousness and \nanger and moods. They have no joy in anything because they are \ncontrolled by their insatiable senses. The true master is one \nwho controls his senses. When he says no to temptations, he \nmeans no. And when he says yes to right action, he means yes. \nNever kill time. It is too valuable to waste on useless \nthings. I never learned to play cards or checkers or any such \nthing because I saw they are just a means of killing time. Life \nis too precious to squander. God-consciousness has to be cul-\ntivated. Always be busy with God, then nothing and nobody \nwill be able to distract you. How wonderful it is to lead a sim-\nple life—a life of inner contentment is a heaven you know \nnot.

I am not see-\ning the movies, but the cosmic movies within. \nThe consummate purpose of life is to find God. So do not \nwaste your time in uselessness. \nGetting Along With Others Begins at Home \nWhile learning to get along with yourself, you should also \npractice the art of getting along with others—a great but diffi-\ncult art. \nBegin in your own home with the persons with whom you \nlive. There is a saying: a street angel and a house devil. If you \nlearn to get along with those in your own home, you will be bet-\nter equipped to get along with the rest of the world. You need to \ncorrect your own behavior and attitude. If you instead try to es-\ncape from those who rile you, your temper and passions will \nnevertheless cling to you; wherever you go, you will continue to \nhave difficulties. Why not cure your difficulties here and now? \nFirst of all, whenever you have problems with others look \nto yourself; blame yourself if that is where the fault lies. Do \ndeep thinking and see if your behavior is right; see if you de-\nserve the criticism of others. And remember, example speaks \nlouder than words. If you want to change someone else, change \nyourself first. If you want to teach someone else to get along \nwith others, set the example. Getting along with human beings \nmeans getting along with God, provided those human beings \nare not behaving unjustly toward you. Jesus was unjustly per-\nsecuted. But if persons justly \ncriticize you, that means you \nhave yet to make greater effort to correct yourself. \nDo Not Sacrifice Your Ideals to Please Others \nGetting along with people does not mean agreeing with \neverybody,- and it does not mean that you should sacrifice your \nideals for their sake. That is not the kind of getting along that \nI mean. But you can maintain your ideals without being offen-\nsive. In fact, from that standpoint, Jesus Christ did not get along \nwith many during his time. But he maintained his ideals with-\nout being repugnant. He certainly got along with himself, for he \nknew that what he was doing was right. And he said, \"To this \nend was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I \n"}

If you can live loving God and meaning no harm \nto anyone, and still the world wants to hurt you, that is all \nright. It is better to be cursed by the whole world and be a fa-\nvorite child of God than to be loved by all and forsaken by God. \nGetting along with others means getting along first with your \nconscience and with God, and then with people. \nThat realization is one of the great blessings I received from \nmy Master. There is nothing in the world that measures up to the \njoy that I received from his company. When you have the secu-\nrity of true joy, you have everything. You do not need the world. \nDuring my earliest years in this country, I was once invited \nas a guest of honor to a large party. I didn't know what an \"elite \ncocktail party\" was, so I didn't know what I was getting into. But \nI never before, or after, attended such a gathering. Everyone was \ndrinking heavily. Late into the evening, they asked me to speak; \nso I gave them a talk that I think they never forgot. I did not \nspeak in anger, but in truth: \"Is this your natural way of life? Are \nyou really happy embalming yourself in drink? This is not fun, \ngetting dead drunk and talking in an evil way. What is this?\" I \nknow many of those present made an inner promise never to go \nto such parties again. I was not mad, for I kept myself inwardly \naloof. In that way, I can get along fine with others. I do not have \nto follow their ways; rather I would try in a kind way to influ-\nence them to follow my ways. With God in your breast, joy in \nyour heart, wisdom in your mind, and all the power of heaven \nin your soul, you are in the joy of the Eternal Father. That is the \npower which I see and feel all the time. \nBehave in a truthful way that is not hurtful to others. If \nyou cannot get along with others because of your ideals, then \nit is best to get away from those naysayers. If your goodness be-\ncomes a torture to others, stay away from them. You should \nnot feel you have to beat others over the head with a club to \nmake them follow. If they do not want to follow you, let them \ngo their way. But always be willing to share your understand-\n* John 18:37 (Bible). \n"}

Make them happy. \nSmile From the Soul \nDevelop the habit of being pleasant. I do not mean that you \nshould smile always like a Cheshire cat. Such a smile means \nnothing; it is shallow. But a smile that registers deep in the heart \nand expresses itself in the face is marvelous. It comes from be-\ning sincere. Sometimes those who are much in the public smile \nin a lifeless, practiced way, while inside they are thinking of \nsomething else. There is nothing inside to make their smile real. \nBut the smile that reflects from the soul is very attractive; few \npeople can resist an individual with such a sincere smile. \nThere are some persons who are chronic sourpusses. And \nmany are hard-boiled, rigid in their reactions toward others. \nHow to get along with such persons? First, make sure that no \nmatter what the provocation nobody will be able to get you \nmad. That is one of the primary steps in learning how to get \nalong with others. No matter what happens, let no one get \nyour goat. It is difficult for those who have no self-control, but \nit is the easiest thing to do if you make up your mind. Do not \nboast that you never get angry, just practice it to the best of your \nability. If you proclaim it, people have a tendency to take ad-\nvantage of you. And do not be outwardly docile while seething \ndangerously inside. Under no circumstances let anyone make \nyou angry enough to do something that you will rue later on. \nMost people who lose their temper regret afterward what they \nhave done. Affirm with conviction: \"I have perfect possession \nof my emotions.\" Persons who do not have their emotions un-\nder control are their own worst enemies. Every unfulfilled de-\nsire rouses their ire. When anyone can make you mad, it is be-\ncause some desire within you has been contradicted. Otherwise, \nno one could make you angry. \nThere Is a Time to Remain Quiet but Firm \nIn your efforts to get along with others, do not be a door-\nmat or everyone will want to run your life for you. If they \ncannot dominate you, they get angry; and if you listen to \nthem and do their bidding, you become spineless. Then how \n"}

When you find resistance to your ideals, \nthe best way is to just remain quiet but firm. Say nothing. Do \nnot get angry. Verbal punch after punch you may get, but do \nnot permit it to provoke you. Refuse to quarrel. Eventually \nthose persons will understand that you do not mean to anger \nthem, but at the same time you have your own good reasons \nfor not wanting to do what they request of you. \nWhen people lose their tempers, get away from them un-\ntil they are calmer. If you can get together and talk out your \nproblems, it is wonderful. Communication is vital. But if any-\none just wants to fight, simply say, \"I am going to take a little \nwalk.\" Then return and be prepared to discuss. But if the per-\nson still wants to fight, go out again and take a longer walk. \nRefuse to fight. No one can quarrel with you if you noncoop-\nerate. Never supply more fuel to anyone's anger. The angry per-\nson is satisfied only if he can make you angry too. \nI can work with anyone, though I don't care to be with \nthose who don't know how to live in harmony. When some-\none has made up his mind to win a point, let him have the \nvictory—it is a hollow victory. Don't argue. Great men sel-\ndom argue; they smile and say, \"I don't think so,\" but they \ndon't fight. \nUse Tact; Persons Are Not Unfeeling Stones \nLearn to use tact with people. That does not mean you \nshould be a hypocrite; it means consideration of others. You are \nnot a stone; you are a thinking, conscious being, and you do not \nwant to treat others as though they were unfeeling stones. Do \nnot openly resist the desires of others. The person who always \nbusies himself with the affairs of others is both a cause and an \nobject of difficulties. If a person can take it, and if it will do some \ngood, then speak out. But sometimes the recipient does not like \nit and will defiantly do exactly what you don't want him to do. \nWhen you can get along with others, you are like a fragrant \nflower. As you pass by a garden, sometimes you smell the fra-\ngrance of roses or orange blossoms and you think, \"Oh, how \nsweet they are.\" That is how great souls are.

When someone has a \nmalodorous temperament of anger and quarrelsomeness, you \ndon't want to be around that person. Those who are always in-\nharmonious are of that type. They are like human skunks ex-\nuding an obnoxious odor. \nIn a religious organization, two classes of people are clearly \ndistinguishable—those who are trying to change themselves for \nthe better, and those who are quarrelsome and start trouble by \ntrying to change everybody but themselves. The latter seem to \ntake pleasure in trying to make others uncomfortable. \nI remember in the early days in Boston we were planning \na banquet. Two middle-aged ladies were real crackerjacks in \ngossiping. Unsuspectingly, I had given them charge of the ban-\nquet. But someone said to me, \"Beware of these two. They \nhave caused much trouble for other teachers.\" That put me \non guard to watch their behavior. As banquet arrangements \nproceeded, my secretary put place cards on the head table des-\nignating certain persons to sit there. These two ladies started \nfireworks: \"Why should these persons be on the platform and \nnot us?\" To restore peace, these guests were seated down at the \nother tables. \nOne day, these two ladies started disrupting organizational \nplans of the center. Their intention was to be the leaders of the \nwork in Boston. So I called them aside: \"Do you accept me as \nyour spiritual teacher?\" They said, \"Yes.\" I said, \"Will you lis-\nten to me?\" They said, \"Absolutely.\" They thought I was go-\ning to place them in positions of importance.

After a few days each one had \n\"secretly\" told many others what I had told her. When they re-\nalized what was happening, a feud broke out between the two \nof them. I then distanced myself from them. But they sought \nme out. I was in the Boston Plaza Hotel. They called me on the \nphone and wanted to see and talk with me.

By this means I have convinced you about \nyour wrong behavior. I told you something that was of no im-\nportance, just to see if you were capable of keeping a confi-\ndence or if you would give in to your habit of stirring up trou-\nble with your gossiping. The fault did not lie in the teachers \nwho have come to this town and whom you have criticized so \nfreely. The fault is in your own natures. I asked one thing of \nyou and you could not keep your word. Do you realize how \nyour reputation makes you disliked in this city? Now the trou-\nble you give to others has come back to hurt only you. If you \ncannot keep one promise of confidence given to your spiritual \nteacher, how can you expect others to have confidence in you? \nIf you don't keep faith with me, you won't keep faith with any-\nbody else. Are you truly at peace and happy within your own \nsouls?\" \nI was sincere with them, but I gave them that day a very \nhonest and earnest appraisal of their behavior. After doing so, I \nsaid, \"Now, I am not going to shut you out of my classes. But \nyou must promise me that you will not talk against anyone dur-\ning the class series. Do not think of yourselves as teachers. As \nlong as there is prideful desire to teach, you are not qualified to \nteach. First you yourself must live it. If you do that, others will \nfollow your example.\" And do you know that hour after hour \nthey attended the classes and didn't once disturb anyone. They \nwere the meekest of students. You see, I got along with them \nall right because I did not get angry. I used tact to bring them \nto the sudden realization of their mental weaknesses. \nBut getting along with others cannot be done only by tact. \nIt also requires example, calmness, evenness of mind, sincerity, \njoy, doing everything in an honorable way; not clinging to pride \nand egotism; and not governing your actions by what every-\nbody else does, but doing those things that please God.

But I said, \"Maybe \nnot.\" Then I cautioned him, \"Beware, you are making dire pre-\ndictions; but I say unto you that if you go on in this way all \nyour money will be taken away from you.\" He left Mount Wash-\nington and later joined another society; they flattered him and \n* Yogoda Satsanga annual-series booklets (see glossary). \n"}

Do not keep company with people unless you are \nprepared to give them your full attention. In that regard, when \nI am with others I mix with concentration, with attention, \nwith love. But when I am alone, I am alone with my God. Do \nnot make a habit of associating with people uselessly. When it \nis worthwhile, it is all right.

An analysis of the psychology of touchiness shows \nthat it is the result of misunderstanding, inferiority complex, \nand an ungoverned ego. Sensitiveness expresses itself in a lack \nof control over the nervous system. A thought of being offended \nruns through the mind and the nerves rebel against it. In react-\ning, some persons seethe inwardly with anger or hurt feelings \nand show no irritation outwardly. Others express their emo-\ntions in an obvious and instant reaction in the muscles of their \neyes and face—and often in a sharp retort of their tongue as \nwell. In either case, to be touchy is to make oneself miserable, \nand to create a negative vibration that also adversely affects oth-\ners. To be able always to spread an aura of goodness and peace \nshould be the motive of life. Even if there is good reason for be-\ning excited because of mistreatment, one who instead controls \nhimself in such a situation is master of himself. \nIt is a common trait of human beings to be touchy. And \nwhen this irrational emotion comes, it blinds the eyes of wis-\ndom. Even though the touchy person may be in the wrong, he \nperceives himself as thinking rightly, acting rightly, feeling \nrightly. It is when the scales of ignorance fall away from the in-\nner sight that one is able to measure exactly the good points \nand the weak points of oneself and others without the preju-\ndice and intolerance of the emotional ego. One then worships \nonly what is good, and remains transcendentally indifferent to \nwhat is psychologically unwholesome. \nMany persons think that they should pity themselves when \ncriticized, and that sensitiveness brings a little relief.

Be as firm as steel \nagainst sensitiveness. Never be touchy or harbor self-pity. \nAn oversensitive person frequently suffers in vain: gener-\nally nobody has any idea that he has a grievance, much less \nwhat it is. So he feels further hurt in his self-created isolation. \nNothing is accomplished by silently brooding over some per-\nceived offense. It is best to remove by self-mastery the cause \nthat produces such sensitiveness. \nIn my youth I was very sensitive; and consequently the one \nwho suffered most was myself—it was a process of self-torture. \nBecause I was so sensitive, others seemed to delight in \"getting \nmy goat.\" Your \"goat\" is your peace,- let nobody take away your \npeace. My discomfiture was not wholly the fault of the taunt-\ning of others; it was also the result of my own sensitiveness to \ntheir remarks. I found that the more I argued with people who \ncriticized me, the more satisfaction they got. At last, I made up \nmy mind that no one would be able to destroy my peace. I de-\ncided, \"Let them criticize all they want to.\" I remained indiffer-\nent to their unjust barbs, as untouched as if I were dead. They \nsoon lost their enthusiasm to pick on me; and many became \nmy friends and followed me. It is futile to demand kindness and \nrespect from others,- you must rather learn to merit it. If you are \nsincerely kind and respectful to others, and return any courtesy \nthey show to you, you will always be treated respectfully. And \ndo not paralyze the goodwill of others by being touchy when \nthey offer constructive criticism. Cooperate whenever anybody \ntries to help you. \nMy master, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, was very strict with me. \nHe watched every nuance of my thoughts and freely corrected \nme. He was harsh at times, but it was always for my highest \ngood. Many did not survive his sharp discipline; but I did, and \nwords cannot thank him enough for undertaking the task of \nmolding my life with his wisdom. Persons with well developed \nspirituality can clearly see the faults in others. When a clear-\nsighted well-wisher tries sincerely to help you, that person \nshould not be looked upon as one who wants to exercise lord-\nship over you, but rather as one who is trying to give you un-\nderstanding and strength to see and conquer your weaknesses. \nYou should cooperate.

I once said to a prince in India, \"Do you think these peo-\nple who court your favor really love you?\" He replied, \"Yes.\" \nBut I had seen them in a different light, and I cautioned him, \n\"Stop giving them money and gifts and you will find that they \nare not sincere. They mock you with their flattery.\" \nTrue love cannot be bought. To receive love, one must give \nit freely, without any condition. But instead of following this \nrule, the insecure person resorts to jealousy. This makes the \nloved one angry, and thus defeats its very purpose. Jealousy \nthen responds to the anger with a desire to strike back. But any-\ntime one wants thus to harm another, he ultimately hurts him-\nself even more. Evil acts have their source in evil thoughts; these \ncaustic mental parasites eat away the very fiber of one's being. \nThey burn and destroy inner peace—one's greatest wealth. \n\"Whatever Is Not Mine, Let It Go!\" \nWhy be jealous?

Expectation will make you a victim of misery. \nEven while striving to improve yourself, learn to stand \nalone, secure in your own virtues and self-worth.

If, for instance, it is the husband that is going \nastray, the wife should pray to God: \"Lord, help me to help my \nhusband. Keep all taint of jealousy and resentment out of my \nheart.

The Christ Spirit was born on earth in \nthe physical vehicle of the infant Jesus; within his conscious-\nness was omnipresent God. Behind the nascent brain of the \nlittle boy was the wisdom of Spirit. How else could he, as a \nyoung child, startle wise and learned men with his precocious \nwords? Even though the spirit of God becomes incarnate in the \nbirth of great souls, still those divine ones play the drama of in-\nfancy, youth, and all other phases of life and death. But it is to \nbe remembered that behind their mortal consciousness is the \nimmutable Christ Consciousness, the ever pure reflection of \nSpirit—which the sages in India call Kutastha \nChaitanya \nor \nKrishna Consciousness. This conception of Jesus very few \npeople have. If you know Christ in reality, you will know how \nto bring his universal spirit into your own consciousness. \nThe Proper Observance of Christmas \nWhat is the significance of celebrating the sacred birth of \nChrist on a certain day? It is not just to provide an opportu-\nnity for festivity and gift-giving. It is especially and distinctly \nto revive in our thoughts the inspiration of his perfect quali-\nties. If you hold a portrait before you, the image reminds you \nof the salient characteristics of that person; so is a day of re-\nmembrance, when properly observed. \nIt is sad when people forget the purpose of Christmas. Mil-\nlions are thinking only of the material side of this holy season. \nWe shall not be among them. Tomorrow, we are going to have \nour meditation day. From ten to six o'clock we will be medi-\ntating on Christ. To feel his presence and his consciousness is \nour purpose. Christ has remained unknown to men. They have \nkept the gates of their devotion closed, locked with material \ndesires, so that Christ cannot enter. When those portals are \nopened with love for Christ, he will come. I want everyone to \ntake the spiritual celebration of Christmas seriously. Our aim \nis nothing less than to bring Christ into our consciousness. \nThe Justice of God \nSt. John said, \"But as many as received him, to them gave \nhe power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe \non his name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of \n"}

What would be our position and \nour hope if the Lord made and equipped only one man, Jesus \nChrist, with the insight and will power necessary to conquer \ntemptation and attain God-union? Jesus was both human and \ndivine, as are we all. If this were not so, then his trials and the \npain he endured in crucifixion were just a farce. Rather, he was \na perfect type and an ideal model that all God-seekers may fol-\nlow in shouldering their own crosses. How could we be ex-\npected to overcome the myriad temptations of maya unless we \ntoo are made in the image of God and are as much chosen and \nloved by Him as was Jesus? The primary difference between Jesus \nand most other beings is that he conquered the tests that they \nhave yet to go through. He attained the divinity of Christ Con-\nsciousness by continuous effort and will power to overcome all \nmortal temptations and attachments. That Jesus was like us \ngives us courage and the desire to be like him. \nWhat an extreme test Jesus faced in surrendering himself \nto be crucified. Patanjali points out that even great saints feel \nattachment to the body on the last day, and are loath to leave \nit. My Guru [Swami Sri Yukteswar] explained that the hesi-\ntancy to leave the body at death is comparable to the experi-\nence of a long-caged bird that fears to soar out of its prison \ninto the skyey vastness. By his words on the Cross, Jesus re-\nvealed that he had to struggle to destroy the last shred of at-\ntachment to the body.t He fought his human nature and won; \nthat is why I see him as an ideal exemplar for all mankind. \nMillions of persons in this world have a charcoal mental-\nity, unable to reflect the divine consciousness that is in their \nsouls. You must become like the diamond, radiant with the \nsunlight of Christ Consciousness. If even one soul out of this \ngathering becomes enlightened, that is far better than if I were \nto speak to audiences of thousands who come just to hear an \ninspirational discourse. I know that some of you here have \n'John 1:12-13 (Bible). \nt \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?

But that does \nnot mean that you are truly in touch with him. The real visi-\ntation of Jesus is the communion with Christ Consciousness. \nIf you are in tune with that Christ, your whole life will change. \nThe Universality of Christ Consciousness \nThe love of God uplifts and enlarges us. I can never think \nof myself anymore as exclusively in this body; I feel that I am \npresent in all bodies. I have no awareness of race or other dis-\ntinctions at all. In my perceptions, just as I feel my own con-\nsciousness in every part of my physical form, I feel you all to \nbe a part of me.

God \ncould be cruel and destroy evildoers; in an instant He could \ndestroy the whole world. But instead, He is using love to bring \nerrant creation back to Him. Thus did Jesus teach: \"Love your \nenemies,\" for God \"maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on \nthe good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\"* Bha-\ngavan Krishna similarly said: \"He is a supreme yogi who re-\ngards with equal-mindedness...friends, enemies...the virtuous \nand the ungodly.\"! \nWhy should you hate anyone?

Make yourself im-\nmune with the antidote of love. \nRemember, your enemies, too, are children of God, and are \nloved by Him as dearly as you are. The Lord is like a mother; \nno matter how a child behaves, the mother loves it just the \nsame. Those who do evil have gone astray, and God wants in-\ntensely to bring them back to His fold. \nAnother reason you should love your enemies is that \ntransgressors for the most part are ignorant of their erroneous \ndoings, feeling fully justified in their behavior. No thinking \nperson wants to do wrong; most people simply do not realize \nthe error of their ways. They act on impulse, with no clear vi-\nsion or power of reflection. That is why they \"know not what \nthey do.\"* Such persons actually do great harm to them-\nselves, and therefore should be objects of our sympathy. \nIt generally requires far more strength and purity of mind \nto love than to hate. But a sage finds it easier to love than to \nhate, because he \"beholds his Self (Spirit-united) in all crea-\ntures and all creatures in the Spirit.\"! He sees all beings as a \npart of his greater Self, indissolubly bound together by the \nuniversal Christ Consciousness. \nTo bring divine awareness into our human consciousness \nwe must outgrow the limited conventional conception of \nChrist. To me, Christmas is a thought of spiritual grandeur— \na realization that our minds are an altar of Christ, the Univer-\nsal Intelligence in all creation. \nWho is the devotee that really knows what Christ is? To \nhuman vision he is the little babe born in Bethlehem, and the \nsavior who healed the sick and raised the dead.

Their leadership was \ngained and secured through demonstration of physical prow-\ness; the strongest and cleverest of the tribe became the leader. \nIn this way different clans developed. Gradually, to become \nstronger in order to accomplish common purposes, several \nclans united under one leader. Those leaders became kings, \nelected according to their demonstration of physical power and \nintelligence. But some of them abused their position and became \ntyrants. They further established that their descendants were to \nbe the successors to the crown. The right to rule by virtue of \nbirth, rather than capacity, vitiated this form of leadership. The \nevil crept in because even if the kingly offspring was physically, \nmentally, or otherwise unqualified, he nevertheless inherited, \nand usually insisted on exercising, the right to rule. In some \ncases, incompetent heirs were manipulated by scheming minis-\nters in their service. \nSo we see that the system based on inheritance was de-\nfective. Some nations eventually became weary of this kind of \ntyranny and rebelled against their rulers. Many kings were \nslain, and others dethroned. \nThen came the idea of a republic. Countries such as France \nand America chose to have presidents elected by the people. \nGeorge Washington qualified himself for this position by all he \ndid to help bring freedom to this land. He loved this country and \nhad its highest interest at heart; he was a real president. Under \nhis able leadership, this great land took its first important steps \nas a new nation.

If he goes against divine \nlaws he will punish or destroy himself. In the sense that God \nhas established inexorable laws, He does seem to be a dicta-\ntor.

How-\never, it is not enough merely to demand in another's language. \nOne should not rely on a book on love when he meets his be-\nloved, but should use the spontaneous language of his heart. If \none uses another's language of love in demands addressed to \nGod, he must make the words his own, by thoroughly under-\nstanding and dwelling upon their meaning, and applying to \nthem the utmost concentration and love; even as it is not \namiss when a lover addresses his beloved in the language of a \ngreat poet, and enlivens those words with his own love and \nfeeling. \nBlind repetition of demands or affirmations, without con-\ncomitant devotion or spontaneous love, makes one merely a \n\"praying Victrola,\" which does not know what its prayer \nmeans. Grinding out prayers vocally and mechanically, while \ninwardly thinking of something else, does not bring response \nfrom God. A blind repetition, taking the name of God in vain, \nis fruitless. Repeating a demand or prayer over and over again, \nmentally or orally, and with deepening attention and devo-\ntion, spiritualizes the prayer, and changes conscious, believing \nrepetition into superconscious experience. \nThe Divine Being cannot be deceived by a mockery of \nprayer, because He is the fountain of thoughts. He cannot be \nbribed at any time, yet it is easy to move Him with sincerity, \npersistency, concentration, devotion, determination, and faith. \n"}

These are harder to get rid of than ordinary \nchains,- for in their subtlety they are difficult even to recognize, \nnot to speak of how to destroy them! It requires a great deal of \nknowledge to cut those psychological restraints. \nThere may be a million years of actions of past lives pur-\nsuing you. That is why an ordinary individual finds himself so \nhelpless to destroy the binding effects of his karma.

You are thinking more \nof comfort and style than of mere warmth and necessity.

So your present consciousness and actions or be-\nhavior are influenced by this present-day society. \nThen the next strong influence upon man is nationality. \nThe soul identifies itself with the body and says, \"I am Ameri-\ncan\" or \"I am a Hindu\" and so on.

I am subtly telling you how to overcome your karma \ntoo: Always remain universal in your attitude and habits of life. \nThen you become free. \nThe soul has worn many garbs: today you are an American \nand in the next life possibly Chinese, and so on. That is why \nit is unwise to hate any nationality, for hate attracts just as \nlove attracts. Anything you hate, you attract to yourself that \nyou may learn to overcome that prejudice. That is the law. \nFor instance, those who hate a dark race will be born in that \nrace—invariably. The greater the hatred, the stronger will be \nthe karmic attraction to the object hated. The origin of the \nlight and dark races was influenced by climatic conditions. Cli-\nmate will so change that someday it will be natural to see the \nwhite races in the East and the dark races in the West. That \nwill happen; but many years from now. \nThen man is influenced by the community in which he \nlives. He is influenced by his neighbors: If he lives in an aris-\ntocratic neighborhood, he tends to behave in an aristocratic \nway; if he lives among businessmen, he behaves like them. Dif-\nferent kinds of people have different kinds of habits that influ-\nence you. Mix with artists and you will think that is the only \nway to be.

America seems very much a place where people \nconcentrate on keeping up their outer image in order to hide their \nage. I have seen many people looking forty who were really \nsixty.

It is an injustice to your po-\ntential as a human being to so regard your tests. The right atti-\ntude is to use each trial as a stimulus to strengthen your inner \nself. If the wrestler doesn't fight with stronger opponents, he will \nnot become stronger himself. So when you face all your dif-\nficulties bravely, with spiritual strength, you become even \nstronger and more powerful. By conquering when you are tested, \nyou will revive the forgotten image of God within you, and be-\ncome consciously one with the Father again. So we must re-\nmember to use our God-given strength to overcome our trials, \nand thereby strengthen our inner lives. That divine inner \nstrength is the source of our magnetism. \nThe Power of Good Company and Deep Attention \nAnother help toward developing your magnetism is deep at-\ntention: by this power you can draw on others' magnetism. Learn \nto put your full attention on everything you do. Whenever you \nare with someone, be a good listener. By attentiveness, tune in \nwith people who have those attractive qualities you wish to de-\nvelop. If you want strength, mix with those who are strong. If you \nwant to develop your business sense, be with businessmen. If you \nwant to develop all-powerful divine magnetism, mix with those \nwho love God. You will develop much faster this way than if \nyou merely read books on these subjects. \nSaints and others who have accomplished much in this \nworld have had great magnetism. By thinking deeply of great \nmen you can receive their vibrations. Ordinarily, we receive \nknowledge through the senses of sight and hearing: by reading \nbooks or listening to discourses. But greater than these is di-\nrect contact with a man of wisdom. You gain knowledge much \nquicker through such association. Even if that great soul lives \nten thousand miles away from you, if you think of him and con-\ncentrate on him with deep attention, you can receive his vi-\nbrations. You will begin to get something that is beyond mere \nwords: you can receive another's magnetism through the men-\ntal channel of thought. \nKrishna, Buddha, Jesus—these great ones manifested the \nhighest quality of magnetism. Every time I see an image of one \n"}

When \nI contact Jesus I feel the consciousness of God as the Father. \nWhen I think of Ramprasad, * I feel the vibration of God as the \nMother. This attunement with divine ones does not come about \nmerely by thinking of them for a few moments. It is only by \nmeditating day after day on a great saint that you will begin to \nreceive the spiritual vibrations of that saint. \nThere is also great value in visiting places where saints have \nlived. Assisi, the abode of St. Francis,- Bodh Gaya, where Bud-\ndha attained enlightenment; Jerusalem, where Jesus preached— \nsuch places are forever permeated with the vibrations left there \nby the divine souls who walked those grounds. Their vibrations \nwill remain until this earth is dissolved. Where souls have com-\nmuned with God, there you will find greater communion and re-\nsponse from God. Often such pilgrimages completely change \none's life for the better. \nDirect association with a God-realized man of wisdom may \nbe through personal contact or deep meditation. The impor-\ntant point is to attune your consciousness with his. When you \nare in tune with a great soul who loves God, that attunement \ngradually changes your life in a most wonderful way. Your will \ndoes not become enslaved; it becomes expanded. This is the dif-\nference between attunement to an ego-centered person and be-\ning in tune with a true guru. The magnetism of a God-realized \nsoul will put you in tune with the magnetism of God. \nGod Is the Supreme Magnetic Force \nJesus said: \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God...and all things \nwill be added unto you.\" God is the Supreme Power behind all \npowers; the Supreme Love behind all loves; the Supreme Artist \nbehind all art. When you put your mind on God, the Supreme \nMagnetic Force, you surcharge yourself with divine magnetism; \nand you can attract unto yourself all things. If you think of God \nin deepest meditation, if you love Him with all your heart, and \nfeel completely at peace in His presence, without wishing for \nanything else, the divine magnetism of God will attract unto you \n* A Bengali saint, Ramprasad (1718-1775) composed many songs in praise of \nKali, one of the aspects of the Divine Mother. \n"}

In every de-\npartment of my life I have demonstrated this truth: If you love \nGod for His own Self, not because of what He can give you; and \nif you are completely attracted by His divine magnetism, that \npower from Him goes out of your own heart and mind, and by \nyour slightest little wish, you will attract unto yourself the ful-\nfillment of that desire. If you have unconditional love for God, \nHe drops thoughts in others' brains, and they become instru-\nments to fulfill even your unspoken desires. \nSo divine magnetism, by which you can attract anything \nunto yourself, is the kind of attractiveness you want to develop. \nAlways desire that which is good, that which is noble, that \nwhich is pure. Then, as a divine man, filled with the magne-\ntism of God, you can never fail to attract anything you want. \nMeditate deeply, and send forth the call of your soul to \nGod: \"Lord, Thou must come into my body temple.

The divine man who loves God more than self finds \nthat the attractiveness within himself is God; he then loses his \nattachment to the gross body: \"O Lord, whether my body walks \nthe pathways of earth singing Thy name, or falls asleep in the \nocean of death, I am ever with Thee. Life and death may sing \ntheir songs, but I am one with the Song of Eternity. I cannot die, \nfor I am the Breath of Eternal Life.\" \nNow, please pray with me: \"Father, I have thrown off all \nnegative thoughts. I was bound by the iron chains of material-\nism, but Thy magnetic presence is changing me; I realize I am \nmade in Thine image. I am a divine magnet. Thy magnetic cur-\nrent flows through my hands; the magnetism of Thy wisdom \nflows through my brain, the magnetism of Thy love through \nmy heart, the magnetism of Thy joy through my soul.

God \nmeant us to be practical in this world—He has given us hunger \nthat has to be satisfied—but to go after only food and shelter, \nmoney and possessions, is to forget the true Source of happi-\nness.

Otherwise, God will have to \nsend you here again and again until you outgrow your ignorance \nand realize your true Self. Become so conscious of God that \nyou know He is the only Reality. The more you meditate, the \nmore that thought will be paramount. Try as it may, the world \nwill not be able to take that consciousness away from you. \nWhen I started my search for God, I shunned everything \nthat took my mind from Him, as though it were poison to me. \nI even avoided too much contact with people who were not of \nlike mind, because I did not want to be influenced by them. \nMilk will not float on water; it will mix, and become diluted. \nBut when milk is churned into butter, the butter can float on \nwater.

But those who fulfill \ntheir duty to man but not to God are like the mule that carries \na bag of gold on its back, knowing only its weight and not its \nworth. Actions without the thought of God are both burden-\nsome and binding; actions performed with the consciousness \nof God are freeing. Renunciation of material duties to serve only \nGod is all right, because it is to Him we owe our first allegiance; \nno duty could be performed without the power borrowed from \nHim. The Lord forgives whatever sins accrue from the nonper-\nformance of lesser duties by those who forsake all else for \nHim.* Renunciation means to put God first, whether one fol-\nlows the path of the world or the path of monasticism. \nMy brother said to me, \"Money first; God later.\" He died \nbefore he had a chance to find God or to use his money. Re-\nmember the words of Christ, \"But seek ye first the kingdom \nof God, and His righteousness,- and all these things shall be \nadded unto you.\"t When you find God, everything comes to \nyou.

That is what I have found. \nThe Right Attitude Toward Suffering \nThere are two kinds of seekers: those who are like the baby \nmonkey and those who are like the kitten. The baby monkey \nclings to the mother,- but when she jumps, it may fall off. The \nlittle kitten is carried about by the mother cat, content wherever \nshe places it. The kitten has complete trust in its mother. I am \nmore like that; I give all responsibility to the Divine Mother. But \nto maintain that attitude takes great will. Under all circum-\nstances—health or sickness, riches or poverty, sunshine or gray \nclouds—your feeling must remain unruffled. Even when you \nare in the coal bin of suffering you don't wonder why the Mother \nplaced you there. You have faith that She knows best. Some-\ntimes an apparent disaster turns into a blessing for you. \n* \"Forsaking all other dharmas (duties), remember Me alone,- I will free thee \nfrom all sins (accruing from nonperformance of those lesser duties)\" (Bha-\ngavad Gita XVIII:66). \n+ Matthew 6:33 (Bible). \n"}

Don't forget that. Sometimes, when the \nMother is going to caress you, a shadow is caused by Her hand \nbefore it touches you. So when trouble comes, don't think \nthat She is punishing you,- Her hand overshadowing you holds \nsome blessing as it reaches out to bring you nearer to Her. \nSuffering is a good teacher to those who are quick and will-\ning to learn from it. But it becomes a tyrant to those who re-\nsist and resent. Suffering can teach us almost everything. Its \nlessons urge us to develop discrimination, self-control, nonat-\ntachment, morality, and transcendent spiritual consciousness. \nFor example, a stomachache tells us not to eat too much and \nto watch what we eat. The pain from loss of possessions or \nloved ones reminds us of the temporal nature of all things in \nthis world of delusion. The consequences of wrong actions im-\npel us to exercise discrimination. Why not learn through wis-\ndom? Then you won't subject yourself to unnecessary painful \ndiscipline from the hard taskmaster of suffering. \nFinding the Divine Love Behind Human Love \nThere is suffering inherent even in the satisfaction de-\nrived from human love. Devoid of the quality of divine love, \nhuman affection is a blind alley that entangles and limits us. I \nrealized this when my mother was taken away by death. How \ndisillusioned millions of people have been who thought hu-\nman love was the only thing to live for. They were fooled, and \nthereby did themselves a great injustice. Where are all those \nthey loved and lost? What is the lesson to be learned? It is to \nlove the Love behind human love. \nWho is your father or mother but the Divine Father-\nMother who has taken human form to love and care for you? \n* The first Self-Realization Fellowship Temple, dedicated in 1938 on the \ngrounds of the SRF Hermitage in Encinitas, was on a bluff overlooking the Pa-\ncific Ocean.

The father's love is \nmore tempered with reason and law. \nThe Bible teaches: \"Honor thy father and thy mother....\"* \nBut it further commands: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God \nwith all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy \nmight, \"t When I say father or mother these words have an \nabsolutely different meaning for me now.

Such \nmistakes should be prevented from the very beginning. \nBalancing Feminine and Masculine Qualities \nIt seems there has always been a rivalry between man and \nwoman. But they are equals; neither one is superior. Be proud \nof what you are in this life. You are a soul that has been in both \nmale and female bodies in different past incarnations. If you are \na woman now and you envy men, you will have to reincar-\nnate as a man. And take heed: if you are a man now and feel \nsuperior to women, you may have to be born as a woman. \nMan argues that woman is emotional and cannot reason,- and \nwoman complains that man cannot feel. Both are incorrect. \nWoman can reason, but feeling is uppermost in her nature; \nand man can feel, but in him reason is predominant. The ideal \nis to balance reason and feeling in one's nature.

As such, man is meant to use that power to improve him-\nself and to get the most out of life.

The earnestly striv-\ning devotee knows that virtue is more charming than vice; and \nthat acting under the influence of good habits is more pleasant \nthan acting under the deceptively benign influence of bad hab-\nits. Good habits bring joy; bad habits bring sorrow. Habits of \nyielding to passions result in suffering.

Ap-\nply this law to your material, mental, moral, and spiritual life and \nyou will find it a complete, comprehensive definition of success. \nPeople think of success in different ways, depending on \ntheir aim in life. You even hear of it in connection with steal-\ning: \"He was a successful thief\"! This shows that not all kinds \nof success are desirable. Our success must not hurt others. An-\nother qualification of success is that we not only bring harmo-\nnious and beneficial results to ourselves, but also share those \nbenefits with others. Suppose a wife engages in the spiritual \npractice of prolonged periods of silence, and at such times re-\nfuses to talk even to her husband and children. Though she may \nsucceed in keeping silent, and thereby gain some degree of per-\nsonal inner peace, her behavior is selfish and detrimental to \nher family's happiness. She is not truly successful unless the ac-\ncomplishment of her good intention also benefits those to whom \nshe has a responsibility. \nLikewise, the attainment of material success means more \nthan that we are individually entitled to enjoy our prosperity,-\nit means that we are morally obligated to help others to cre-\nate a better life as well. Anyone who has the brains can make \nmoney. But if he has love in his heart, he will never be able to \nuse that money selfishly; he will always share with others. \nMoney becomes a curse to the miserly, but to those who have \nheart it is a blessing. \nHenry Ford, for example, makes a lot of money, but at the \n268 \n"}

Rather, he provides work and a livelihood \nfor many. If Henry Ford makes money by giving others pros-\nperity too, he is successful in the right way. He has greatly \nhelped the masses; American civilization owes much to him. \nEven the greatest of saints are not fully redeemed until \nthey have shared their success, their ultimate experiences of \nGod-realization, by helping others toward divine realization. \nThis is why those who have that attainment are dedicated to \ngiving understanding to those who don't understand. \nThus, if you find joy and pleasure in the culture of your \nmind to achieve true success, not only do you insure your \nown happiness, but that of others as well. \nA Different Standard of Success in East and West \nThere is a different standard of success in the East and in \nthe West. But the East is fast imitating the worst of what it sees \nin movies from the West. The storybook ideal of happiness that \nthe movies depict brings some solace to your heart; but when \nyou look at real life, you see that success is not so simple. Life \ncan often be cruel. You have to fight even to live. Think of all \nyou have to do just to feed the body and keep it strong and free \nfrom disease. Even if you succeed, that success is only tempo-\nrary, because eventually the body has to be dumped into the \nearth again. To have a successful existence you have to fight \nso many forces, within and without, that would rob you of \nworthwhile achievement. \nThe West concentrates on the partial or temporary success \nthat belongs to this present life. The East concentrates on the \ncomplete success that belongs to eternity. Those who have at-\ntained eternal success we call siddhas, * which means those who \nhave been judged successful by the Master of the Universe. \nSuch a one is completely happy in body, mind, and spirit. He \nmay have few or no possessions, yet he has great wealth—men-\ntal contentment, and spiritual understanding of the correlation \nof the soul and Spirit, and of the body and its essential relation-\n* Sanskrit, \"one who is successful\"; i.e., one who has attained Self-realization, \nunion with God. \n"}

In the West, you give your child a little bank and teach him \nto look to money for fulfillment. To strive for sufficient mate-\nrial means is good, but children should also be taught the value \nof success that will never fade. Soul wealth lasts forever in the \nbank of eternity, and you can draw happiness from it any time. \nBut even spiritual success can be one-sided, if you have ma-\nterial responsibilities and are unable to meet them. Only a great \nyogi who has freed himself from the laws of nature can com-\npletely ignore all material concerns. In the East, the doctrine of \nspiritual happiness was nurtured and material sufficiency was \nmore or less neglected. In the West, you have some physical \ncomforts, but very little mental happiness. What is needed is \nbalance between the two. If you only go after one thing in life, \nno matter what it is, you will become one-sided. For example, \nan artist may concentrate on his art to the exclusion of other \nimportant considerations. The result of this imbalance is that \nhe becomes nervous and unhappy. But art and God together are \na marvelous combination! Business and God, science and God, \nservice and God—such combinations make for all-round suc-\ncess and happiness. \nWealth on the one hand, and disease and trouble on the \nother, have numerous aspects.

But \ndon't congratulate yourselves too much about that; for here \nyou have worse things—such as unpaid bills and financial wor-\nries from living on the installment plan—that bite your peace. \nThere Is More to Life Than Mere Existence \nGod didn't create this earth as a place for us to just eat, \nsleep, and die; but to find out His purpose. A few wise ones have \nbeheld the divine schema, but so many others are blind and \ndon't see it. The earth becomes a torture chamber to those who \nlive in ignorance of God's plan. But when you use life's experi-\nences as your teacher, and learn from them the true nature of \nthe world and your part in it, those experiences become valu-\nable guides to eternal fulfillment and happiness. \n"}

My heart, \nmy brain, all the cells of my being were electrified, immortal-\nized with His Presence.\" Such is the love of the Lord. \nThe sorrow produced by hatred and war proves that spiri-\ntuality and kindness are superior forces. Hate is destructive,- love \nis the greatest constructive force. So, dear friends, from the stu-\npidity of hatred and the madness of war, learn to love God. His \nlove bestows an all-fulfilling success that nothing else can give. \nLove alone will bring fulfillment to the world. If all nations \nloved each other, and were anxious to help each other—not by \nforce and wrong methods, but by love and kindness—there \nwould come true and lasting worldwide success. \nThink of the billions spent on killing one another in war! \nShame on humanity! Where will it all end but in suffering and \ndestruction? The only way to bring this misery to an end is by \nlove. As long as one nation builds bigger weapons for defense, \nother nations will try to find even better methods to defend \nthemselves, and people will live in constant terror. Why don't \nall nations cultivate love and understanding instead of hatred \nand war? \nA universal religion of love is the real answer. Love makes \nother dharmas (duties), remember Me alone; I will free thee from all sins (ac-\ncruing from nonperformance of those lesser duties)\" (Bhagavad Gita XVIII:66). \n* Bhagavad Gita VI:30, as frequently paraphrased by Paramahansaji, who has \ngiven this literal translation: \"He who perceives Me everywhere and beholds \neverything in Me never loses sight of Me, nor do I ever lose sight of him.\" \n"}

You may \nwant to believe; you may even think you believe; but if you \nreally believe, the result will be instantaneous. \nThere are various degrees of belief. Some people don't be-\nlieve at all. Some want to believe, others believe a little bit, and \nsome believe until their belief is tested. We are so certain of \nour convictions, until they are contradicted; then we become \nconfused and insecure. Faith is intuitive conviction, a knowing \nfrom the soul, that cannot be shaken even by contradictions. \nThe practical purpose behind the scriptural injunction to \nseek God first is that once you have found Him, you can use His \npower to acquire the things your common sense tells you are \nright for you to have.

Do not think that in order to be well-clothed and fed you have \nto have millions—you don't have to lead a sophisticated life in \norder merely to feed and care for the bodily animal.

Concentrate upon making yourself proficient in that. \nMany try ten kinds of endeavor without getting really ac-\nquainted with any.

Yet with the march of human progress, our world is be-\ncoming small—every day it is growing smaller, due to modern \ntransportation facilities.

I grew that tree in twelve years.\" And \nyou could see that the tree was already bearing walnuts! \nIf the walnut tree can be made to mature in twelve years \ninstead of one hundred and fifty years, there is a chance for \nhuman beings also. In sixty years of existence, it is possible \nfor a human being to develop so that he can be a center of all \nknowledge. That is the point I want to drive home in your \nmind. I have cited how machinery hastened world evolution. \nWhere did machinery come from?—from the factory of hu-\nman minds. As man quickened evolution in society and busi-\nness, so he can quicken his evolution in all branches of his \nlife, including the faculties of his inner life. \nBurbank also made almonds have soft shells, made over the \ntomato, and created the Shasta daisy from bulbs and the cactus \nwithout thorns. In primitive times the different animals used \nto eat the cactus, so the cactus developed protective thorns. \nWhen one life begins to hurt another life, that life develops \nweapons of defense. Burbank told me that during his experi-\nments in developing the spineless cactus, every day he went \ninto the garden and talked to the barbed plants: \"Please, beloved \ncactus, I am Luther Burbank, your friend. I am not going to \nhurt you at all, so why develop thorns?\" And so the thornless \ncactus was developed. By talking, by attention, by thought-force \nand knowledge of nature's laws, you can impress certain vibra-\ntions on protoplasm, and thus consciously guide and hasten \nthe process of evolution. \nIncreasing the Receptivity of the Brain \nProfessor James of Harvard said that most of our habits \ncome through heredity. Feeblemindedness in people, science \nsays, cannot be helped. Scientists take measurements and be-\nlieve too much in the stamp of heredity. They have yet to learn \nhow by awakening the brain cells man can quicken his evolu-\ntion. The power of receptivity of the brain cells can become so \nheightened that a man can receive, in a single lifetime, all the \nknowledge he wants to absorb within himself. \nIn education there is a vast difference between the meth-\nods applied by teachers in India and in the West.

After \nsome deep thought he said, \"I did not study that. It was not in \nmy curriculum.\" Using common sense was beyond him. \nIt is not a pumping-in from the outside that gives wis-\ndom; it is the power and extent of your inner receptivity that \ndetermines how much you can attain of true knowledge, and \nhow rapidly. The man who has the power of receptivity quickly \ngrasps everything. People with no receptivity may be exposed \nto the same experiences or information, yet not really see nor \nfully comprehend what is there. An intelligent man lives far \nahead of the idiot. Your experiences bring wisdom according \nto the measure of the cup of your receptivity. \nFocused Concentration Makes You Keenly Receptive \nto Wisdom \nHow can you increase your receptivity, and thus quicken \nyour evolution? By consciously condensing all your experiences \nthrough the power of concentration. Concentration means to \ngather in your attention, focusing it to one point; condensa-\ntion means to use that concentrated attention to do something \nquickly that ordinarily would take a long time. By concentra-\ntion you can condense each experience and garner whatever \nwisdom is to be learned from it. By condensation of individual \nexperiences you can compress all your experiences, and the wis-\ndom they contain, into a shorter length of time and thus gain \nmuch more than if you go through life haphazardly. \nI will tell you of such an experience. A friend of mine said \nI was all right as a spiritual man, but that I could not succeed \nin business. I replied, \"I am going to make five thousand dol-\nlars in business for you, within two weeks.\" He said, \"You will \nhave to show me. I am 'from Missouri.'\" \nI did not rush to invest money on unwise things. I used \nconcentration, disengaged my mind from all disturbances, and \nfocused my attention one-pointedly within.

He sold the houses and had a clear \nprofit of five thousand dollars. I showed him that the power of \nGod works through the mind wherever we apply it with faith. \nConcentration, when directed by Divine Power, does not \nallow you to ramble through wrong investments; you go \nstraight to success. If that mind power can be applied in busi-\nness it can be applied in other things—in music and writing, \nfor example. I always start from within to bring knowledge out, \nand not from without to pump knowledge in. All the musical \ninstruments I play I learned that way. Perhaps I was too proud \nto think about going to a teacher; I thought, \"Well, the first \nman who started to make music did not learn from anybody,-\nwhy can't I do the same?\" (It is all right to say that, but if you \nstand and wait while you reinvent the trolley car, you will be \na long time getting to your destination!) \nAll questions I have had have been answered; as fast as \nGod can respond, I receive direct replies from Him.

It blocks receptivity to the benef-\nicent workings of higher forces and laws in the universe, and \nto the ever-ready-to-help grace of God. It produces an inner dis-\nquietude and sense of hopelessness. It resists progress and re-\njects ideas on the whims of ignorance, prejudice, or emotion. \nBut let us consider the constructive element of doubt. \nIf Man Could Not Doubt, He Could Not Progress \nThe predominance of matter before our eyes in the form of \nobjects and beings prevents our perception of the whole of \ntruth. It is by doubting the preeminence of matter that the ex-\nistence of God is established. If matter, a conglomeration of \natoms, is all there is, then how do these invisible particles hold \na parliament and bring forth and govern such an organized uni-\nverse? It is impossible that inanimate atoms could put them-\nselves together and produce intelligent beings. So the acceptance \nof God, an Intelligent Consciousness as the creator of this world, \nwas established from materialism by applying the constructive, \nprogressive element of doubt. This constructive element is the \nscientific current of thought by which we question in order to \nknow what is true. Without this, if we merely accepted things \nas they appear to be, man would become as animals. Some an-\ncient civilizations held the view that the sun, moon, and stars \nwere deities governing their lives. Man outgrew that concept \nby the process of doubt. Through constructive questioning, \nsuch belief was found to be wanting. If man could not doubt, he \ncould not progress,- the world would be mired in ignorance. We \nwould not be able to differentiate theory or fallacious arguments \nfrom the truth if we did not question. It is therefore right to ap-\nply the laws of reason. \nDoubt decides a hypothesis.

For far too long science has \nbeen locked into the destructive element of doubt in dismiss-\ning religion offhand as superstitious dogma. If it were the aim \nof the consortium of construction workers only to demolish all \ndefective buildings rather than reconstructing them, or with-\nout replacing them with improved structures, that would be \ndisastrous. It is the same with those who would do away with \nmorality and religion, leaving behind no structure for the hous-\ning of divine principles that can be proven essential to the \nwelfare and happiness of human existence.

That is how the God-\nknowing rishis of old attained their realization: they investi-\ngated, found, and proved for themselves those invariable princi-\nples that demonstrate and make manifest the Eternal Reality. \nThe great masters ask us to believe, but they do not say we \nshould not use constructive doubt to question.

Thus does the teacher who has attained realization \nsay to the undeveloped disciple, \"Until you are able to under-\nstand, believe and follow me.\" That does not mean blind accep-\ntance. Constructive belief has reason within it. Reason and \nfeeling confirm that there is some truth behind every valid be-\nlief. If one can gain access to his inherent discriminative intelli-\ngence, he can arrive at that truth—the inner comprehension of \ntruth that is attainable only by the spiritual development of the \nsoul's intuitive powers of perception. Until then, there might \nbe contradiction between the devotee's reason and the master's \nrealization. So true masters must ask their disciples to believe, \nto take for granted certain concepts on their authority, knowing \nthat in time they can realize those truths for themselves.

Belief and faith differ \nchiefly in that belief as a rule suggests little more than intel-\nlectual assent, while faith implies total trust or confidence— \nas in one whose persuasion or belief has ripened into faith. \nA persuasion is an assured opinion, an idea of which one \nhas convinced himself, as \"It is my persuasion that he is a dis-\nhonest person.\" It implies that this assurance is induced by \none's feelings or wishes, rather than by argument or evidence. \nConviction stands for a fixed and settled belief, as \"His \npersuasion has been forged into a feeling of certainty.\" \nCredence gives substance to belief; something must be \nconsidered believable to be held as true. \nBelief depends also on reliance, which is confidence in \nthe thing believed arising from supportive evidence. \nImplicit in belief are the elements of will and imagina-\ntion. Without willingness one cannot believe. And since belief \nis an uncertain waiting in the hope of obtaining a result, it in-\nvolves also imagination.

Hence, in material things wrong beliefs are liable to be less \nwasteful, since our minds are bent toward tangible results. \nIn contrast, concerning spiritual matters, our mental attitude \noften remains vague and visionary.

Or practical faith— \nthrough the acceptance by the intellect, affection, and \nwill—in God's favor extended to man through His di-\nvine emissaries. \n• The aggregate of that which is believed: a system of re-\nligious beliefs, as the Christian faith or Vedic authority. \nThe result of faith is the stable quality or state of faith-\nfulness, fidelity, loyalty. \nHave Intrepid Faith Despite Life's Enigmas \nLife, its substance and purpose, is an enigma, difficult yet \nnot unknowable.

Our enthusiastic minds are rudely seized by a \nsense of helplessness when we are victimized by floods, torna-\ndoes, or earthquakes,- or when, apparently without rhyme or \nreason, illness or accident snatches our dear ones from our bos-\nom. It is then that we know we really haven't conquered much. \nIn spite of all our efforts to make life what we want it to be, \nthere will always remain certain conditions introduced on this \nplanet—infinite and guided by an unknown Intelligence, oper-\nating without our initiative—which preclude our control.

The more this \nnewfound faith will work its dynamic influence on you, the \nmore your slavery to weakness will wane proportionately. \nNot a corpuscle of blood can move, nor a puff of breath en-\nter your nostrils, without the commandment of the Lord. \nHence, absolute surrender to God is the criterion of faith. This \nsurrender is not laziness, expecting God to do everything for \nyou—your utmost effort to bring about the desired result is also \nnecessary—rather, it is a surrender through love for God and \nveneration of His supremacy. No matter what the obstacles, I \nwould work to the last breath in me in complete surrender to \nGod, but I would never surrender through cowardice or fear of \nfailure. \nFaith Is Ever Secure—Direct Perception of Truth \nFaith not only produces results in healing or in other suc-\ncesses, it is also the power that reveals the outworking of spir-\nitual laws that underlie all so-called miracles. \n\"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence \nof things not seen.\"* Hoped-for \"impossibilities\" will be real-\nized through the power of this faith—which believes without \nseeing, which believes even in the face of all odds. \nFaith is realization itself. It harbors no destructive element, \nas does belief. Belief can be swayed or destroyed by contrary \nevidence and doubt; but faith is ever secure, because it is direct \nperception of truth. Once the world was believed to be flat, but \nwith the progress of science it was found to be round; so that \nwas only a belief, which had to be given up. But faith cannot \nbe contradicted, for it is the developed expression of the un-\nerring intuition within us, which brings us face to face with \ntheretofore unseen realities. One may thus rightly refer to \nblind belief, but not blind faith. \nThe soul's realization of truth expresses itself to us through \nintuition, and the resultant knowing is faith. Intuition is that \npoint wherein a conviction suddenly changes into the direct \nperception of the truth of that belief. It requires no intermedi-\nary, no proof from the testimony of the senses or reason. \n*Hebrews \n11:1 (Bible). \n"}

Even if you were paralyzed \nand could not see yourself, still you would feel or \nexperience \nyour existence through the perception of the soul. \nFaith is the A,B,C,D of intuition. It is a deep feeling of \nknowing within you. Most everyone has experienced a hunch \nthat has come true. That is a manifestation of developing or un-\ncontrolled intuition.

San-\nskrit svas refers to the motions of breath, implying thereby life \nand feeling.

The cultivation of intuitive calmness re-\nquires unfoldment of the inner life. When developed sufficiently, \nintuition brings immediate comprehension of truth. You can \nhave this marvelous realization. Meditation is the way. \nMeditate with patience and persistence. In the gathering \ncalmness, you will enter the realm of soul intuition. Through-\nout the ages, those beings who attained enlightenment were \nthose who had recourse to this inner world of God-communion. \nJesus said: \"When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and \nwhen thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in \nsecret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee \nopenly.\"* Go within the Self, closing the door of the senses \nand their involvement with the restless world, and God will \nreveal to you all His wonders. \nIn the inner communion of the soul with God, intuition be-\ngins to unfold naturally. Initially, a sort of provisional trust is \n* Matthew 6:6 (Bible). \n"}

Each word represents an ideal con-\nception of the Infinite, because behind each word and thought \nis a manifestation of Spirit. Many waves of thought are danc-\ning in the waves of consciousness; but behind that, there is \nthe great unceasing Ocean of Truth. Our thought expressions \nare waves of this ocean of understanding. \nWhat is the meaning of resurrection? To live again! To rise \nto renewed life! What rises again—and how? We must under-\nstand in what way resurrection means to live again. Every-\nthing is undergoing a process of change. These changes are ei-\nther detrimental or beneficial to the object that changes. For \nexample, if I take a dirty glass and strike it on the floor, it will \nbe changed, will it not? But this change will not be beneficial; \nit will be harmful to the object. However, if I wash the glass and \nmake it shine, that change is beneficial. Resurrection \nmeans \nany beneficial change to an object or to a human being. \nYou can resurrect your old furniture in the carpenter's or up-\nholsterer's shop. You can resurrect your house through the help \nof architects. But we are talking of resurrecting the human \nbody. In this context, resurrection means any uplifting change. \nYou cannot remain at a standstill. You must either go forward \nor backward. That is a great and inspiring truth, that in life you \ncannot remain stationary. Either you must accept changes that \nare harmful to you or those that are beneficial to you. \n* Under the direction of Paramahansa Yogananda, portions of this talk, as \nwell as of other early talks and articles, were incorporated into the compila \ntion of the Yogoda Satsanga Society Lessons. \n330 \n"}

Mental development is a \nproduct of physical development, or evolution. We find, ac-\ncording to natural evolution, that the soul resurrects itself to \nthe plane of intellect or the plane of prosperity—manifesting \nthe unique endowments of human beings—and then rises to \nthe plane of spiritual realization, which gives a meaning to all \nprosperous development and intellectual attainment. Intellec-\ntual attainments are undoubtedly helpful—all good things \nhelp. Gradually, we understand the way to resurrect the body \ninto the Spirit, by spiritualizing the body and mind to become \nfit instruments for the expression of Spirit. \nResurrection means to free the soul from the cage of ig-\nnorance; to uplift and release the soul from the bondage of mor-\ntal consciousness. Human life is sometimes very beautiful, but \none who is attached to it is like a bird of paradise in a cage. You \nopen the bird's cage, but because of attachment and habit, it \nmay not want to fly away. Isn't it a pity that the bird does not \nwant to go out into the boundless freedom whence it came? Yet \nit is afraid. We also, feeling ourselves slipping out of body con-\nsciousness in deep meditation, may think: \"Will I slide into the \nInfinite and never come back?\" We are afraid to try the skies \nof limitless consciousness. We have lived too long identified \nwith the body; and now we shrink from entering our infinite \nomnipresence, frightened to resurrect the omnipotence and \nomniscience of our soul. To resurrect our innate wisdom from \nthe bondage of the body is spiritual resurrection. \nBodily Freedom Is Not Real Freedom \nI will talk of body resurrection now, of promoting those up-\nlifting changes in the body that are beneficial to you. What I \nhave to say first is about living-dead people walking on the streets. \n"}

I \nshall broadcast this information. Nature will not listen to ex-\ncuses of your years of transgression against her health rules. If \nyou eat sensibly, then if you are in the habit of breaking some \nlaws occasionally, it will not so much hurt you. \nI have never felt better in my life. Though sometimes I \nwas sickly in my youth, I have very strong muscles now. Of \ncourse Yogoda [Self-Realization Fellowship techniques], and \nnot only food, helps that. \nRight Food Must Be Taken \nI recently met a man called Uncle Billy Ries—seventy-\nnine years old. He has grown a full shock of hair on a per-\nfectly bald head. He said that he had been for years carrying a \nbay window in front, and was given up to die at twenty-five \nyears of age. He resurrected himself. He began by thinking, \"If \nthere is a God, He has no business in making me sick\"; then \nhe began to think it must be his own fault. You see, he was res-\nurrecting himself from the disease that he had been con-\nstantly attracting to himself through his own fault. He found \nthat sixteen elements are necessary to the body. So he altered \nhis diet accordingly and got back his health completely. He \nkicks way up high in the air, and he successfully pitted his \nstrength against mine. We are great friends. Much valuable \nhealth information I owe to him. \nSince you have to eat, why not eat rightly? You can have a \nwhole meal often, yet be on a starvation diet; whole meals of \nwhite bread and sugar and pies might satisfy one's hunger, but \nwould kill in a few months. So resurrect yourself from the bad \nhabit of eating wrongly. A rattlesnake gives you warning be-\nfore it strikes, but rich gravy and white flour won't tell you; \nthey look and taste so very nice. Everything white—refined \nflour, sugar, and grains—is not always good; sometimes brown \na large percentage of raw fruits and vegetables, he advised: \"If your diet has \nconsisted chiefly of cooked foods, introduce raw foods into it gradually, until \nyour system becomes accustomed to the change. When cooking vegetables, it \nis better to steam than boil them. Vegetables cooked in water should be eaten \nwith the broth in which they were prepared.\" \n"}

According to experiments by German scientists, \nmany people are better off because they do not constantly ana-\nlyze their physical condition or suffer from mental discourage-\nment because of their maladies.

You must give the \nwhole credit to God, remembering that you are living directly \nby His power. Resurrect yourself from the consciousness of \nphysical disease. God did not create disease.

But open the bottle, and the water inside \nmerges with the sea. We must remove the cork of ignorance \nbefore we can come in contact with Spirit. \nInfinity is our Home. We are just sojourning awhile in the \ncaravanserai of the body. Those who are drunk with delusion \nhave forgotten how to follow the trail that leads to God. But \nwhen in meditation the Divine gets hold of the prodigal child, \nthere is no dallying anymore. \nEnter the portals of the New Year with new hope. Re-\nmember you are a child of God. It lies with you as to what you \nare going to be. Be proud that you are a child of God. What \nhave you to fear? No matter what comes, believe it is the Lord \nwho is sending that to you,- and you must succeed in conquer-\ning those daily challenges. Therein lies your victory. Do His \nwill; nothing can hurt you then. He loves you everlastingly. \nThink that. Believe that. Know that. And suddenly one day \nyou will find you are immortally alive in God. \nMeditate more and believe in that strong consciousness \nthat God is always with you regardless of what happens. Then \nyou will see that the veil of delusion will be taken away and \nyou will be one with That which is God. That is how I found \nmy greatest happiness in life. I am not looking for anything \nnow because I have everything in Him. Never would I part \nwith That which is the richest of all possessions. \nThis is my message to you for the New Year. \n"}

Every-\none sees and judges you according to his own mind. Years ago \nthere was a young boy who traveled with us on a lecture tour \nfrom the East Coast to Los Angeles. He went out of his way to \ncriticize everything. Before lecture time I used to comb my long \nhair. He was always analyzing me, but he didn't know that I had \nmy mental camera on him also. After two weeks I said to him, \n\"I would like to have a chat with you.

Since I knew you were doing so, I wanted to give you \nsomething to write about, so I have taken special pains to \nstand before the mirror and exaggerate the combing of my hair.\" \nHe was ashamed. \nWhat you are before God and your own conscience, that is \nwhat you are. Even if the whole world misunderstands you, \nnothing is lost; you are what you are. To stand criticism is a very \neffective way of becoming a better individual. Though it is eas-\nier to criticize others than to find fault in yourself, it is of prime \nimportance to correct yourself first. I learned from Master to \npick myself to pieces when criticized.

Each one of you who loves \nGod is my own. The nature-ordained compulsion of the famil-\nial relationship is misleading; but the spiritual relationship is \nlasting, because God is our Father and we are His children. A \nmother loves her child now; but if that child dies and is reborn \nnext door to her, she won't recognize that child in the same \nway. But the spiritual relationship is the strongest bond be-\ncause it is continuous from one lifetime to another. \nIn the ultimate sense, as we are all the children of God we \nmust learn to love everyone wholeheartedly and completely and \nimpartially.

The love of the mother is close to \nthe perfection of God's love, because she loves us when no-\nbody else does; and she forgives when we are in error. But the \nultimate expression of God's love is the love of a true guru. He \nloves us unconditionally,- and out of that sublime love he in-\nstructs and disciplines us for the everlasting welfare of our \nsouls. Though I shall always dearly love my mother, my love \nfor my Master is supreme. \nReal Love Versus Selfish Love \nDo everything with the attitude of love—love for God and \nfor God in all. It is hard for the ordinary person to tell the dif-\nference between a desire for others' good and a desire to sat-\nisfy self-love. Often one who is well-intentioned in caring for \nothers is carried away instead by self-love. When the desire for \nself-interest is gone completely from the consciousness, and \nthe only desire is to serve others and do the highest good for \nall, that is wisdom. It is very difficult to do; but when selfish \nlove completely goes, then one tastes divine love. \nReal love is when you are constantly watching the prog-\nress of the soul. As soon as you cater to someone's physical de-\nsires and bad habits you are not loving that soul anymore. You \nare just pleasing that person to avoid ill will. No matter how \nunpleasant it is to tell a friend that he is wrong, if you say it \nwith love in your heart and stand firm on it, sometime that \nperson will respect you if you are right. If you are wrong, even \nthen he will know that you did it with sincerity, out of love. \nNever agree with anyone who is wrong, not even those who \nare nearest and dearest to you. To agree with wrongdoing is to \nbribe your soul in order to be looked upon favorably by the \nwrongdoer, and that will come out later on in some disastrous \nresults. Do not fight; that is not the way to convince them. \nThe way to influence others is by your love. Say what you \nhave to say once or twice and then disband it from your mind. \nBe humble and free from anger.

If you have that \ndivine attitude, you will be conquerors of hearts. There is noth-\ning more satisfying than that. You will never be alone, for you \nwill attract to yourself real souls. Even if you are left alone, you \nare with God. \nYou do not know how wonderful is that kind of love. It is \nsublime.

Love outlasts death and the rav-\nages of time. All those that I have loved before, in this or \nother lifetimes, I love the same now. \nAttachment is disastrous, because it is that which is com-\npulsive and limiting. As soon as a child is born the mother \nfalls in love with it. That feeling is impressed on the mother \nby nature, otherwise she would not take care of the helpless \ninfant. The compulsion to love our family members was given \nto us as our first lesson in learning to give love to all, uncondi-\ntionally. But attachment spoils family love, and all forms of \nhuman relationships, because it excludes others and is blindly \npossessive. Disband attachment and learn to give true, sincere \nlove to all. True love is impersonal and is not bound by any-\nthing. Our eyes bubble over with love, and we feel a wonderful \ntogetherness,- we feel we are one. Once in a while that is felt in \nordinary life, but then it is so easily mutilated by familiarity and \nlack of respect. \nWe must learn to love our family purely, to love our friends \npurely, to love our country purely, and to love all mankind \n"}

You are in my heart.\" \nAnd when great love for God comes in your heart, you do not \nmiss anything; no matter what you have or do not have in this \nworld, you nevertheless feel fulfilled. Divine love transmutes all \nmaterial desires—even the longing for human love, that mortal \npassion which so often brings pain either from its fickle nature \nor because it is snatched away by death. Loving the Lord, you \ncan never turn back to being satisfied by lesser loves. In Him \nyou will find all the love of all hearts.

Born in Gorakhpur, India, in 1893, Parama-\nhansa Yogananda was sent by his guru to the United States in 1920 \nas India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Lib-\nerals. Subsequent lectures in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia \nwere enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a \ncross-continental speaking tour. \nFor the next decade Paramahansaji traveled extensively, giv-\ning lectures and classes in which he instructed thousands of men \nand women in the yoga science of meditation and balanced spiri-\ntual living. \nThe work he began, with the founding of Yogoda Satsanga \nSociety of India in 1917 and the establishment of the international \nheadquarters of Self-Realization Fellowship in Los Angeles in \n1925, continues under the guidance of Sri Sri Daya Mata.

See page 419), his society oversees ashrams, \nkendras, and meditation centers around the world; monastic train-\ning programs,- and the Worldwide Prayer Circle, which serves as a \nchannel to help bring healing to those in need and greater peace \nand harmony among all nations. Seekers in India and surround-\ning territories are served by Yogoda Satsanga Society of India. \nThe life and teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda are de-\nscribed in his Autobiography \nof a Yogi, which has become a \nclassic in its field since its publication in 1946, and is now used \nas a text and reference work in many colleges and universities \nthroughout the world. \n417 \n"}

Thus he conceived \"a series of \nweekly studies for the yoga seekers all over the world\"—to per-\npetuate in their original purity, and in written form, the teach-\nings handed down to him by his lineage of gurus. \nThe Yogoda Satsanga Society Lessons present the methods \nof concentration, energization, and meditation taught by Parama-\nhansa Yogananda that are an integral part of the Kriya Yoga sci-\nence.

In \nhis evolution, man passes through four distinct grades, desig-\nnated by ancient Hindu sages as Sudra, \nVaisya, \nKshatriya, \nand \nBrahmin. \nThe Sudra \nis interested primarily in satisfying his \nbodily needs and desires; the work that best suits his state of \ndevelopment is bodily labor. The Vaisya \nis ambitious for \nworldly gain as well as for satisfaction of the senses; he has \nmore creative ability than the Sudra \nand seeks occupation as a \nfarmer, a businessman, an artist, or wherever his mental energy \nfinds fulfillment. The Kshatriya, \nhaving through many lives \nfulfilled the desires of the Sudra \nand Vaisya \nstates, begins to \nseek the meaning of life,- he tries to overcome his bad habits, \nto control his senses, and to do what is right. Kshatriyas \nby \noccupation are noble rulers, statesmen, warriors. The \nBrah-\nmin has overcome his lower nature, has a natural affinity for \nspiritual pursuits, and is God-knowing, able therefore to teach \nand help liberate others. \ncausal body. Essentially, man as a soul is a causal-bodied being. \nHis causal body is an idea-matrix for the astral and physical \nbodies.
