From the earliest years of his life, he longed to know \nGod, to taste the thirst-quenching waters of Spirit.\nHis  search  for  the Infinite  led  him to  Sri Yukteswar,  his Preceptor. Under the \nguidance of this God-realized teacher, he attained Supreme Realization and was given the \nrevered title of Paramhansa* by his Preceptor in 1935. Paramhansa Yogananda+ later \nbrought the special Techniques of Concentration and Meditation to the Western World, \nincluding Kriya Yoga which is the scientific method to accelerate the devotee’s spiritual \nunfoldment.\nIn addition to bringing the Techniques of Concentration and Meditation to the West, \nParamhansaji’s  great  spiritual  mission  included  imparting  his  intuitively-perceived \ninterpretations of the Christian Bible. Throughout the text of The Interpretations of  The \nSermon on the Mount, Paramhansa Yogananda uses capitalization to place emphasis on a \nspecific truth to aid the reader. In the instances where there is redundancy of material, he \nincludes it because it relates and clarifies the new material introduced.\n* Paramhansa – literally, param, highest; hansa, swan. The hansa is represented in scriptural lore as the \nvehicle of Brahma, Supreme Spirit; as the symbol of discrimination, the white hansa swan is thought of as \nable to separate the true soma nectar from a mixture of milk and water.\n+ Yogananda means “Bliss (ananda) through divine union (yoga)”.\n4\n"}

The Spiritual interpretation of the Christian Bible reveals and liberates the \nTruth hidden in the dark caves of theoretical and theological studies.\nJesus Christ was crucified once, but His Christian teaching has been, and is now \nbeing crucified by ignorant people. The understanding and application of these intuitively-\nperceived teachings are attempting to show how the Christ Consciousness of Jesus, free \nfrom theological crucifixion, can be brought back a second time into the souls of men.\nThese  spiritual  interpretations  are  born  of  intuition,  and  will  be  found  to  be \nuniversally true if they are meditated upon with intuitive perception.\n5\n"}

This is what is meant by “received Him”. \nThus, according to Jesus, all souls who can actually find their souls one with Christ \nConsciousness, by intuitive Self-Realization, can be called the “Sons of God”.\nAll Scriptures, such as the Bhagavad Gita, or the Hindu Bible, and the Christian \nBible, have a three-fold meaning. In other words, the Scriptures deal with three factors of \nhuman  beings,  namely,  the  material,  the  mental,  and  the  spiritual.  Hence,  all  true \nScriptures have been so written that they serve to be beneficial to the body, mind, and soul \nof man. True Scriptures are like the wells of Divine waters, which can quench the three-fold \nmaterial, mental, and spiritual thirsts of man. In addition, the Scriptures, in order to be \nworth-while, should really help the businessman, the mental man, and the spiritual man. \nAlthough both the material and the psychological interpretations of the Scriptures are \nnecessary, it should be remembered that the scriptural authors undertook with great pains \nto point out to man that the spiritual interpretations are of supreme importance to him.\nA  materially  or  intellectually  successful  man  may  not  be  truly,  scientifically \nsuccessful man who makes a perfect success of life; whereas, a spiritual man is the happy \n“all-round” man, who is healthy, intellectual, contented, and truly prosperous, with all-\nsatisfying wisdom. Since by intuition the spiritual authors first sought to make man primarily \nspiritual, I give the spiritual interpretation with the psychological and material interpretations \ninterwoven. These interpretations will help alike the spiritual aspirant, the intellectual man, \nand the businessman.\nThese intuitively-perceived spiritual interpretations of the words spoken by Jesus \nChrist are to be studied every day conscientiously and meditated upon by true Christian \nand all true devotees of God.\nUniversal Christ Consciousness appeared in the vehicle of Jesus, and now through \nthe specific techniques of concentration and meditation as taught in the original Praecepta \nLessons,  and  these  intuitionally-received  interpretations  of  the  Scriptures,  the  Christ \nConsciousness is coming a second time to manifest through the consciousness of every \ntrue devotee of God.\n*Initially the organizational name and the written teachings in America of Paramhansa Yogananda were \nknown  as  Yogoda  Sat-Sanga  Society  and  Yogoda  Course,  respectively.  He  later enlarged  his  written \nteachings and changed the name of them to the Praecepta. The Techniques of Concentration and Meditation \nand Kriya Yoga as taught in the original Praecepta Lessons are available from Amrita Foundation, Inc.\n7\n"}

On one such occasion, in later years, he asked a question of Jesus \npertaining to these writings.\nIt was a time of silent prayer and his room became filled with an opal-blue light, and \nChrist  appeared  –  radiant  and  about  him  a  glow  of  golden  light.  Looking  into  his \nwondrously beautiful eyes, he asked Christ if he had pleased him in the way he had \ninterpreted his teachings.\nAt once a Chalice appeared at Christ’s lips, and then came over to touch his own, \nand Christ answered:\n“Your lips have quaffed the same LIVING WATERS from which I drink.”\nWords of matchless assurance! This holy response was sacredly cherished within \nhis heart.\n8\n"}

Jesus preferred one \nseeking soul to a crowd of merely curious persons, and so He was seeking crowds of \nSouls and not noisy crowds without Souls.\nThose people who can manage to meditate on a mountain top find it very quiet, and \nfree from noise and the obnoxious vapors of the city. A high elevation brings the meditator \nto a rarefied atmosphere which is free from gross gases. On a mountain top the physical \nand Astral bodies of man become adjusted and dependent upon a finer atmosphere than \nthe gross atmosphere of the valley. \n“He opened His mouth and taught them” means that during His teaching, Jesus let \nloose some of His Life Force and vibration over the disciples, so that they became calm \nand magnetized to receive His vibration perfectly. \n“Blessed are the poor in spirit: for their's is the kingdom of heaven.” \n(Matthew 5:3)\nThe word “Blessed” comes from Bliss, which is ever-new, everlasting joy, never \ngrowing stale like short-lasting human happiness. Here the word “poor” signifies wanting in \nelegance, or marks of Spiritual wealth. Those who have vast spirituality never make a \ndisplay of it. Those who appear to be poverty-stricken in spirit or those who shed all desire \nfor material objects, earthly possessions, mundane friends, and human love will be rich \nwith the everlasting Kingdom of Wisdom and Bliss where God and the Saints dwell in \nconstant communion with them. People who are materially rich may have no inner Spiritual \ndevelopment, and those who are materially poor by choice may be spiritually rich. To be \npoor in spirit does not mean that you have to be a pauper, but it certainly means that you \nmust not think of material acquisitions as a state of Spiritual opulence.\nWhen the spirit of man mentally renounces (that is, becomes poor) all desires for \nobjects of this world, knowing them to be illusory, perishable, misleading, and unbecoming \nto the soul, then man begins to find bliss in acquiring lasting inner qualities. The materially \npoor  soul, after  obtaining  many  lasting  soul  qualities  of  ever-new  bliss and  wisdom, \nultimately inherits the lost Kingdom of Immortality and Heavenly Bliss. \n“Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.”\n(Matthew 5:4)\n9\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - The Sermon on the Mount interpretted by (47p).pdf", "page": 10, "text": "Ordinary suffering from loss of material possessions and from unfulfilled earthly \nhopes leads to sorrow, which is very detrimental to the retention of Spiritual Bliss obtained \nby strenuous efforts.\nMaterial sorrow eclipses and buries mental, physical, and Spiritual happiness, but \nmourning  or  deep  sorrow due  to  separation  from Truth, or God,  creates in one  the \ninsatiable desire to make the greatest effort to contact God directly. Those who really \nmourn and wail for God and Truth incessantly, with ever-increasing zeal, shall find comfort \ndue to the revealing of Wisdom-Bliss sent to them by God. It is the naughty baby who cries \ncontinuously for Spiritual knowledge who attracts the attention of the Divine Mother and \nwho is comforted by Her Wisdom revealed through intuition or by the revelation of Her own \nPresence. \nThose who long for material things, and get them, will have to mourn again when all \nof them are taken away at the time of death. But those who long for Truth and God will be \nforever comforted after receiving the ever-joyous Divinity.  \n“Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” \n(Matthew 5:5)\nBlessed are the ones who are meek and humble in spirit, for humbleness and \nmeekness create in them a bottomless receptacle of recipiency to hold all Truth. A stone-\nhard, proud individual rolls down the hill of ignorance and gathers no moss of wisdom, \nwhile the meek souls in the valley of eager mental readiness gather the waters of wisdom \ncoming from  all human and  Divine  sources. The  proud man prevents  all Truth  from \nentering through the castle of his soul. Those who gather wisdom in the valley of their \nsouls inherit the earth, that is, wisdom and earthly happiness, along with it.\n“Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be \nfilled.” \n(Matthew 5:6)\nThose people receive the ever-new Bliss of God who feel a great thirst and hunger \nfor doing only the supreme duties of life. Righteousness means to possess the quality of \ndoing only the right thing in all physical, mental, and Spiritual departments of life. Thirst is \nsatisfied with liquids and hunger is satisfied by solid food. These two words, “thirst and \nhunger,” are applied here in connection with Spiritual matters. A soul must first have thirst \nfor the theoretical knowledge of the technique of salvation. After that, when his thirst for the \ntechnique of salvation is satisfied, he begins to satisfy his constant hunger for Truth by \nswallowing the Divine manna, or daily Spiritual perception resulting from meditation. Those \nwho are thirsty and hungry for material things find that their thirst of desires is never \nquenched, nor is their hunger for material possessions ever satisfied. \nThe soul's desire or thirst and hunger for God can only be alleviated by attaining \nimmortality and the imperishable state of Divinity. But when the soul foolishly tries to \nquench its thirst with the substitutes of sense-happiness, it hops from one sense-pleasure \nto another, ultimately rejecting them all as inadequate for quenching its soul-thirst. Sense-\n10\n"}

Only the attainment of the right things for the \nsoul, such as immortality, virtue, bliss, right behavior, and so on, can fill or satisfy the soul. \n“Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.”\n(Matthew 5:7)\nMercy is a sort of fatherly heartache for the deficiency in child souls. The wise alone \ncan  be  really  merciful,  for  they  look  upon  all  wrong-doers  as  children  who  deserve \nsympathy, forgiveness, help, and guidance. Mercy is useless unless the fatherly heartache \nmelts and expresses itself in offering forgiveness and actual spiritual help in eliminating the \nerror in an individual. The morally weak but willing-to-be good, the real sinner, (the greatest \ntransgressor against his own happiness) and the spiritually ignorant, should obtain merciful \nhelp from the wise. Besides these, the physically decrepit and the mentally and spiritually \nweak all need merciful help from souls that are capable of rendering merciful help. \nMercy denotes the capacity for being helpful. Therefore, only developed or qualified \nsouls can be practically and mercifully useful. Souls who continuously develop themselves \nin every way and mercifully feel the lack of all-round development in others, surely will melt \nthe heart of God with compassionate sympathy and obtain His unending and helpful \nmercy. In other words, you must be merciful to yourself by making yourself spiritually \nqualified, and must also be merciful to other deluded children of God if you want to receive \ndivine mercy. \n“Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.” \n(Matthew 5:8)\nPurity of the intellect gives one the power of correct reasoning, but purity of the heart \ngives one the contact of God. Of course, pure wisdom and divine understanding are \nidentical. Intellectuality is a quality of the power of reason, and wisdom is the redeeming \nquality of the soul. Intellectuality is confined to developing the power of human reason, \nwhich can interpret the data offered by the senses. Wisdom signifies the all-seeing power \nof the soul, which not only truly interprets phenomena as presented by the senses, but \ninterprets the pneumena, the substance or cause, which lies screened behind the vision of \nthe senses. \nPurity signifies wisdom-guided actions or the adjusting of human actions to the \nsacred soul qualities of love, mercy, service, self-control, self-discipline, conscience, and \nintuition. \nThe pure-eyed quality of wisdom must be combined with the feeling of the heart. \nWisdom shows the righteous path and the heart desires and loves to follow that path. That \nis,  all  wisdom-guided  pure  qualities  must  be  whole-heartedly  (not  intellectually  or \ntheoretically) followed.\nAfter attaining purity and wisdom, one can perceive God who is a combination of \nsupreme wisdom and supreme love. When pure wisdom is combined with pure divine love \nfor all Beings, then one can see or become One with God. Physically we see through our \neyes, but spiritual seeing is performed by the all-seeing, all-feeling eyes of intuition. When \n11\n"}

This \ndeveloped intuition reveals to the true devotee the true God as the union of wisdom and \ndivine love. \n“Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.”\n(Matthew 5:9)\nThose who make peace in the factory of meditation are the children of God. He is \nthe first-born-peace in the Temple of Silence. God is the first peace felt in meditation. God \nfirst  manifests  Himself  as  peace  to  one  who  meditates.  Hence,  those  who  regularly \nmeditate are the makers or worshippers of Peace-God, and therefore, they are His true \nchildren. Those who worship God as the peace of meditation are the ones who truly know \nand feel the nature of God. \nSuch devotees, who feel God as peace, always want the Peace-God to be manifest \nin their home, in society, in the neighborhood, in the nation, and in all nationalities and \nraces. So, anyone who brings peace to an inharmonious family has established God there. \nAnyone who removes the misunderstanding between souls has united them in God's \npeace. Anyone who, forsaking national greed and selfishness, works to establish peace \namidst warring nations, is establishing God in the heart of nations. Anyone who stirs up \nstrife among brother nations under the guise of patriotism is a traitor – a faithless child of \nGod. Anyone who keeps family members, neighbors, and friends fighting through fostering \nfalsehoods and gossip, is also a maker of disturbance and helps to oust God from the \ntemple of harmony. \n“Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for their's is the \nkingdom of heaven.”\n(Matthew 5:10)\nThe bliss of God will visit those souls who let themselves undergo the torture of the \nfalse criticism of so-called friends for doing what is right, uninfluenced by wrong customs or \nsocial habits. Do not drink because you happened to be at a cocktail party. If people call \nyou crazy for acting right in not drinking, rejoice, for through self-control you will attain bliss \nand perfection. \nHolding on to your spiritual beliefs, even if you have to lose your body, as did the \nmartyrs of yore, is admirable, for you will inherit the immortal blissful Kingdom of God. A \nsoul who relinquishes all material desires and cheerfully stands the ridicule of short-sighted \nfriends, demonstrates that he is fit for the unending bliss of God. Worldly people prefer \nsense-pleasure  to  the  unending  bliss  of  God,  and  that  is  why  they  are  foolish  or \nunrighteous. They do not know what is righteous or good for them. The true devotee is \nrighteous, for he knows that to contact God's unending bliss is right and good for himself in \nthe highest sense. \nThe above passage also means that those souls who are persecuted and tortured \nby the temptations of the senses and by bad habits in order to cling to the peace and \npower  in self-control and  to the happiness of meditation, are  righteous, for they are \n12\n"}

Those \nwho resist temptation, but are not convinced that temptation promises only a little pleasure, \nand always gives sorrow, and that temptation is not the thing to indulge in, turn into \nhypocrites and ultimately succumb to the wiles of temptation. When tempted, you must \nknow that temptation is poisoned honey and that God is the honey of immortality sealed in \nmystery. Those who meditate break the mystery seal and drink the honey of immortality. \nHeaven is that state of transcendental, omnipresent joy where no sorrows ever dare \nto tread. By following continuous good actions, souls ultimately reach that beatific state of \nbliss from which there is no fall. Only people who are not fixed in meditation slip and fall \nfrom this state of happiness. \nHeaven is termed a kingdom because each devotee, gaining that state of cosmic \nbliss, becomes one with the King of Heavenly Bliss, or God. That kingdom of Cosmic \nConsciousness is owned by the King, God, or by any elevated soul who becomes one with \nGod. The soul who merges himself with God feels the cosmic bliss of being one with God. \nHence, any devotee who aspires to own the Kingdom of Heaven, must unite his ego with \nGod and become the King of the Universe. \n“Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all  \nmanner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad: for great is \nyour reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.”\n(Matthew 5:11-12)\nThe above does not mean that one has to create a band of revilers or persecutors in \norder to reach the Kingdom of Heaven. It signifies that, if it so happens that, in the course \nof your spiritual living, you find that materially-minded people persecute you for your virtue, \nand you can pass through that test cheerfully without yielding to their wrong ways, then you \nwill find the bliss coming from God and the happiness that results from clinging to the true \nbliss-yielding habits. If people criticize you for your wrong actions, even though you are \noutwardly good, do not flatter yourself that your are being persecuted for God's sake. It is \nonly when people call you evil, when you know that you are good, and when they say that \nyou are wrong when you know that you are right, that you must not be sorrowful, but \nrejoice. You must retain the joy of meditation if you are right, in spite of praise or blame \nfrom people. \nIf you want to stop going to the movies too many times, or to forego idle talk with \nyour relatives and neighbors, in order to preserve and maintain the acquired peace of \nmeditation and thus be subject to their criticism for not wasting your time as they do, then \nrejoice, for you will, through adherence to divine habits of bliss, ultimately inherit the \nkingdom of unending bliss. \n“To be persecuted for my name's sake” signifies being criticized for maintaining the \nfeeling of bliss resulting from meditation. God is bliss and His first manifestation to the \ndevotee is bliss in the temple of meditation. \n13\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - The Sermon on the Mount interpretted by (47p).pdf", "page": 14, "text": "Being rewarded in Heaven signifies the state of eternal bliss felt in stabilizing the \nstate of peace resulting from meditation. The man who gives up meditating because of the \ncriticism of his neighbors, relatives, or so-called friends, loses the contact of heavenly bliss. \nThose who can retain their state of bliss, acquired by meditation, are doubly rewarded, due \nto the stability of bliss increasing to greater bliss. This is the psychological reward resulting \nfrom the stabilization of the habit of enjoying the bliss of meditation. If anyone can become \nfixed in bliss, according to the law of habit, he will be rewarded with continuous bliss. \nHeaven is not only a state of bliss felt in this life; is it also an afterdeath state in \nwhich ever-new joy is felt in the immortalized soul. \nCompletely redeemed souls are those who do not have any mortal desires in their \nhearts when they leave the shores of the earth. These are the souls who, by overcoming \nmortal  desires,  become  permanently  fixes  as  pillars  in  the  mansion  of  Cosmic \nConsciousness, and never go out again or become reincarnated on the earth plane unless \nthey do so willingly in order to bring earth-bound souls back to the mansion of God. \n“Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go \nno more out.” (Rev. 3:12)\nBesides many others, Heaven is also the land of astral light, where atomic blossoms \nbloom in the garden of ether and where half-redeemed souls stay to enjoy the superior joys \nof astral life, and then, after the results of their good astral actions (karma) are worked out, \nthey are sent back to the earth through reincarnation. In the astral world, the climate, \natmosphere, food, and people are made of different vibrations of light and are extremely \nbeautiful and much more refined than the crudities of the earth. All furnishings, properties, \nclimatic conditions, and transportation, are brought about by the will power materializing or \ndematerializing electro-atomic Life Force. \nPartially righteous people, who fight temptation on earth, are allowed, after death, to \ngo to this semi-permanent abode of Astral Heaven, where many half-angels and half-\nredeemed souls carry on a superior, but similar, life to that on earth, dealing entirely with \nvibrations and energy, but with no solids, liquids, or gaseous substances, such as have to \nbe encountered during the earthly sojourn. \n“For great is your reward in Heaven,” signifies that if you perform good actions on \nearth, you will reap their fruits either on earth while living, or in Heaven after death. \nAccording to the testimony of Jesus, it is distinctly evident that life is continuous after \ndeath. In order to reap a reward for an earthly good action in Heaven, the good soul must \nsubsist after death. \nProphets are souls who are anchored in Truth, who try to lead people to spiritual \nways by their exemplary conduct. The prophetic state involves complete union with God. \nProphets come on earth to declare God in the mysterious spiritual way. They are usually \nextraordinary reformers who come on earth at the command of God to show extraordinary \nspiritual examples to mankind. They demonstrate the power and super influence of love \nover hate by getting themselves martyred. Prophets refuse to give out their Truths just \nbecause of persecution and they refuse to hate their persecutors. They demonstrate and \nretain the all-forgiving love of God even when severely tortured physically and mentally, \nthrough dishonor or false accusations. \n14\n"}

It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot \nof men. Ye are the light of the world.”\n(Matthew 5:13-14)\nThe above signifies that human souls are the most important of all earthly creatures, \nas sodium chlorides is the most important salt for quelling the thirst in desert travels. In the \nOrient, during desert travel, people carry large pieces of rock salt, which they lick during \nthe extreme heat of the desert in order to quench their thirst during the shortage of water. If \nanybody shares that life-giving salt with another, one speaks of him as having “eaten his \nsalt,” that is, shared his highest confidence. Besides, salt gives flavor to all food. For  most \nhuman beings, earthly life would be tasteless without it. Similarly, man himself is the “salt \nof the earth,” for among all creatures the human being has the highest capacity for doing \ngood to others. Therefore human beings are the salt of the earth. \nJesus says that if salt loses its savor it cannot be used in anything, nor can its \nquality be revived; therefore, it must be thrown away. So, people who are made in the \nimage of God, if they desecrate that image through ignorant living, lose their essential \nquality of being souls, and thus cease to be the salt of the earth, or cease to be the most \nserviceable Beings on earth. Unspiritual souls allow themselves to be down-trodden by the \nfeet of uselessness and death. \n“Ye are the light of the world,” signifies that human beings make this earth luminous \nby their presence. If the stars and the moon shone on this earth and the bleak mountains \nkept themselves decorated with silver peaks, but, if no man lived to appreciate them, they \nwould be in the perpetual darkness of oblivion. If blossoms waited and faded without the \ngaze of souls lured by their fragrance, ever entering their petal doors, who would know the \nbeauty of flowers? Not the hard-hearted mountains nor the brainless skies, but only souls \nwho, by the light of their consciousness, reveal the beauty of Nature and God.

Hence, man is the light of the world. No other living creature, except man, is \nendowed with the all-revealing lamp of human consciousness. \n“A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.

Evil eclipses the light of the soul. As the flame of a candle is extinguished \nby lack of oxygen, so a soul loses its luster without the vitality of goodness. Good souls \nmust not remain hidden, as expressed in Gray's “Elegy” -- “Full many a flower is born to \nblush unseen, and waste its sweetness on the desert air.” They ought to manifest their \ngood actions among men, so that dark souls may be illumined. Good souls shine with the \ninvisible Light of God. Good souls make the invisible Light of God's goodness visible in \ntheir hearts and actions, and good souls declare the presence of God and act like spiritual \nbeacons to lead stray souls back to the mansion of God. \nThe Father is hidden behind the etheric walls of heaven and cloistered in the \ninvisible castle of Cosmic Consciousness, and He comes out of His secret place only into \nthe temple of illumined souls. It is the light of goodness in advanced souls which reveals \nand declares the glory of the hidden Father. God is our Father because He is the Creator \nof all goodness, our Supreme sole originator and protector. \n“Think not that I come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, \nbut to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth shall pass, one jot or one tittle \nshall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” \n(Matthew 5:17-18)\nCommercial priest-craft often merchandises religion and distorts its principles. Great \nsaints are born to expose those distortions and to bring out the principles of truth which are \nuniversally true and useful for all times – present, past, and future.  But the commercial \npriests, afraid that their trade in religion will be hurt, always condemn the actions of true \nreformers as highly irreligious, unscriptural and blasphemous. \nForestalling this resistance and accusation from unscrupulous Pharisees, Jesus \nsounded a note of warning to His followers and emphatically said: “Remember ye, children, \nI came not to destroy the universal law of righteousness, nor the ever-true teachings of the \nprophets, but I came to revive them.”\nJesus came to show the difference between the true, eternal principles of religion \nand the distorted customs of religion. Religious customs are an alloy of partial religious \nprinciple and the weaknesses of human character. \nPriests, who cannot follow the strict religious principles, often modify them to suit \ntheir weaknesses and their accusing conscience. The principles of life and ideals should \nnever be dragged down to meet us even if we cannot reach their height. We should \nacknowledge our inability to follow the principles instead of lowering the sanctity of the \nideals that govern our lives. \nJesus said that matter and planetary manifestations, including the earth, were the \ncondensed mind and energy of God: “The word was made flesh and dwelt among us,” that \nis, the vibratory power of thought and energy were condensed into the earth shape. God's \nthought about creating  an  earth was  impregnated  with  His will  and  energy and  was \nquickened and materialized into the grosser vibration of earth or matter. \n16\n"}

For I say unto you, \nThat  except  your  righteousness  shall  exceed  the  righteousness  of  the  scribes  and \nPharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.”\n(Matthew 5:19-20)\nWhosoever does not live the life of truth in all its details, but who breaks one of the \nleast truths commanded from within by the voice of conscience and intuition, shall not be \nregarded  highly  according  to  the  standards  of  God-known  men.  The  greatest  in  the \nKingdom of God are those who are enjoying Cosmic Consciousness. Such souls obey the \ngreatest and the least laws which govern true life. \nThose who live according to the highest and the least laws of truth in their own lives, \nand  who  teach  them  both  vocally  and  specially  by  the  example  of  their  lives,  are \nconsidered high by those who are graced with Cosmic Consciousness. The Kingdom of \nHeaven  is  not  a  land  ruled  by  an  autocratic  divine  king.  It  is  a  state  of  Cosmic \nConsciousness, in which all dualities are abolished, and the consciousness of the One \nLoving King, Father, God, reigns on the throne of all space. \nThough there is no essential difference between souls who have completely attained \nthe state of Cosmic Consciousness, yet there are various grades of saints even among \nthose who have contacted God. The first contact of God may bring to a devotee great \nblessing and understanding, but that does not obliterate all of the effects of past actions. \nWith continuous experience of God's contact, incarnations of stored up effects of actions \nare gradually roasted out. The time necessary for the roasting process determined the \ndegree of greatness or the quality of saints. \nThose who have contacted God, and who yet break the least mandatory truths, and \nteach men the path of salvation, are called the least when viewed from the highest spiritual \nstandard. But those who practice all the compulsory spiritual laws relating to saintliness, \nand teach people to do the same by their living example, are called the greatest by those \nwho live in the one supreme spirit domain (kingdom) of Cosmic Consciousness.\nThose who do not completely practice spiritual doctrines in their lives and yet try to \nteach people the path of salvation, are not as good as those saints who teach people the \npath of God through spiritual living, in which all the minutest laws of Truth are practiced in \ndaily life. \nTo think truth may increase the desire to follow its laws. To think truth, but to neglect \nto follows its laws in life, may develop a double, hypocritical life. One must harness each \ngood  thought  to  the  corresponding  good  activity,  otherwise  too  much  thinking  about \ngoodness without a corresponding good activity, may make one develop wrong familiarity \nwith thinking true laws, leading to sheer neglect of bringing them into life. \n18\n"}

This kind of righteousness may \nmake one loyal to a theoretical philosophy or to a set of religious practices and beliefs, \nproducing an extremely diluted spiritual panacea without creating much soul-development. \nJesus spoke of developing the consciousness of doing right and living Truth, shorn \nof all superficial living. Real righteousness signifies complete identification with all Truth, or \ngood. \nIdentification with all Truth, and not its part, is only possible through meditation and \nSamadhi, or ecstasy, in which the devotee, the act of meditation, and God, as the object of \ncontemplation, all become one. \nMillions  of  people  do  not  even  think  about  religion,  and  millions  of  religious \nindividuals are satisfied with attending church one hour a week or by reading a few spiritual \nbooks, or practicing a few religious ceremonies. That is why they never attain Cosmic \nConsciousness or the Kingdom of God – the domain of all space, which is pervaded by our \nhumble Royal Spirit. This is the palpable reason why so few attain Christhood. \nDesire-mad human beings, like uncontrolled barges, are rushing down the flood \nstream of life, ready to fall from the rocks of experience down into the waters of death and \nbe drowned in oblivion. Only the wisdom-guided boats of lives stop rushing down the flood \nof custom and convention and touch the shores of all-redeeming contentment in God. \nThis is one of the greatest truths that Jesus told to all mankind: “If you want the \nkingdom of God, your meditation and righteousness must exceed the ordinary theoretical \nreligious living of priests. Unless you follow the real way, you can never attain the final \nstate of Cosmic Consciousness, of heavenly bliss, from which you can never fall again.”\n“Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill: and \nwhosoever shall kill, shall be in danger of judgment: But I say unto you, That whosoever is \nangry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever \nshall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, \nThou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.”\n(Matthew 5:21-22)\nJesus spoke here of the ancient law, “Thou shalt not kill, and whosoever shall kill \nshall be in danger of the judgment.” Those who destroy Heaven-created human beings by \nmisusing their reason and God-given independence will be judged by the inscrutable \nDivine Law. \nMurderers not only work against the law of Divine creation, but they deprive the \nmurdered individuals of the opportunity to work out their karma (past actions) and progress \ntoward God and spiritual emancipation. God creates mortal life; to kill is to obstruct the \nhighest Divine wish of bringing souls to immortality after purifying them in the furnace of \nmortal trials. \nThe thought and the desire to kill is also very dangerous, as the mental act of killing \nis the forerunner of the actual physical act of killing.

All thoughts, speech, and actions relative to murder must be strictly \navoided. \nJesus also said that it is not only wrong to kill, but it is evil to be angry without cause, \nfor anger may lead to murderous actions. Jesus said that you are to love your enemies, \nand  here  He  tells  you  not  to  be  angry  even  if  there  is  cause  and  provocation,  for \nprovocation, arising from a just cause or from an imaginary misunderstood reason, may \ncreate sufficient wrath in a man to convert him automatically into a murderer. \nAnger obliterates reasoning power and prevents the understanding mind from taking \nthe right course during a momentous issue. Anyone who is angry with his brother through \nthe misunderstanding of facts is one who is angry without reason. \nDanger of judgment suggests the Cosmic Law of action, which is based upon the \nlaw of cause and effect. This law bestows good or bad fruition to people, according to their \ngood or bad activities. \nEvery action produces a result in the form of a tendency which is lodged in the mind \nas a mental seed. This mental-tendency seed germinates into action when the proper \nwater of environment arrives. A good mental seed produces good action and a bad one \nresults in evil performance. Hence, one should be very careful how he acts, for actions \nrepeat themselves through the power of the left-over corresponding tendencies. It is all \nright when good actions are repeated, but it is disastrous when evil actions are repeated \nagainst the will of the performer. Every wrong action brings calamity from the judgment, or \nthe result proceeding from the law of cause and effect. \nAlso, anyone who calls another a “fool” shall suffer from the fire of ignorance. \nIgnorance is hell, and it burns wisdom away. To overcome the wisdom of anyone by a \nstrong suggestion of ignorance is to do them a great wrong. To cause the consuming fire of \nignorance to enter a soul is a great sin. To burn in the fire of ignorance is just as bad as \ncausing others to be consumed in the fire of ignorance. To behold ignorance in others is to \nenvelop oneself in the consuming fire of ignorance. \n“Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother \nhath aught against thee: Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way: first be \nreconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.

No one can really present a gift to God because all things belong to Him, but to \ngive unto God the gifts that are given by Him shows and appreciative heart.

It is good to please God in the heart of a \nreconciled brother first, and then offer a gift in a temple afterward. \nIt is better to become reconciled to an enemy than to be thrown into the prison of \nhatred by the anger due to inharmony. Inharmony, resulting from enmity, is the judge and \nthe officer which throws one into the prison of inner disturbance. Verily, no one can come \nout of the prison of inharmony unless he loses the last farthing of anger from within himself. \nTo behold an enemy in any soul is to eclipse the presence of God there. A wise man must \nnot lose the consciousness of the omnipresence of God by being unable to see Him hidden \nbehind the smoke screen of hatred thrown around an enemy-brother's heart. \n“Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shall not commit adultery:  \nBut I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed \nadultery with her already in his heart.

And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and \ncast it from thee, for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not \nthat thy whole body should be cast into hell.” \n(Matthew 5:27-30)\nJesus said that, not only is adultery sinful, but that, according to spiritual law, the \nlustful gaze at a woman involves the committing of adultery in the mind. It is a common \noccurrence in modern times for men to look at a beautiful woman with lustful gaze and \nyearning. Such looks from men seem to flatter some women, who dress up to draw such \nattention from men. It is not only sinful for men to bestow lustful glances on women, but it is \nsinful for women willfully to awaken sex-thoughts in men, and also to feel flattered by lustful \nattentions. \nAccording  to  human  law,  unless  there  is  physical  adultery,  no  one  can  be \ncondemned. Human law does not condemn a man for constantly indulging in mental \nadultery even to the greatest degree. But the Divine Law condemns mental adultery also \nbecause, without its first advent, physical adultery would not be possible. \nThe Hindu Scriptures speak of the following ways of committing adultery: (1) To \nthink lustfully of a woman, without the woman being present before the physical eyes, is \nadultery. (2) To talk about a woman with a lustful desire is adultery. (3) To touch a woman \nwith lustful desire is adultery. (4) To even gaze upon a woman with lustful desire is \nadultery. (5) To hold confidential talks with a woman with the ultimate hope of physical \nunion is adultery. (6) The act of physical union without marriage is adultery.\nHow many ways there are to sin, no living mortal knows. The question of sex is a \nvery puzzling one. Unless the sex-urge were given to man from within, he would not feel \nthe desire. Since physical union is the law of propagation of the species, it should not be \nused for any other purpose than that. \n21\n"}

In the \nsame way,  physical  union for procreation is all right, but to concentrate upon sense \npleasure is disastrous, for the desire can never be appeased. Indulgence is destructive to \nhealth and the nervous system, and the entire mental, neural, and spiritual faculties are \ndisturbed. \nThe vital essence lost in physical union contains microscopic atoms of intelligence \nand energy, and the indiscriminate loss of it, due to excess, is extremely harmful to spiritual \ndevelopment. \nJesus said that, as it is better to lose and eye than the whole body, so it is better to \nforego sense indulgence rather than to lose the whole soul. People who live on the \nmomentarily-alluring  sex  plane  forget  to  achieve  or  even  mentally  imagine  the  vast \nunending joys of the Spirit. \nThe mind is single-tracked. If it ever gets used to sex-habits, it is very difficult to \nmake it move in the channels of the unending happiness of meditation. It is very difficult for \nthe sex-addict to conceive of the boundless bliss of meditation. Sex-addicts are very \nnervous and restless. Their minds wander constantly, and it is very difficult for them to \nconcentrate upon the all-intoxicating, ever-new bliss of meditation. It is better that one of \nthe physical pleasures of life be destroyed than to let it annihilate the entire happiness of \nthe Spirit. \nDue to economic reasons – lack of the chaperon system, co-education, and free \nmixing of the sexes, mental and physical adultery is common in modern times. In Russia, \npeople can marry and divorce at will without cost or difficulty. Companionate marriage is \nsanctioned in many countries. \nAnimals cannot commit adultery,  even  though  they are  indiscriminate  from the \nhuman standpoint, because they have sex-union for procreation only, and are impelled by \ninstinct and nature. They do not indulge in self-created sex-thoughts. They obey the natural \nimpulse of sex just like other calls of Nature, and thus help procreation of their species. \nMan, being endowed with reason, commits sin by adding his evil, insatiable, lustful \nthoughts to the instinct of procreation. According to spiritual law, therefore, to use the sex-\ninstinct other than for procreation of the human species is considered sinful. A married man \nalso, if he thinks lustfully of his wife, commits sin, for she should be considered as a temple \nof God's creation, through which a new soul is to be born and nurtured. \nIt is true also that, for the material desire for name, fame, lust, possession, and love \nof money, people give up the entire kingdom of immortal bliss. Therefore, it is better to \ndestroy one pleasure than to lose the entire happiness of the Being. \n“It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of \ndivorcement: But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the \ncause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is  \ndivorced committeth adultery.” \n(Matthew 5:31-32)\n22\n"}

One should get married only when he finds soul unity with a proper mate. And the \ntwo thus married should stick to one another. Proper marriage gives birth to real love, \nunion on a higher plane, and does away with living on the sex-plane.  \nPeople who are constantly getting divorced and getting married again, never give \nthe divine love a chance to grow on the soil of proper matrimony. The minds of such \npeople are ever concentrated upon sex and material beauty. Hence, too many divorces for \nflimsy reasons give birth to adultery, which consists in concentrating upon sex as an end in \nitself, instead of a means to an end of procreation on the physical plane, or procreation of \nlove and emancipation on the spiritual plane. \n“Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not  \nforswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, Swear not \nat all: neither by heaven: for it is God's throne: Nor by the earth: for it is His footstool: \nneither by Jerusalem: for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy  \nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication \nbe, Yea, yea: Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.”\n(Matthew 5:33-37)\nIn olden times the Scriptures enjoined that one should not swear but taught that is \nwas permissible to give the oath of allegiance unto the Lord. However, Jesus said that is \nwas not good to swear at all, especially by using the name of heaven or earth, for heaven \nis God's transcendental chamber of blissful retirement, and the earth is the place of \nheavenly activity. God rests in the heavenly region of space hidden behind the walls of light \nrays. There God rests in eternal bliss. The earth is the footstool of God, that is, it is a place \nwhere God works with His Feet of motion and activity. Neither should one swear by \nJerusalem or any holy city, which has had the sacred manifestation of the Royal God \nthrough His saints. Neither should one swear by the head because it is the sacred abode \nof the soul. \nSwearing is the result of overworked emotion. During the mental blindness caused \nby emotion or heated argument, or anger, or false assertion, one is apt to speak untruth or \nto assert untruth violently. And to add to such impulsive untruthful statements the sacred \nname of God, or heaven, or God-created earth, or the sacred abode of saints, or the holy \nabode of the soul in the head, is sin. Do not drag down something which is holy to support \nsomething which is wrong or meaningless. \nSwearing reveals weakness of character, lack of fineness, and lack of reverence. \nSwearing  makes  one cheap  and  also  creates a cheap  atmosphere, undermining the \nsacredness of holy things and impairing the sanctity and seriousness of good souls. \nSwearing reveals that one has to resort to emotional exclamations instead of using the \nclarity of reason to prove his point. A true statement firmly asserted does not need to be \ndesecrated  by  swearing,  which  may  fasten  upon  one  the  habit  of  prevarication, \n23\n"}

And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat,  \nlet him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him \ntwain. Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou  \naway.”\n(Matthew 5:38-42)\nJesus says here that the Mosaic Law of an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, \nmay have been justified in the time when people were not very advanced spiritually. He \nsays also that the spiritual man must rise above the desire for petty revenge because \nforgiveness is a greater spiritual virtue than the wreaking of vengeance. The “eye for an \neye” law is evil, for, although apparently it seems just to injure a man who has inflicted \nsome injury on another man, this giving way to revenge does not teach right actions to the \nwrong doer, but instead it makes him more hateful, and he thinks: “I wish I had taken both \nof his eyes out, instead of one eye, so that he could not retaliate by plucking out one of my \neyes.” Hence, to wreak vengeance does not stop the recurrence of an evil act, but rather, it \nfosters countless evil thoughts and acts of vengeance. \nTherefore, Jesus speaks of not resisting evil with evil methods, but advises man to \nconquer evil through the yielding, alluring power of love. If anybody wants to satisfy his \nanger by slapping you on one cheek, and if you slap back, his anger increases and he \nwants to slap you more than ever, or kick or shoot you, while, if you willingly let him slap \nyou twice, then his wrath is quite likely to be spend and he will yield under the influence of \nyour love. Wrath is increased by wrath as fire increases by fire, but as fire is extinguished \nby water, so also, wrath is wiped away by kindliness. \nIf a man sues you and takes away some of your money, willingly give him a little \nmore than he takes away by force, then he may feel remorseful and come back to his \nsenses. \nThese spiritual laws can be completely practiced only by saints or by people living \nunder ideal conditions. If the mortgage on a house is foreclosed, a modern man cannot \ngive his home away, and he is compelled to demand justice from those who are unjust to \nhim. \nIf a man pays two thousand dollars to a blackmailer who demands one thousand, \nthat will not stop the thief, but will prompt him to come back again and demand four \nthousand. Spiritual laws, though they are eternally true, can only be followed in a more or \nless modified form according to the nature of the environment in which one lives and \nmoves. \nIf a kidnapper insists on taking his victim forty miles away from his home, he should \nnot agree to go eighty miles away until compelled to do so. The idea is that if one resists a \nkidnapper with anger and abuse, the result to the kidnapped person may be disastrous, but \n24\n"}

In order to see the omnipresent God, the \ndevotee not only should behold Him through the open portal of friendship, but should tear \nthe dark screen of hate away in order to behold Him present in the heart of enemies also. \nIt is easy to curse anyone who hates you, but curses do not stop your enemy from \nhating. They only increase his hatred toward you. Many people curse their enemies in \norder to stop their hatred, but fail to do so. If curses fail to stop hatred, why should one \ncurse and waste energy this way? It is better to use love and blessing to people who curse \nyou, so that they may change their evil way through your good example. \n25\n"}

If you hate at heart and talk love as a matter of \ndiplomacy to win your enemy, it will not work forever, for the human heart is intuitive. It is \nnot easy to deceive the human heart and its intuitive perception. Think love as you talk love \nand that will surely mollify and change your enemies even if they do not admit it outwardly. \nIt is necessary that you should really win your enemies by love. Love is a divine cleanser \nand a more lastingly effective way of winning your enemies. Hatred defeats the very \npurpose for which it is used to suppress and put down the enemies by force of hatred. \nNot only mentally love those who hate you, but actually do some good to your \nenemies if you possibly can. This is a sure way of convincing them that you love them. Do \ngood to them, even though they hate you and are willing to injure you. Even if you can in \nno way go near those who hate you in order to do good to them, pray to the omnipresent \nGod that He free them from hatred. If you cannot take away the hatred from your enemies, \nGod can do so, for He is omnipresent in the heart and mind of your enemy. If your prayer is \nsincere and strong, God will be moved to take away the hatred from your enemy's heart if \nHe thinks that is the best course for you and all concerned. \nIf your prayer to change your enemy's attitude is not heard, then know that God \nwants you to pass the test of loving your enemy while he hates you. Hate drowns your \nenemy in deeper hate, love lifts your adversary from the dark waters of hatred. \nPray for them who hate you and persecute you through lies, hateful talk, and also \nevil  actions,  for  God  can  remedy  all  inharmonious  conditions.  Those  who  love  their \nenemies are surely loved by the Heavenly Father and become like Him. As God loves His \nnaughty or good children, so also the true child of God learns to love all of his divine \nbrethren alike. As the sun shines equally on the diamond and the charcoal, so God's light \nor mercy shines equally on the good and the evil, and the rain of His helpful powers is \nshowered on the just and the unjust alike, because they are all His children. \nHowever, it must not be understood that the good and bad alike are able to receive \nGod's light so equally and justly allotted by Him. The charcoal can never reflect the same \namount of sunlight as the diamond does. In the same way, dark mentalities do not reflect \nGod as much as the good do, although God's light shines equally in them both. In other \nwords, God never deprives His unjust child because of his evil ways. He gives the same \nmeasure of love to His naughty child so that he may have a chance to recover. The \nnaughty child needs the light of God more than the good one, since he lives in self-created \ndarkness. The good child can redeem himself through the reflected and appreciated light of \nGod. In that way God is more anxious to bring his prodigal son back to His Mansion than \nHe is to the good one who is already there, having willingly gone there. \nIt also must be thoroughly borne in mind that although God in His infinite kindness \ngives as much to His wicked child as He does to His good son, the evil son cannot utilize \nthe spiritual gifts unless he changes his evil ways. That is all the more reason why the \nwicked should change their ways and appreciate the divine gift of understanding. \n26\n"}

Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is \nperfect.”\n(Matthew 5:46-48)\nEven the ordinary politician return love for love and salute for salute because of \nmaterial policy and outward courtesy. But, as the perfect Father loves His naughty or good \nchildren alike, so also you, who are seeking perfection, must love equally God's evil or \ngood children. \nMortals behave like mortals by giving in the same measure what they receive, but to \nbe like the immortal God, a soul must give love for hate, and goodness for evil actions. \nSuch action entitles mortals to become perfect and immortal beings. If God gave hate for \nhate, where would man be today? God, by giving silent love to man, is helping man's slow \nbut sure emancipation. God never loudly admonishes the wrong doer, but silently and \nlovingly talks to him through the whispers of his conscience. To become like the Father, the \nordinary self-deluded mortal must behave like the perfect Father. \n“Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them; otherwise ye \nhave no reward of your Father which is in heaven. Therefore when thou doest thine alms, \ndo not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the  \nstreets, that they may have glory of men.

But  \nwhen thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: That thine  \nalms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee  \nopenly.”\n(Matthew 6:1-4)\nSince no one owns anything, but is only given the use of things, according to the \nmeasure of his Karma (previous action) and, because of Heaven's bounty, man should \nlearn to present gifts to his brethren in secret, even as God gives sunlight, air, food, life, \nlove, and wisdom to man shrouded in utmost secrecy. Though man earns according to the \nmeasure of his ability, yet he could not get anything unless God created the things he \nneeds.  \nTherefore, all things are gifts of God, even though He makes man work for them for \nthe sake of his own evolution through struggle. Man has many needs, and he receives the \ngift of God in health, prosperity, and, above all, in spiritual qualities.

God wants His fortunate children to share His gifts with His unfortunate children, \nand God wants all gifts to be presented in secret, without marring them with repugnant \npride or publicity. If anyone gives money or wisdom to another and brags about it, he \ndestroys its sanctity. The Heavenly Law does not give the reward or revelation to bragging \nsouls. \nDo not give your material alms in pomp in the temples, and do not boastingly offer \nyour wisdom to others. Never say: “I helped to redeem such and such a person.” If you do \nso, you may receive material reward by gaining some friends and some followers, but that \nbragging will keep away wise friends and the all-wise God. \nRemember, it is necessary to show God that you are not attached to your God-given \npossessions, and that you are ready to share them with your brethren. Most people are \nwilling to offer advice and sympathy, but when it comes to sharing their hard-earned money \nwith others, they are forced to be “tightwads” with closed purse strings, believing only in \nfamily happiness – “Us four and no more.” Some people never hesitate to buy yachts and \nnew costly cars, but are very tight when it comes to giving a hundred dollars to a very \nneedy cause. There they economize and feel righteous when giving five or twenty-five \ndollars. \nTherefore, the primary lesson to be learned on earth, as exemplified by God, is to \nevery day share at least a little of your earthly possessions with worthy, needy persons, or, \nstill better, with worthy, needy Divine Causes. \nAfter you learn to give freely to others, and quietly, as you give to yourself, then the \nDivine law of supply will secretly work for you. As you lovingly, quietly, naturally, and \njoyously, without remorse, buy things for yourself, so must you learn to do the same for \nothers, in the same way. As one gives the best gifts to himself, without publicity, so one \nshould learn to give to others without ostentation. \nTo present gifts to others by identifying their necessities as your own, expands you, \nand you learn to dwell, not only in your own life, but in the lives and hearts of others also. \nThus, in the reward of Heaven, the silent giver feels God's omnipresence in other hearts, \nbut the bragging giver, though better than the miser, reaps some results due to bestowing \ngifts upon others, but his gift is tinged with the desire for display and pride, and he is \nengrossed in limiting and confining egotism, and misses the reward of Heaven, which \nconsists in self-expansion in the hearts of others, when gifts are given in silence, and by \nthe identification of self with others. Egotistic giving concentrates the mind on the false, \ninsincere applause of men, but silent giving unites the heart of the giver with the heart of \nthe one benefited, and with the Spirit of God. \nWhen you give to others, with your right hand or the right spirit, let not your left \nhand, or egotism, be conscious of it. Those who think that they are great givers are not as \ngreat as those givers who are so engrossed in giving that they have no time to think that \nthey are giving at all. If you present to others material and spiritual gifts as if you were \ngiving to yourself, then the Spirit will reward you with the perception of Omnipresence sent \nopenly into your heart. \n“And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to \npray standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen \nof men.

They use prayers, not to \nplease God, but they use prayer and God to try to make people belief in their priestly \nsanctity. Such people are hypocrites because their actions are no synchronized with their \nmotives. It is the greatest sin to use God and prayer to secure the devotion of people under \nfalse pretences. Such hypocrites, for inspiring simples, trusting people in the thought of \ngoodness, reap reward by obtaining earthly power and the devotion of blind followers, but \nGod, who sees the heart of the hypocrite, never responds to false prayers. Hypocrites are \nfoolish  to  seek  temporary  praise  by  using  God  and  prayers,  forgetting  that  the  all-\nredeeming blessing of God is to be had only by using sincere prayers in quietness. \nMost modern churches advocate prayer in public and thereby keep their members \non the outer physical plane. Such prayer may do some good, but not a great deal, and in \norder to be effective at all, it must be supplemented by deep, secret, soul-loving prayers in \nthe quietness of a closet or a room with closed doors. \nAs  the  parlor  awakens  the  social  consciousness,  the  library fosters a  reading \nconsciousness, and the bedroom suggests sleeping, so occidental people should have a \nroom or a screened-off corner, or a well-ventilated closet, for the purpose of silence \n(meditation), as most true oriental homes have. \nThe  lack  of  individual  prayer  and  communion  with  God  has  divorced  modern \nChristians and Christians sects from the real perception of God. The church should not be \na social and moral organization only. It should primarily be an academy for training in true \nGod-perception. \nMost churches, because they have no esoteric soul-lifting training, are busy with \ndogma and exclude all people with different ideas. The people who really perceive God \ninclude everybody within the path of their love. \nNot only do the Western brothers need to learn the individual method of Divine \nromanticism in seclusion, but they should learn from the East the technique of contacting \nGod in silence. \nMany people worship God in secrecy but are so hounded by their restless thoughts \nthat they do not know how to worship Him in inner secrecy. When one learns from the East \nthe method of worshipping God while secreted away from restless thoughts, then God \nrewards by openly manifesting Himself to the devout devotee. \n“But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that \nthey shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your \nFather knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. After this manner \ntherefore pray ye.”\n(Matthew 6:7-9)\n29\n"}

They make prayer a part of \nthe physical by parroting or chanting the name of God without understanding the meaning. \nIf a young man carried a portable victrola which played nothing but, “I love you,” all the time \nand used that to express his love to his beloved, then, of course, she would say, “My dear \nfriend, you are trying in vain to convince me that you love me and you don't mean it at all.” \nHence, to repeat constantly to God loudly, “God, I love you, God, I love you,” and then in \nthe background of your mind to think of something else, is fruitless and vain, for it brings no \nresponse from God.

Unceasing prayer involves repetition, not \nblind, but ever-increasing, intellectual and spiritual devotion. Therefore, do not parrot your \nprayers loudly. The parrot may be taught to repeat the name of God without knowing its \nmeaning at all. It is better to pray once deeply and understandingly and intensely than to \noffer a whole day's prayer filled with blind, meaningless repetition. \nPrayers sent out soulfully once, or many times, bring response from God. The \ndevotees who love God deeply do not have to beg God for their daily necessities, for the \nHeavenly Father will give the needed gifts to the devotees without their having to ask for \nthem. God never wants His children to beg. True children of God, who are one with the \nFather, look upon prayer as beggary because it seems to express doubt.

So do not try to \nengage your attention on two contradictory ideals – God and Mammon. Of course, it is \npossible to keep your major attention on God with your hands and part of your mind \nperforming material duties and enjoying material things.

Are ye not much better than \nthey?”\n(Matthew 6:25-26)\nTake no thought, that is, do not use up all your thoughts worrying about your life \nwhich comes from God. Do not lose your mind worrying about what you shall eat or what \nyou shall drink, or what clothes you will wear. Look how the fowls of the air, though they \nsow no grain nor reap, yet they are fed by God. In the Western world, Christian men think \nday and night of food, drink, and clothing, so much so, that at the height of selfish industrial \ncivilization, they have experienced depression and inner discontentment, being gorged with \nmateriality. Houses, money, and automobiles may be necessary to modern existence, but \nunless one gives some time to God and meditation, he can never make life happy. \nThe Aryan Hindu, on the other hand, thinks only of God and has neglected his \nmaterial life, and in spite of his spirituality is suffering from poverty, famine, sickness, and \npolitical slavery. \nThe old doctrine of complete renunciation is extreme; if people let go their duties, \nthen cities will be dens of malaria and poverty. But because people are using all their \nthoughts to make money, they have forgotten in what lies the secret of a truly happy life. \nWhat Jesus means is to put your principal thought on God – the Giver of Life and its \nnecessities  –  and  not  on  the  necessities  of  life  in  utter  oblivion  of  God.

God is the Maker \nof Life and the Creator of sunlight, grain, water, and air, which support human life. But \nbecause man does his share to acquire God-given things, he soon forgets the direct hand \nof God in all human affairs. Man cannot make grain, nor power of digestion to digest food, \nnor life which absorbs the grain chemicals into his tissues. \nLook how the lilies are attired with ethereal fragrance and beauty by God, even \nthough they make no conscious effort to spin their petalled clothing. King Solomon, with all \nhis glorious artificial royal robes, could not decorate himself like the naive lilies clothed by \nGod. \nThough almost all think first of breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and what to eat and how \nmuch money to make in order to eat and clothe properly, still it should be remembered that \nto think of the gifts of God all the time in preference to thinking of the Giver, is extremely \nwrong. \nTo think of God, the Giver, along with the struggle to acquire material things, is all \nright. The lilies are clothed directly by God and they do not have to pay for the sunshine, \nair, and soil chemicals which they require, but, in the present civilization, man has to pay \nfor his food and clothing and he could not have them given to him without his thought and \nstruggle to get them. In the Orient, when Jesus taught, people lived simply and could get \nthemselves fed and clothed without much effort through charity or family help. Nowadays, \nconditions of life are changed; civilization is more individualistic and selfish, hence man has \nto struggle for his existence and give considerable thought to his maintenance. \nThen the question comes, is it impossible to apply the above Christ doctrine in \nmodern life? No. History shows that the smartest, wealthiest individuals of all Ages, with all \ntheir thought and effort and craftiness to acquire wealth and material success from time to \ntime, have been made to wallow in the mire of poverty through the naive decree of Fate. \n33\n"}

The spiritual laws of \n“unselfishness”  and  “including  the  prosperity of others in  one's own  prosperity”  were \nbroken; hence, the advent of depression. Industrial selfishness was precipitated from dire \nhuman greed for gold, leading to unfair suicidal competition and the dumping of prices to \nkill the competitor and the all-destroying depression. Even the smartest businessmen have \nbecome children in the hands of destiny and depression, knowing not which way to turn. \nWhen the materially-minded businessman's brain is befuddled with greed, his intelligence \ninstitutes plans which fail one after the other. This is the price all materially-minded God-\nforgotten egotistic people are bound to meet sometime or other. \nThe idea is this: a businessman who keeps his mind principally concentrated upon \nthe Almighty Giver of all things would never be left without anything (unless it is for a test) \neven in the worst depression which might come along. God is the Creator and Owner of all \nfood, clothing, money, property, and life; it is He who gives all those things to man so that \nhe can maintain his life on earth. If the nations of the earth lived as brothers in the United \nStates of the World, no individual of the earth could die of starvation or go naked. But man, \nby giving artificial monetary value to production, has brought in strife between capital and \nlabor, leading to systematically recurring inflations and depressions. When a member of a \nfamily gets sick or disabled, he is not the object of charity, but he honorably shares the \nfamily food and wealth. The same should hold good for each member of the world family. \nNobody should starve because he has no job, or because he is old or disabled. \nBrain and hands both cooperate to maintain the body and equally share the food in \nthe stomach, so also capital (the brains of the society) and the labor (the working power of \nthe society) must cooperate to make life prosperous and equally share in all they produce. \nNeither capital nor labor should get special preference in an imperialistic or socialistic form \nof  government.  Capital  and  labor  have  their  eternal  place,  and  they  must  do  their \nrespective duties in equality. Everybody should be rich, or everybody get along somehow, \nequally  sharing  in  national  wealth,  or  everybody  should  be  poor  if  poverty  comes \nunavoidably through the inclemencies of Nature. There should not be some richer than \nothers. That is the root cause of crime, greed, selfishness, wars, famines, pestilence, and \nall untold social evils. \nIf nations realized that all possessions are gifts of God and that therefore all things \nshould be shared equally, then they could live centuries without wars and famine. One \nnation possessing everything side by side with another nation starving to death, can never \nkeep peace on earth. Nations must look after one another or they are doomed. That is why \nJesus speaks to the nations of the earth: “Ye nations, do not be selfish and think only of \nfood, industry, and raiment, in utter forgetfulness of brotherhood and the Giver of all things, \nGod, or ye  will  bring complete disaster on yourselves through your own  self-created \nignorance and its attendant wars, pestilence, and so forth.”\nThe prosperous nation might think: “What do we care for other nations: let us roll in \nplenty; what do we care for other starving nations dying by the millions, as long as we are \nprosperous.” Well, the people of an intelligent prosperous nation must realize that national \nprosperity depends upon natural resources, moral conduct, harmony, and spiritual living of \nthe people.

If the wise man neglects his body and starves it to dearth, he \nsins against God's laws of creation. The person who dresses, drinks, and eats to please \nhis vanity and mortal desire is divorced from God also.\nJesus asked man not to be engrossed in the thought of food and drink and raiment, \nfor God knows that man needs these things and must have them. God has created many \nvarieties of food and drink and materials for man's necessities. Since God is so thoughtful \nof man,  he  certainly  should  not  forget  God.

Perishable  material  possessions  do  not  contain  the  imperishable \nKingdom of God, of immortality and everlasting Bliss, but the imperishable Kingdom of God \ncontains in it all the perishable good of the world. Those who are foolish, seek perishable \nmaterial things first and get so accustomed to working for them, due to the enslaving habit \nof the mind, that they are unable to seek the everlasting Kingdom of God. So Jesus said to \nbe wise and not waste your effort in acquiring material things which you have to give up \nperforce at the time of death. Rather, first form the habit of acquiring the Kingdom of God, \nand if you are successful in acquiring that, you will have immortality and ever-new Bliss, \nnot only in this life but through eternity, and in addition you will also be given all the \nperishable material things which you need in this life. No businessman should turn down \nsuch an offer. \nBesides, when a soul, made in the image of God, instead of seeking immortality, \nseeks material things, he becomes a beggar and receives only a beggar's pittance, but \nsouls who seek first to return to the Kingdom of God, after being prodigal and wandering \naway from it in earthly incarnation, once again become the true children of God and \nreceive, without asking, the Heavenly children's share. To reclaim yourself as a true child \nof God is to receive all things – prosperity, immortality, and God without asking. To the true \nchild of God, the Kingdom of God is returned and all material possessions are given in \naddition, for the Kingdom of God contains in it also the Kingdom of the earth. \nOf course, just blind seeking the Kingdom of God will not do; neither will being \ncontent all your life in seeking the Divine Kingdom without receiving it get you anywhere. \nMan must know the technique of God-contact, (learned from the sages of India who have \nspecialized in it) and when the ecstatic communion with God is an established fact, then \nwill he know that with the acquirement of the celestial Kingdom, all things are within his \nreach. Jesus said: “I and my Father are One,” (and that is why He could feed five thousand \npeople  with  five  loaves  of  bread,  and  could  recreate  His  body  after  death  –  and \nachievement which no scientist has yet duplicated). Jesus had God first, so He had power \nover life and death, destiny, and all conditions. \nIt is ridiculous for man to question his Divinity, or to ask whether he can attain \nChristhood or not. Man does not need to acquire Godhood; he has only to know that he is \nmade in God's image. \n36\n"}

A complex material life is only pleasing to \nthe eyes, but few realize “what price material comforts.” Economic slavery, nervousness, \nbusiness worries, unfair competition, old age, wars, disease, lack of freedom, and misery \nand death are the harvest of a materially busy life, which is devoid of the appreciation of \nbeauty, Nature, and God in life. Then why spend all your valuable life's time seeking \nperishable things? Why not spend your time seeking God first through deep meditation \nuntil you actually contact Him, and then with His contact receive the immortal, imperishable \nthings of heaven and all the perishable things of this life which you need. \nLive with God today and He who guides the destiny of the world, including yours, will \nplan your morrow for you according to your acts of today. \nIt  is  hard  to  get  rid  of  the  evil  of  material  attachments,  and  thus  not  go  on \naccumulating seeds of evil attachment for tomorrow, but it must be done some time. \nMen seek matter first, and are duped by partially receiving perishable things. Jesus \nknew that He was one with God. That is why He had everything – control over life, matter, \nand all conditions. Therefore, do not pray for material things first, for you, as a beggar, \ncannot get what you want to possess. If you just pray to be a millionaire, I assure you no \nmatter how hard you pray you cannot be one. Do not pray as a mortal, but first know by \ndeep meditation that “you and your Father are One.” When you know this, you are richer \nthan a millionaire. Hence, if you know God, you will not need to pray, to supplicate or beg, \nfor you will become a Son of God and, being the Child of God, you will have everything \nwhich God has.\nIf you pray at all, do not pray as a mortal, for in so doing you cannot get more than \nyour mortal or beggar's share, but pray after knowing God, then you can have anything in \nHis Kingdom without supplication, on demand, as your Divine Birthright. \nDo not make the mistake, as millions of people do, of praying and praying, and \nnever  getting  anywhere.  Pray to  know God first, then pray for or demand  afterward \nanything you wish to have. That is the real way to get your prayers answered. \n37\n"}

And why \nbeholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in  \nthine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine \neye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?”\n(Matthew 7:1-4)\nDo not be critical about what other people do, so that your actions will not be taken \ninto account by others. This passage seems a sort of moral threat, to the effect that if you \nmercilessly expose the faults of others, similarly will your own faults be brought to light. In \nother words, we have no right to criticize others violently while we possess the same faults, \nfor such action brings only ridicule and anger. If a liar admonishes a lier, it has little effect. \nA judge who  has  committed  murder himself has no right to  condemn  another \nmurderer to death, for then the invisible eye of the even-handed just laws of God will bring \nthe hypocrite to judgment. It is neither good nor effective to judge others without first \nridding oneself of the same defects. Action and example speak louder than words. Loving \nsuggestion from a good person is all right if the sinner wants to become better or is \nremorseful. Truth and God only can judge fairly, for they are faultless. \nTo  reveal  the  moral  weakness  of  others  and  bring  them  to  discomfiture  and \nresentment is not the way of the wise. Cruel judgment of the wrong actions of others \nmakes one forget that the sinner is but an error-stricken child of God. Hate the sin, but not \nthe sinner, for he is a child of God in error – your own Divine brother eclipsed by ignorance. \nThe purpose of judgment must be curative only and not the revengeful outcome of anger. \nGod, who is above all base passions, is the only impartial judge and knows what is \nright. Man is apt to be revengeful and unjust when he is judging the faults of others. We \nshould treat the error-stricken as we would like to be treated if we ourselves were stricken \nwith error. In the same spirit in which we judge others does the Divine Law judge us. \nInstead of judging with harshness, we should suggest with love. Besides, those who are \nused to judging others without correcting themselves first are apt to believe falsely that \nthey are free from these same faults – just because they happen to admonish others. Of \ncourse, you can judge another with kindness for the purpose of correction. Such an act is \nall right, for the Divine Law will be kind or cruel in judging your faults, even as you are kind \nor cruel in estimating the discrepancies of others. \nTo warn others about the dangers of evil from one's own bitter experience is good if \nit is done in private with the sole desire of saving them from misery, but never tell other \npeople their faults in public. Unscrupulous people love to torture others about the vary \nfaults they themselves possess in abundance. Being divine brothers, we should not judge \nanother brother with unkindness.

A loving person does not cruelly judge and punish his \nbrother, but he criticizes with love if necessary. \nAccording to the law of cause and effect, if one is used to judging others with \nkindness, he receives the same treatment in return from Truth, which secretly governs all \nlife. In other words, only the kind, wise, and perfectly balanced individual is fit to judge. \nAccording to the psychological law of habit, if you are cruel to others, you have harbored \ncruel thoughts in yourself first, and if you are constantly cruel, you have harbored cruel \nthoughts  quite  often,  and  by  constantly  harboring  cruel  thoughts,  you  will  accustom \nyourself to being cruel. Hence, it is not good to harbor cruel thoughts about others under \nany circumstances. To be cruel to others is to attract cruelty to yourself by exciting and \nangering others. Punishment or reward is not imparted by God as an act of revenge or an \nact of special favoritism, but good and evil results are occasioned by good and evil actions. \nTo judge others cruelly is to attract cruel criticism from others, which makes your own life \nmiserable. \nIf you are blind in one eye, why call another blind brother, blind, unless you want to \ntorture or ridicule yourself? If you show kindness, you are quite likely to attract the same \nthing from others. For instance, it is ridiculous to try to heal some one of the habit of \nsmoking if you are an inveterate smoker yourself. Of course, it is all right to warn another \nbrother of the ditch of error into which you have fallen, if you do not want him to suffer \nlikewise, but to condemn publicly or to punish another for a fault which you possess is \nunjustifiable. If you are a traitor to your country, you should not admonish other traitors. If \nyou are suffering from moral sickness, do not make yourself hoarse expressing holy wrath \nagainst others who are morally weak, for then people will find out your secret errors and \nput them before the world, ridiculing your hypocrisy and inconsistency. \nWhenever you talk against another person for the love of gossip or in order to satisfy \nyour talkative instinct, remember, you will be judged by your Heavenly Father in the same \nway, for whatever you give out, the same will you attract. If you peddle the weaknesses of \nothers, the Divine Law will mysteriously bring about the publicity of your own inner faults. \nThe man suffering from theological indigestion himself cannot cure others suffering \nfrom the same malady. The theologically wise, but ignorant in Self-Realization, cannot lead \nothers into the haven of spiritual Self-Realization. Jesus and His disciples awakened God-\ncontact in many men, but many of the modern ministers cannot awaken God in people, \nbecause  they  know  not  God  themselves.  Passing  theological  examinations,  regular \npreparation and delivering of theoretical sermons, and talking in a holy voice, with emotion, \ndoes not make one God-known or make him able to transmit God to others. God's ministry \nshould  never  be  chosen  as  a  life's  work  without  knowing  God  first  in  one's  own \nconsciousness.  Even  business  ethics  demand  that  one  should  never  attempt  to  sell \nanything without a thorough acquaintance with the article and faith in its usefulness. Then \nwhy try to sell God to others without knowing or believing at all what God is and how He \ncan be useful to all in the supreme way?\n“Judge not, that ye be not judged.” Jesus refers here mostly to sex immorality, which \nis due to bad pre-natal or postnatal habits, or to bad company. There is a compulsion of \nthe physical sex force by which people are led astray. However, because some persons \nhabitually have no sex desire, that does not make them saints, for they may have a very \nwicked,  insincere  heart.

A \nman who is innocent because of lack of experience may succumb to temptation whenever \nit first comes to him. Of all evils, beware of the habit of remaining on the sex plane in \nthought or action, for it is one of the most difficult sense desires to be controlled, regulated, \nand subjugated. \nTherefore, if you are suffering from immorality, you have no right to judge other \nimmoral people. To judge does not signify that you should not warn an innocent person or \na slightly immoral individual of the dangers of forming bad habits. If you judge others only \nto help them or to correct them without hurting them by exposure, or gossip, or scolding, or \ntaunting, then such judgment is all right. \nJudging is of different kinds. “For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged.” \n“What judgment” signifies judging people in order to audaciously hurt them or bring them to \nridicule. Even to punish evil people quietly in such a way that they will try to reform \nthemselves, is all right. The court judge punishes criminal for the sake of all society, as well \nas for their own good, so that they will not perform greater and greater crimes. But, to \npunish people just to satisfy wrath, or for any other wrong purpose, is evil. \nGossip, either for pleasure or through force of habit, never heals the person talked \nabout; it only ruffles him, makes him mad, steeped in despair, ashamed, and strengthens \nhis determination to continue to be evil. There is a proverb which says: “The one who has \nlost one ear goes through the village at the side, showing the villagers his best ear, and \nhiding the lost ear. But he who has lost both ears, goes through the center of the village, \nbecause he cannot hide from anyone.”\nAny  person  whose  moral  errors  are  unduly exposed,  becomes  desperate  and \nshameless, like the man who lost both ears, and thus he makes no effort to be better. That \nis why you must not judge with an evil intention or judge in a way to harm the person \njudged. \n“Judge ye not others; judge yourself.” If you happen to love to talk loudly about the \nfaults of others, then satisfy that lust by loudly talking about your own private secret faults, \nand see how you like it even for a minute. Now, if you cannot stand one minute's publicity \nabout your own faults, then you must not in any way rejoice in exposing others. \nBesides, the evil you tell about others becomes exaggerated and people are ready \nto crucify the condemned person without judging the circumstances which led him to be \nmorally weak. To talk about the secret faults of others, is to make them lose the desire to \nbe good. Of course, in rare cases, the fear of publicity keeps some people good, but \npublicity about a person's fault makes him desperate and makes him lose the desire to be \ngood. Also,  a little  weakness  in  a  person, through  publicity,  often  becomes big  and \nuniversally known, whereas people with far greater weaknesses, because of not being \ndetected, go unchecked. \nIf there is plenty of mental dirt in your own inner home, get busy and clean it out and \ndo not waste time in talking about the mental dirt existing in others.

Before \nyou aspire to take the mote from your brother's eye, you should first take it out of your own \neye.

Those who have acquired fortunes by selling the \nname of God, or who have cast out evil from people in imagination only, or have performed \nspiritual miracles according to their own deluded estimation only, will not be able to enter \ninto the Kingdom of Eternal Bliss. \nAll  mechanical  church-and-temple-goers,  and  all  theological  students,  must \nremember  that  verbal  praise  to  the  Lord  without  His  corresponding  response  and \ntheological study without gaining Self-Realization, is of little value in the eyes of God. The \nprinciples governing divine life are exact, like those of any other branch of science in God's \nCreation. People who want to be Christians must know and feel the presence of Christ all \nthe time, must commune with Him in ecstasy, and be guided by Him and know that He is, \nand ever will be, and not just somehow be superficially satisfied by uttering the name of the \nLord a few times every day without knowing whether the Lord actually exists or responds. If \nJesus and God ever existed, they exist now and ever will exist. If they are perpetually \nexistent, then that Truth must be verified in the lives of all Truth-loving Christians. \nThose who profess Christianity and teach it, without knowing or trying to feel the \npresence of Christ in meditation, are blaspheming by their iniquity and are not accepted \ninto the eternal Bliss in Christ Consciousness. \n46\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - The Sermon on the Mount interpretted by (47p).pdf", "page": 47, "text": "“Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken \nhim unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended and the  \nfloods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house: and it fell not: for it was  \nfounded upon a rock.”\n(Matthew 7:24-25)\nHe who listens to the advice of Jesus Christ, and lives it, is settled in the home of \nlasting Bliss, founded on the rock of eternally intuitive wisdom. Such a wise man's spiritual \nBliss is never destroyed by the rain of difficult spiritual trials or the advent of the flood of \naccumulated sorrowful events, or the mighty wind of death. The soul's house of Bliss, built \non the lofty rock of meditative intuition, can outlast all the rain of trials, floods of miseries, \nand even the storm of death. The Bliss acquired by meditation becomes a permanent \nmansion of the soul, which not even the most-dreaded death can destroy. \nThe Bhagavad Gita says: “Not even the direst suffering can shake the equanimity of \nthe wise man. He stands unshaken amidst the crash of breaking worlds.” So, do not \nestablish your happiness on the temporal pleasures of life, for it will soon be blown away \nby the trials of life, but instead, found your happiness in God as perceived in meditation, \nand your joy will be everlasting.\n“And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be  \nlikened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: And the rain descended, \nand the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house: and it fell: and great \nwas the fall of it.”\n(Matthew 7:26-27)\nEveryone who reads the Christian Bible on Sunday mornings only, but leads a \ncareless life patterned after the dictates of his impulses throughout the rest of the week, is \nlike the man who built his house on sand. If anyone tries to feel security in financial \nacquirement and in temporary sense-pleasures, he will lose his happiness during the trials \nof disease, the changes of fortune, and at the advent of death. Happiness based upon \nsense-pleasures is like a house built upon sand. As the house built upon sand cannot exist \nthrough rain, flood, wind, so the temporary happiness based upon sense-pleasures does \nnot last during the rain of physical disease, or the rain of mental troubles, or during the \ngreat storm of death. Death shatters the little mental home of earthly happiness, but the \ndance macabre can never shatter the home of ever-new Bliss built upon the rock of \nintuitive meditation. People who live for earthly happiness only are extremely disillusioned \nat the time of death, when everything they loved and considered to be everlastingly their \nown, is taken away from them. \n“And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were \nastonished at his doctrine. For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the \nscribes.”\n(Matthew 7:28-29)\n47\n"}
