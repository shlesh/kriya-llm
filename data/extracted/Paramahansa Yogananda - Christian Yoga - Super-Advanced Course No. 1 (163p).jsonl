When you \nsee a rope in the dark, you may think you are seeing a snake. \nYour inferences are often mistaken, because your intelligence \ncan reach its conclusions only through the data supplied by \nthe senses. If the senses mislead you, your inferences are \nnecessarily wrong. Intuition, on the other hand, does not de .. \npend on intelligence or sense perception. At times you have \na feeling that something is going to happen.
