He was then the head of a quiet ashrama \nnear the seashore there, and was chiefly occupied in the spiritual training \nof a group of youthful disciples. He expressed keen interest in the \nwelfare of the people of the United States and of all the Americas, and \nof England, too, and questioned me concerning the distant activities, \nparticularly those in California, of his chief disciple, Paramhansa \nYogananda, whom he dearly loved, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as his \nemissary to the West.  \nSri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence, and \nworthy of the veneration which his followers spontaneously accorded to \nhim. Every person who knew him, whether of his own community or not, \nheld him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic \nfigure, garbed in the saffron-colored garb of one who has renounced \nworldly quests, as he stood at the entrance of the hermitage to give me \nwelcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His \nbody was muscularly firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step \nenergetic. He had chosen as his place of earthly abode the holy city of \nPuri, whither multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of every province \nof India, come daily on pilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath, \n\"Lord of the World.\" It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed his mortal \neyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transitory state of being and passed \non, knowing that his incarnation had been carried to a triumphant \ncompletion. I am glad, indeed, to be able to record this testimony to the \nhigh character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar. Content to remain afar \nfrom the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly and in tranquillity to \nthat ideal life which Paramhansa Yogananda, his disciple, has now \ndescribed for the ages. W. Y.

My \nown path led me to a Christlike sage whose beautiful life was chiseled for \nthe ages. He was one of the great masters who are India's sole remaining \nwealth. Emerging in every generation, they have bulwarked their land \nagainst the fate of Babylon and Egypt.  \nI find my earliest memories covering the anachronistic features of a \nprevious incarnation. Clear recollections came to me of a distant life, a \nyogi 1-3 amidst the Himalayan snows. These glimpses of the past, by some \ndimensionless link, also afforded me a glimpse of the future.  \nThe helpless humiliations of infancy are not banished from my mind. I was \nresentfully conscious of not being able to walk or express myself freely. \nPrayerful surges arose within me as I realized my bodily impotence. My \nstrong emotional life took silent form as words in many languages. Among \nthe inward confusion of tongues, my ear gradually accustomed itself to \nthe circumambient Bengali syllables of my people. The beguiling scope of \nan infant's mind! adultly considered limited to toys and toes.  \nPsychological ferment and my unresponsive body brought me to many \nobstinate crying-spells. I recall the general family bewilderment at my \ndistress. Happier memories, too, crowd in on me: my mother's caresses, \nand my first attempts at lisping phrase and toddling step. These early \ntriumphs, usually forgotten quickly, are yet a natural basis of self-\nconfidence.  \nMy far-reaching memories are not unique. Many yogis are known to have \nretained their self-consciousness without interruption by the dramatic \ntransition to and from \"life\" and \"death.\" If man be solely a body, its loss \nindeed places the final period to identity. But if prophets down the \nmillenniums spoke with truth, man is essentially of incorporeal nature. The \npersistent core of human egoity is only temporarily allied with sense \nperception.  \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (1946 ed) (463p).pdf", "page": 8, "text": "Although odd, clear memories of infancy are not extremely rare. During \ntravels in numerous lands, I have listened to early recollections from the \nlips of veracious men and women.  \nI was born in the last decade of the nineteenth century, and passed my \nfirst eight years at Gorakhpur. This was my birthplace in the United \nProvinces of northeastern India. We were eight children: four boys and \nfour girls. I, Mukunda Lal Ghosh 1-4, was the second son and the fourth \nchild.  \nFather and Mother were Bengalis, of the kshatriya caste. 1-5 Both were \nblessed with saintly nature. Their mutual love, tranquil and dignified, \nnever expressed itself frivolously. A perfect parental harmony was the \ncalm center for the revolving tumult of eight young lives.  \nFather, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, was kind, grave, at times stern. Loving \nhim dearly, we children yet observed a certain reverential distance. An \noutstanding mathematician and logician, he was guided principally by his \nintellect. But Mother was a queen of hearts, and taught us only through \nlove. After her death, Father displayed more of his inner tenderness. I \nnoticed then that his gaze often metamorphosed into my mother's.  \nIn Mother's presence we tasted our earliest bitter-sweet acquaintance \nwith the scriptures. Tales from the mahabharata and ramayana 1-6 were \nresourcefully summoned to meet the exigencies of discipline. Instruction \nand chastisement went hand in hand.  \nA daily gesture of respect to Father was given by Mother's dressing us \ncarefully in the afternoons to welcome him home from the office. His \nposition was similar to that of a vice-president, in the Bengal-Nagpur \nRailway, one of India's large companies. His work involved traveling, and \nour family lived in several cities during my childhood.  \nMother held an open hand toward the needy. Father was also kindly \ndisposed, but his respect for law and order extended to the budget. One \nfortnight Mother spent, in feeding the poor, more than Father's monthly \nincome.  \n\"All I ask, please, is to keep your charities within a reasonable limit.\" Even \na gentle rebuke from her husband was grievous to Mother. She ordered a \nhackney carriage, not hinting to the children at any disagreement.  \n\"Good-by; I am going away to my mother's home.\" Ancient ultimatum!  \n"}

Our maternal uncle arrived \nopportunely; he whispered to Father some sage counsel, garnered no \ndoubt from the ages. After Father had made a few conciliatory remarks, \nMother happily dismissed the cab. Thus ended the only trouble I ever \nnoticed between my parents. But I recall a characteristic discussion.  \n\"Please give me ten rupees for a hapless woman who has just arrived at \nthe house.\" Mother's smile had its own persuasion.  \n\"Why ten rupees? One is enough.\" Father added a justification: \"When my \nfather and grandparents died suddenly, I had my first taste of poverty. \nMy only breakfast, before walking miles to my school, was a small banana. \nLater, at the university, I was in such need that I applied to a wealthy \njudge for aid of one rupee per month. He declined, remarking that even a \nrupee is important.\"  \n\"How bitterly you recall the denial of that rupee!\" Mother's heart had an \ninstant logic. \"Do you want this woman also to remember painfully your \nrefusal of ten rupees which she needs urgently?\"  \n\"You win!\" With the immemorial gesture of vanquished husbands, he \nopened his wallet. \"Here is a ten-rupee note. Give it to her with my good \nwill.\"  \nFather tended to first say \"No\" to any new proposal. His attitude toward \nthe strange woman who so readily enlisted Mother's sympathy was an \nexample of his customary caution. Aversion to instant acceptance- typical \nof the French mind in the West-is really only honoring the principle of \n\"due reflection.\" I always found Father reasonable and evenly balanced in \nhis judgments. If I could bolster up my numerous requests with one or \ntwo good arguments, he invariably put the coveted goal within my reach, \nwhether it were a vacation trip or a new motorcycle.  \nFather was a strict disciplinarian to his children in their early years, but \nhis attitude toward himself was truly Spartan. He never visited the \ntheater, for instance, but sought his recreation in various spiritual \npractices and in reading the bhagavad gita. 1-7 Shunning all luxuries, he \nwould cling to one old pair of shoes until they were useless. His sons \nbought automobiles after they came into popular use, but Father was \nalways content with the trolley car for his daily ride to the office. The \naccumulation of money for the sake of power was alien to his nature. \nOnce, after organizing the Calcutta Urban Bank, he refused to benefit \n"}

Owing to him as back compensation.\" \nThe officials presented Father with a check for this amount. He thought \nso little about it that he overlooked any mention to the family. Much later \nhe was questioned by my youngest brother Bishnu, who noticed the large \ndeposit on a bank statement.  \n\"Why be elated by material profit?\" Father replied. \"The one who pursues \na goal of evenmindedness is neither jubilant with gain nor depressed by \nloss.

Abinash instructed \nmy young ears with engrossing tales of many Indian saints. He invariably \nconcluded with a tribute to the superior glories of his own guru.  \n\"Did you ever hear of the extraordinary circumstances under which your \nfather became a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya?\"  \nIt was on a lazy summer afternoon, as Abinash and I sat together in the \ncompound of my home, that he put this intriguing question. I shook my \nhead with a smile of anticipation.  \n\"Years ago, before you were born, I asked my superior officer-your \nfather-to give me a week's leave from my Gorakhpur duties in order to \nvisit my guru in Benares. Your father ridiculed my plan.  \n\"'Are you going to become a religious fanatic?' he inquired. 'Concentrate \non your office work if you want to forge ahead.'  \n\"Sadly walking home along a woodland path that day, I met your father in \na palanquin. He dismissed his servants and conveyance, and fell into step \nbeside me. Seeking to console me, he pointed out the advantages of \nstriving for worldly success. But I heard him listlessly. My heart was \nrepeating: 'Lahiri Mahasaya! I cannot live without seeing you!'  \n\"Our path took us to the edge of a tranquil field, where the rays of the \nlate afternoon sun were still crowning the tall ripple of the wild grass. We \npaused in admiration. There in the field, only a few yards from us, the \nform of my great guru suddenly appeared! 1-9  \n\"'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His voice was resonant in \nour astounded ears. He vanished as mysteriously as he had come. On my \nknees I was exclaiming, 'Lahiri Mahasaya! Lahiri Mahasaya!' Your father \nwas motionless with stupefaction for a few moments.  \n\"'Abinash, not only do I give you leave, but I give myself leave to start \nfor Benares tomorrow. I must know this great Lahiri Mahasaya, who is \nable to materialize himself at will in order to intercede for you! I will \n"}

Joy filled me at the miraculous answer to my prayer, and \nthe quick, favorable turn of events.  \n\"The next evening your parents and I entrained for Benares. We took a \nhorse cart the following day, and then had to walk through narrow lanes \nto my guru's secluded home. Entering his little parlor, we bowed before \nthe master, enlocked in his habitual lotus posture. He blinked his piercing \neyes and leveled them on your father.  \n\"'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His words were the same \nas those he had used two days before in the Gorakhpur field. He added, \n'I am glad that you have allowed Abinash to visit me, and that you and \nyour wife have accompanied him.'  \n\"To their joy, he initiated your parents in the spiritual practice of Kriya \nYoga. 1-10 Your father and I, as brother disciples, have been close friends \nsince the memorable day of the vision. Lahiri Mahasaya took a definite \ninterest in your own birth. Your life shall surely be linked with his own: \nthe master's blessing never fails.\"  \nLahiri Mahasaya left this world shortly after I had entered it. His \npicture, in an ornate frame, always graced our family altar in the various \ncities to which Father was transferred by his office. Many a morning and \nevening found Mother and me meditating before an improvised shrine, \noffering flowers dipped in fragrant sandalwood paste. With frankincense \nand myrrh as well as our united devotions, we honored the divinity which \nhad found full expression in Lahiri Mahasaya.  \nHis picture had a surpassing influence over my life. As I grew, the \nthought of the master grew with me. In meditation I would often see his \nphotographic image emerge from its small frame and, taking a living form, \nsit before me. When I attempted to touch the feet of his luminous body, \nit would change and again become the picture. As childhood slipped into \nboyhood, I found Lahiri Mahasaya transformed in my mind from a little \nimage, cribbed in a frame, to a living, enlightening presence. I frequently \nprayed to him in moments of trial or confusion, finding within me his \nsolacing direction. At first I grieved because he was no longer physically \nliving. As I began to discover his secret omnipresence, I lamented no \nmore. He had often written to those of his disciples who were over-\n"}

This experience gave intensification to \nmy love. While at our family estate in Ichapur, Bengal, I was stricken with \nAsiatic cholera. My life was despaired of; the doctors could do nothing. \nAt my bedside, Mother frantically motioned me to look at Lahiri \nMahasaya's picture on the wall above my head.  \n\"Bow to him mentally!\" She knew I was too feeble even to lift my hands in \nsalutation. \"If you really show your devotion and inwardly kneel before \nhim, your life will be spared!\"  \nI gazed at his photograph and saw there a blinding light, enveloping my \nbody and the entire room. My nausea and other uncontrollable symptoms \ndisappeared; I was well. At once I felt strong enough to bend over and \ntouch Mother's feet in appreciation of her immeasurable faith in her \nguru. Mother pressed her head repeatedly against the little picture.  \n\"O Omnipresent Master, I thank thee that thy light hath healed my son!\"  \nI realized that she too had witnessed the luminous blaze through which I \nhad instantly recovered from a usually fatal disease.  \nOne of my most precious possessions is that same photograph. Given to \nFather by Lahiri Mahasaya himself, it carries a holy vibration. The picture \nhad a miraculous origin. I heard the story from Father's brother disciple, \nKali Kumar Roy.  \nIt appears that the master had an aversion to being photographed. Over \nhis protest, a group picture was once taken of him and a cluster of \ndevotees, including Kali Kumar Roy. It was an amazed photographer who \ndiscovered that the plate which had clear images of all the disciples, \nrevealed nothing more than a blank space in the center where he had \nreasonably expected to find the outlines of Lahiri Mahasaya. The \nphenomenon was widely discussed.  \nA certain student and expert photographer, Ganga Dhar Babu, boasted \nthat the fugitive figure would not escape him. The next morning, as the \nguru sat in lotus posture on a wooden bench with a screen behind him, \nGanga Dhar Babu arrived with his equipment. Taking every precaution for \nsuccess, he greedily exposed twelve plates. On each one he soon found \n"}

It \nwas many hours before Lahiri Mahasaya broke his silence with a pregnant \ncomment:  \n\"I am Spirit. Can your camera reflect the omnipresent Invisible?\"  \n\"I see it cannot! But, Holy Sir, I lovingly desire a picture of the bodily \ntemple where alone, to my narrow vision, that Spirit appears fully to \ndwell.\"  \n\"Come, then, tomorrow morning. I will pose for you.\"  \nAgain the photographer focused his camera. This time the sacred figure, \nnot cloaked with mysterious imperceptibility, was sharp on the plate. The \nmaster never posed for another picture; at least, I have seen none.  \nThe photograph is reproduced in this book. Lahiri Mahasaya's fair \nfeatures, of a universal cast, hardly suggest to what race he belonged. \nHis intense joy of God-communion is slightly revealed in a somewhat \nenigmatic smile. His eyes, half open to denote a nominal direction on the \nouter world, are half closed also. Completely oblivious to the poor lures of \nthe earth, he was fully awake at all times to the spiritual problems of \nseekers who approached for his bounty.  \nShortly after my healing through the potency of the guru's picture, I had \nan influential spiritual vision. Sitting on my bed one morning, I fell into a \ndeep reverie.  \n\"What is behind the darkness of closed eyes?\" This probing thought came \npowerfully into my mind. An immense flash of light at once manifested to \nmy inward gaze. Divine shapes of saints, sitting in meditation posture in \nmountain caves, formed like miniature cinema pictures on the large screen \nof radiance within my forehead.  \n\"Who are you?\" I spoke aloud.  \n\"We are the Himalayan yogis.\" The celestial response is difficult to \ndescribe; my heart was thrilled.  \n"}

My elder sister Uma and I were seated in the early \nmorning under a neem tree in our Gorakhpur compound. She was helping \nme with a Bengali primer, what time I could spare my gaze from the near-\nby parrots eating ripe margosa fruit. Uma complained of a boil on her leg, \nand fetched a jar of ointment.

An adamant \nresolution sounded in my voice as I made slow reply.  \n\"By the power of will in me, I say that tomorrow I shall have a fairly large \nboil in this exact place on my arm; and your boil shall swell to twice its \npresent size!\"  \nMorning found me with a stalwart boil on the indicated spot; the \ndimensions of Uma's boil had doubled.

I understood, \nlater, that the explosive vibratory power in speech could be wisely \ndirected to free one's life from difficulties, and thus operate without \nscar or rebuke. 1-12  \nOur family moved to Lahore in the Punjab. There I acquired a picture of \nthe Divine Mother in the form of the Goddess Kali. 1-13 It sanctified a \nsmall informal shrine on the balcony of our home. An unequivocal \nconviction came over me that fulfillment would crown any of my prayers \nuttered in that sacred spot.

We had chosen the \nfollowing day for our flight. Precautions were necessary, as Ananta \nexercised a vigilant eye. He was determined to foil the plans of escape \nwhich he suspected were uppermost in my mind. The amulet, like a \nspiritual yeast, was silently at work within me. Amidst the Himalayan \nsnows, I hoped to find the master whose face often appeared to me in \nvisions.  \nThe family was living now in Calcutta, where Father had been permanently \ntransferred.

Hearing the wheels \nof Amar's carriage in the road, I hastily tied together a blanket, a pair of \nsandals, Lahiri Mahasaya's picture, a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, a string \nof prayer beads, and two loincloths. This bundle I threw from my third-\nstory window. I ran down the steps and passed my uncle, buying fish at \nthe door.  \n\"What is the excitement?\" His gaze roved suspiciously over my person.  \nI gave him a noncommittal smile and walked to the lane. Retrieving my \nbundle, I joined Amar with conspiratorial caution. We drove to Chadni \nChowk, a merchandise center. For months we had been saving our tiffin \nmoney to buy English clothes. Knowing that my clever brother could easily \nplay the part of a detective, we thought to outwit him by European garb.  \nOn the way to the station, we stopped for my cousin, Jotin Ghosh, whom I \ncalled Jatinda. He was a new convert, longing for a guru in the Himalayas. \nHe donned the new suit we had in readiness. Well- camouflaged, we hoped! \nA deep elation possessed our hearts.  \n\"All we need now are canvas shoes.\" I led my companions to a shop \ndisplaying rubber-soled footwear. \"Articles of leather, gotten only \nthrough the slaughter of animals, must be absent on this holy trip.\" I \nhalted on the street to remove the leather cover from my Bhagavad Gita, \nand the leather straps from my English-made sola topee (helmet).  \nAt the station we bought tickets to Burdwan, where we planned to \ntransfer for Hardwar in the Himalayan foothills. As soon as the train, like \nourselves, was in flight, I gave utterance to a few of my glorious \nanticipations.  \n\"Just imagine!\" I ejaculated. \"We shall be initiated by the masters and \nexperience the trance of cosmic consciousness. Our flesh will be charged \nwith such magnetism that wild animals of the Himalayas will come tamely \nnear us. Tigers will be no more than meek house cats awaiting our \ncaresses!\"  \nThis remark-picturing a prospect I considered entrancing, both \nmetaphorically and literally-brought an enthusiastic smile from Amar.

At dusk our train stopped at Burdwan. Jatinda \nentered the ticket office; Amar and I sat on the platform. We waited \nfifteen minutes, then made unavailing inquiries. Searching in all \ndirections, we shouted Jatinda's name with the urgency of fright. But he \nhad faded into the dark unknown surrounding the little station.  \nI was completely unnerved, shocked to a peculiar numbness. That God \nwould countenance this depressing episode! The romantic occasion of my \nfirst carefully-planned flight after Him was cruelly marred.  \n\"Amar, we must return home.\" I was weeping like a child. \"Jatinda's \ncallous departure is an ill omen. This trip is doomed to failure.\"  \n\"Is this your love for the Lord? Can't you stand the little test of a \ntreacherous companion?\"  \nThrough Amar's suggestion of a divine test, my heart steadied itself. We \nrefreshed ourselves with famous Burdwan sweetmeats, sitabhog (food for \nthe goddess) and motichur (nuggets of sweet pearl). In a few hours, we \nentrained for Hardwar, via Bareilly. Changing trains at Moghul Serai, we \ndiscussed a vital matter as we waited on the platform.  \n\"Amar, we may soon be closely questioned by railroad officials. I am not \nunderrating my brother's ingenuity! No matter what the outcome, I will \nnot speak untruth.\"  \n\"All I ask of you, Mukunda, is to keep still.

He waved a \ntelegram whose import I immediately grasped.  \n\"Are you running away from home in anger?\"  \n"}

The duel of wits that followed hardly \npermitted me to maintain the counseled stoic gravity.  \n\"Where is the third boy?\" The man injected a full ring of authority into \nhis voice. \"Come on; speak the truth!\"  \n\"Sir, I notice you are wearing eyeglasses. Can't you see that we are only \ntwo?\" Amar smiled impudently. \"I am not a magician; I can't conjure up a \nthird companion.\"  \nThe official, noticeably disconcerted by this impertinence, sought a new \nfield of attack.  \n\"What is your name?\"  \n\"I am called Thomas. I am the son of an English mother and a converted \nChristian Indian father.\"  \n\"What is your friend's name?\"  \n\"I call him Thompson.\"  \nBy this time my inward mirth had reached a zenith; I unceremoniously \nmade for the train, whistling for departure. Amar followed with the \nofficial, who was credulous and obliging enough to put us into a European \ncompartment. It evidently pained him to think of two half- English boys \ntraveling in the section allotted to natives. After his polite exit, I lay \nback on the seat and laughed uncontrollably. My friend wore an \nexpression of blithe satisfaction at having outwitted a veteran European \nofficial.  \nOn the platform I had contrived to read the telegram. From my brother, \nit went thus: \"Three Bengali boys in English clothes running away from \nhome toward Hardwar via Moghul Serai. Please detain them until my \narrival. Ample reward for your services.\"  \n\"Amar, I told you not to leave marked timetables in your home.\" My glance \nwas reproachful. \"Brother must have found one there.\"  \n"}

As on a previous occasion, Dwarka \nrefused my invitation to set forth to the Himalayas.  \nWhile our train stood in a station that night, and I was half asleep, Amar \nwas awakened by another questioning official. He, too, fell a victim to the \nhybrid charms of \"Thomas\" and \"Thompson.\" The train bore us \ntriumphantly into a dawn arrival at Hardwar. The majestic mountains \nloomed invitingly in the distance. We dashed through the station and \nentered the freedom of city crowds. Our first act was to change into \nnative costume, as Ananta had somehow penetrated our European \ndisguise. A premonition of capture weighed on my mind.  \nDeeming it advisable to leave Hardwar at once, we bought tickets to \nproceed north to Rishikesh, a soil long hallowed by feet of many masters. \nI had already boarded the train, while Amar lagged on the platform. He \nwas brought to an abrupt halt by a shout from a policeman. Our \nunwelcome guardian escorted us to a station bungalow and took charge of \nour money. He explained courteously that it was his duty to hold us until \nmy elder brother arrived.  \nLearning that the truants' destination had been the Himalayas, the \nofficer related a strange story.  \n\"I see you are crazy about saints! You will never meet a greater man of \nGod than the one I saw only yesterday. My brother officer and I first \nencountered him five days ago. We were patrolling by the Ganges, on a \nsharp lookout for a certain murderer. Our instructions were to capture \nhim, alive or dead. He was known to be masquerading as a sadhu in order \nto rob pilgrims. A short way before us, we spied a figure which resembled \nthe description of the criminal. He ignored our command to stop; we ran \nto overpower him. Approaching his back, I wielded my ax with tremendous \nforce; the man's right arm was severed almost completely from his body.  \n\"Without outcry or any glance at the ghastly wound, the stranger \nastonishingly continued his swift pace. As we jumped in front of him, he \nspoke quietly.  \n\"'I am not the murderer you are seeking.'  \n"}

The saint \nregarded me kindly. 'Run along, and don't reproach yourself. The Beloved \nMother is taking care of me.'

In my \nabsence, he had lovingly hatched a plot by arranging for a saintly pundit, \nSwami Kebalananda, 4-5 to come regularly to the house.  \n\"The sage will be your Sanskrit tutor,\" my parent announced confidently.  \nFather hoped to satisfy my religious yearnings by instructions from a \nlearned philosopher. But the tables were subtly turned: my new teacher, \nfar from offering intellectual aridities, fanned the embers of my God-\naspiration. Unknown to Father, Swami Kebalananda was an exalted disciple \nof Lahiri Mahasaya.

I learned later that Lahiri Mahasaya had often characterized \nKebalananda as rishi or illumined sage.  \nLuxuriant curls framed my tutor's handsome face. His dark eyes were \nguileless, with the transparency of a child's. All the movements of his \nslight body were marked by a restful deliberation. Ever gentle and loving, \nhe was firmly established in the infinite consciousness. Many of our happy \nhours together were spent in deep Kriya meditation.  \nKebalananda was a noted authority on the ancient shastras or sacred \nbooks: his erudition had earned him the title of \"Shastri Mahasaya,\" by \nwhich he was usually addressed. But my progress in Sanskrit scholarship \nwas unnoteworthy. I sought every opportunity to forsake prosaic \ngrammar and to talk of yoga and Lahiri Mahasaya. My tutor obliged me \none day by telling me something of his own life with the master.  \n\"Rarely fortunate, I was able to remain near Lahiri Mahasaya for ten \nyears.

Never have my eyes been blessed with a glimpse of \nthe sun.'  \n\"'Our omnipotent guru can help you. Please make a supplication.'  \n\"The following day Ramu diffidently approached Lahiri Mahasaya. The \ndisciple felt almost ashamed to ask that physical wealth be added to his \nspiritual superabundance.  \n\"'Master, the Illuminator of the cosmos is in you. I pray you to bring His \nlight into my eyes, that I perceive the sun's lesser glow.'  \n\"'Ramu, someone has connived to put me in a difficult position. I have no \nhealing power.'  \n\"'Sir, the Infinite One within you can certainly heal.'  \n\"'That is indeed different, Ramu. God's limit is nowhere!

Everything else is complex. Do not seek absolute values in \nthe relative world of nature.\"  \nThese philosophical finalities gently entered my ear as I stood silently \nbefore a temple image of Kali. Turning, I confronted a tall man whose \ngarb, or lack of it, revealed him a wandering sadhu.  \n\"You have indeed penetrated the bewilderment of my thoughts!\" I smiled \ngratefully. \"The confusion of benign and terrible aspects in nature, as \nsymbolized by Kali, 5-1 has puzzled wiser heads than mine!\"  \n\"Few there be who solve her mystery!

This demon-tiger was \nsupposed to be the one sent to humble me.  \n\"Another imaginative version was that animal prayers to Tiger Heaven had \nachieved a response in the shape of Raja Begum. He was to be the \ninstrument to punish me-the audacious biped, so insulting to the entire \ntiger species! A furless, fangless man daring to challenge a claw-armed, \nsturdy-limbed tiger! The concentrated venom of all humiliated tigers-the \nvillagers declared-had gathered momentum sufficient to operate hidden \nlaws and bring about the fall of the proud tiger tamer.  \n\"My servant further apprized me that the prince was in his element as \nmanager of the bout between man and beast. He had supervised the \nerection of a storm-proof pavilion, designed to accommodate thousands. \nIts center held Raja Begum in an enormous iron cage, surrounded by an \nouter safety room. The captive emitted a ceaseless series of blood- \n"}

He was fed sparingly, to kindle a wrathful appetite. \nPerhaps the prince expected me to be the meal of reward!  \n\"Crowds from the city and suburbs bought tickets eagerly in response to \nthe beat of drums announcing the unique contest. The day of battle saw \nhundreds turned away for lack of seats. Many men broke through the \ntent openings, or crowded any space below the galleries.\"  \nAs the Tiger Swami's story approached a climax, my excitement mounted \nwith it; Chandi also was raptly mute.  \n\"Amidst piercing sound-explosions from Raja Begum, and the hubbub of \nthe somewhat terrified crowd, I quietly made my appearance. Scantily \nclad around the waist, I was otherwise unprotected by clothing. I opened \nthe bolt on the door of the safety room and calmly locked it behind me. \nThe tiger sensed blood. Leaping with a thunderous crash on his bars, he \nsent forth a fearsome welcome. The audience was hushed with pitiful \nfear; I seemed a meek lamb before the raging beast.  \n\"In a trice I was within the cage; but as I slammed the door, Raja Begum \nwas headlong upon me. My right hand was desperately torn. Human blood, \nthe greatest treat a tiger can know, fell in appalling streams. The \nprophecy of the saint seemed about to be fulfilled.  \n\"I rallied instantly from the shock of the first serious injury I had ever \nreceived. Banishing the sight of my gory fingers by thrusting them \nbeneath my waist cloth, I swung my left arm in a bone-cracking blow. The \nbeast reeled back, swirled around the rear of the cage, and sprang \nforward convulsively. My famous fistic punishment rained on his head.  \n\"But Raja Begum's taste of blood had acted like the maddening first sip \nof wine to a dipsomaniac long-deprived. Punctuated by deafening roar, the \nbrute's assaults grew in fury. My inadequate defense of only one hand \nleft me vulnerable before claws and fangs. But I dealt out dazing \nretribution. Mutually ensanguined, we struggled as to the death. The cage \nwas pandemonium, as blood splashed in all directions, and blasts of pain \nand lethal lust came from the bestial throat.  \n\"'Shoot him!' 'Kill the tiger!' Shrieks arose from the audience. So fast \ndid man and beast move, that a guard's bullet went amiss. I mustered all \nmy will force, bellowed fiercely, and landed a final concussive blow. The \ntiger collapsed and lay quietly.  \n"}

His royal pride was further humbled: \nwith my lacerated hands, I audaciously forced open his jaws. For a \ndramatic moment, I held my head within the yawning deathtrap. I looked \naround for a chain. Pulling one from a pile on the floor, I bound the tiger \nby his neck to the cage bars. In triumph I moved toward the door.  \n\"But that fiend incarnate, Raja Begum, had stamina worthy of his \nsupposed demoniac origin. With an incredible lunge, he snapped the chain \nand leaped on my back. My shoulder fast in his jaws, I fell violently. But in \na trice I had him pinned beneath me. Under merciless blows, the \ntreacherous animal sank into semiconsciousness. This time I secured him \nmore carefully. Slowly I left the cage.  \n\"I found myself in a new uproar, this time one of delight. The crowd's \ncheer broke as though from a single gigantic throat. Disastrously mauled, \nI had yet fulfilled the three conditions of the fight-stunning the tiger, \nbinding him with a chain, and leaving him without requiring assistance for \nmyself. In addition, I had so drastically injured and frightened the \naggressive beast that he had been content to overlook the opportune \nprize of my head in his mouth!  \n\"After my wounds were treated, I was honored and garlanded; hundreds \nof gold pieces showered at my feet. The whole city entered a holiday \nperiod. Endless discussions were heard on all sides about my victory over \none of the largest and most savage tigers ever seen. Raja Begum was \npresented to me, as promised, but I felt no elation. A spiritual change had \nentered my heart. It seemed that with my final exit from the cage I had \nalso closed the door on my worldly ambitions.  \n\"A woeful period followed. For six months I lay near death from blood \npoisoning. As soon as I was well enough to leave Cooch Behar, I returned \nto my native town.  \n\"'I know now that my teacher is the holy man who gave the wise warning.' \nI humbly made this confession to my father. 'Oh, if I could only find him!' \nMy longing was sincere, for one day the saint arrived unheralded.  \n"}

The life-pulse in metals is seriously harmed or even \nextinguished through the application of electric currents or heavy \npressure.\"  \nI looked around the room at the numerous inventions, eloquent testimony \nof a tireless ingenuity.  \n\"Sir, it is lamentable that mass agricultural development is not speeded \nby fuller use of your marvelous mechanisms. Would it not be easily \npossible to employ some of them in quick laboratory experiments to \nindicate the influence of various types of fertilizers on plant growth?\"  \n\"You are right. Countless uses of Bose instruments will be made by future \ngenerations. The scientist seldom knows contemporaneous reward; it is \nenough to possess the joy of creative service.\"  \nWith expressions of unreserved gratitude to the indefatigable sage, I \ntook my leave. \"Can the astonishing fertility of his genius ever be \nexhausted?\" I thought.  \nNo diminution came with the years. Inventing an intricate instrument, the \n\"Resonant Cardiograph,\" Bose then pursued extensive researches on \ninnumerable Indian plants. An enormous unsuspected pharmacopoeia of \nuseful drugs was revealed. The cardiograph is constructed with an \nunerring accuracy by which a one-hundredth part of a second is indicated \non a graph. Resonant records measure infinitesimal pulsations in plant, \nanimal and human structure. The great botanist predicted that use of his \ncardiograph will lead to vivisection on plants instead of animals.  \n"}

Experimentation on vegetation will contribute to lessening of human \nsuffering.\"  \nYears later Bose's pioneer plant findings were substantiated by other \nscientists. Work done in 1938 at Columbia University was reported by The \nNew York Times as follows:  \nIt has been determined within the past few years that when the nerves \ntransmit messages between the brain and other parts of the body, tiny \nelectrical impulses are being generated. These impulses have been \nmeasured by delicate galvanometers and magnified millions of times by \nmodern amplifying apparatus. Until now no satisfactory method had been \nfound to study the passages of the impulses along the nerve fibers in \nliving animals or man because of the great speed with which these \nimpulses travel.  \nDrs. K. S. Cole and H. J. Curtis reported having discovered that the long \nsingle cells of the fresh-water plant nitella, used frequently in goldfish \nbowls, are virtually identical with those of single nerve fibers. \nFurthermore, they found that nitella fibers, on being excited, propagate \nelectrical waves that are similar in every way, except velocity, to those of \nthe nerve fibers in animals and man. The electrical nerve impulses in the \nplant were found to be much slower than those in animals. This discovery \nwas therefore seized upon by the Columbia workers as a means for taking \nslow motion pictures of the passage of the electrical impulses in nerves.  \nThe nitella plant thus may become a sort of Rosetta stone for deciphering \nthe closely guarded secrets close to the very borderland of mind and \nmatter.  \nThe poet Rabindranath Tagore was a stalwart friend of India's idealistic \nscientist. To him, the sweet Bengali singer addressed the following lines: \n8-6  \n  O Hermit, call thou in the authentic words \n  Of that old hymn called sama; \"Rise! Awake!\" \n  Call to the man who boasts his shastric lore \n  From vain pedantic wranglings profitless, \n  Call to that foolish braggart to come forth \n  Out on the face of nature, this broad earth, \n"}

The angelic appearance of \nMaster Mahasaya fairly dazzled me. With silky white beard and large \nlustrous eyes, he seemed an incarnation of purity. His upraised chin and \nfolded hands apprized me that my first visit had disturbed him in the \nmidst of his devotions.  \nHis simple words of greeting produced the most violent effect my nature \nhad so far experienced. The bitter separation of my mother's death I \nhad thought the measure of all anguish. Now an agony at separation from \nmy Divine Mother was an indescribable torture of the spirit. I fell \nmoaning to the floor.  \n\"Little sir, quiet yourself!\" The saint was sympathetically distressed.  \nAbandoned in some oceanic desolation, I clutched his feet as the sole \nraft of my rescue.  \n\"Holy sir, thy intercession! Ask Divine Mother if I find any favor in Her \nsight!\"  \nThis promise is one not easily bestowed; the master was constrained to \nsilence.  \nBeyond reach of doubt, I was convinced that Master Mahasaya was in \nintimate converse with the Universal Mother. It was deep humiliation to \nrealize that my eyes were blind to Her who even at this moment was \nperceptible to the faultless gaze of the saint. Shamelessly gripping his \nfeet, deaf to his gentle remonstrances, I besought him again and again \nfor his intervening grace.  \n\"I will make your plea to the Beloved.\" The master's capitulation came \nwith a slow, compassionate smile.  \nWhat power in those few words, that my being should know release from \nits stormy exile?  \n\"Sir, remember your pledge! I shall return soon for Her message!\" Joyful \nanticipation rang in my voice that only a moment ago had been sobbing in \nsorrow.  \nDescending the long stairway, I was overwhelmed by memories.

The \ndarkness of the warm Indian night was suddenly lit with a wondrous \nvision.  \nHaloed in splendor, the Divine Mother stood before me. Her face, \ntenderly smiling, was beauty itself.  \n\"Always have I loved thee! Ever shall I love thee!\"  \nThe celestial tones still ringing in the air, She disappeared.  \nThe sun on the following morning had hardly risen to an angle of decorum \nwhen I paid my second visit to Master Mahasaya. Climbing the staircase in \nthe house of poignant memories, I reached his fourth- floor room. The \nknob of the closed door was wrapped around with a cloth; a hint, I felt, \nthat the saint desired privacy. As I stood irresolutely on the landing, the \ndoor was opened by the master's welcoming hand. I knelt at his holy feet. \nIn a playful mood, I wore a solemn mask over my face, hiding the divine \nelation.  \n\"Sir, I have come-very early, I confess!-for your message.

Apparently my assumed gravity was \nunimpressive.  \n\"Why so mysterious, so evasive?

His role in the world was humble, as \nbefitted the greatest man of humility I ever knew. In this Amherst \nStreet house, Master Mahasaya 9-1 conducted a small high school for \nboys. No words of chastisement passed his lips; no rule and ferule \nmaintained his discipline.

The manna characteristically exuded by this tree was symbolic of \nthe heavenly food Master Mahasaya was bestowing. His divine invocations \ncontinued.

My gaze was astonished by the rapid approach of \nMaster Mahasaya. \"Sir, how come you here?\"  \nThe saint, ignoring my question, answered my thought. \"Isn't it true, little \nsir, that the Beloved's name sounds sweet from all lips, ignorant or wise?\" \nHe passed his arm around me affectionately; I found myself carried on \nhis magic carpet to the Merciful Presence.  \n\"Would you like to see some bioscopes?\" This question one afternoon \nfrom Master Mahasaya was mystifying; the term was then used in India \nto signify motion pictures. I agreed, glad to be in his company in any \ncircumstances. A brisk walk brought us to the garden fronting Calcutta \nUniversity. My companion indicated a bench near the goldighi or pond.  \n\"Let us sit here for a few minutes. My Master always asked me to \nmeditate whenever I saw an expanse of water.

It \nproved abysmally dull, though varied occasionally by lantern slide \nillustrations, equally uninteresting.  \n\"So this is the kind of bioscope the master wanted me to see!\" My \nthought was impatient, yet I would not hurt the saint by revealing \nboredom in my face. But he leaned toward me confidentially.  \n\"I see, little sir, that you don't like this bioscope. I have mentioned it to \nDivine Mother; She is in full sympathy with us both.

He gently slapped my chest over the \nheart.  \nA transforming silence ensued. Just as the modern \"talkies\" become \ninaudible motion pictures when the sound apparatus goes out of order, so \nthe Divine Hand, by some strange miracle, stifled the earthly bustle. The \npedestrians as well as the passing trolley cars, automobiles, bullock carts, \nand iron-wheeled hackney carriages were all in noiseless transit. As \nthough possessing an omnipresent eye, I beheld the scenes which were \nbehind me, and to each side, as easily as those in front. The whole \nspectacle of activity in that small section of Calcutta passed before me \nwithout a sound.

Several \nboys, friends of mine, approached and passed on; though they had looked \ndirectly at me, it was without recognition.  \nThe unique pantomime brought me an inexpressible ecstasy. I drank deep \nfrom some blissful fount. Suddenly my chest received another soft blow \nfrom Master Mahasaya. The pandemonium of the world burst upon my \nunwilling ears. I staggered, as though harshly awakened from a gossamer \ndream. The transcendental wine removed beyond my reach.  \n\"Little sir, I see you found the second bioscope to your liking.\" The saint \nwas smiling; I started to drop in gratitude on the ground before him. \"You \ncan't do that to me now; you know God is in your temple also! I won't let \nDivine Mother touch my feet through your hands!\"  \nIf anyone observed the unpretentious master and myself as we walked \naway from the crowded pavement, the onlooker surely suspected us of \nintoxication.

Gone were the \nCalcutta years when I could rebuke the cook for a ten-minute delay. Now \nI tried to control my appetite; one day I undertook a twenty-four hour \nfast. With double zest I awaited the following midday.  \n\"Dyanandaji's train is late; we are not going to eat until he arrives.\" \nJitendra brought me this devastating news. As gesture of welcome to the \nswami, who had been absent for two weeks, many delicacies were in \nreadiness. An appetizing aroma filled the air. Nothing else offering, what \nelse could be swallowed except pride over yesterday's achievement of a \nfast?  \n"}

Divine \nAttention was elsewhere, however; the plodding clock covered the hours. \nDarkness was descending as our leader entered the door. My greeting was \none of unfeigned joy.  \n\"Dyanandaji will bathe and meditate before we can serve food.\" Jitendra \napproached me again as a bird of ill omen.  \nI was in near-collapse. My young stomach, new to deprivation, protested \nwith gnawing vigor. Pictures I had seen of famine victims passed \nwraithlike before me.  \n\"The next Benares death from starvation is due at once in this \nhermitage,\" I thought. Impending doom averted at nine o'clock. Ambrosial \nsummons! In memory that meal is vivid as one of life's perfect hours.  \nIntense absorption yet permitted me to observe that Dyananda ate \nabsent-mindedly. He was apparently above my gross pleasures.  \n\"Swamiji, weren't you hungry?\" Happily surfeited, I was alone with the \nleader in his study.  \n\"O yes! I have spent the last four days without food or drink. I never eat \non trains, filled with the heterogenous vibrations of worldly people. \nStrictly I observe the shastric 10-6 rules for monks of my particular \norder.  \n\"Certain problems of our organizational work lie on my mind. Tonight at \nhome I neglected my dinner. What's the hurry? Tomorrow I'll make it a \npoint to have a proper meal.\" He laughed merrily.  \nShame spread within me like a suffocation. But the past day of my \ntorture was not easily forgotten; I ventured a further remark.  \n\"Swamiji, I am puzzled. Following your instruction, suppose I never asked \nfor food, and nobody gives me any. I should starve to death.\"  \n\"Die then!\" This alarming counsel split the air. \"Die if you must Mukunda! \nNever admit that you live by the power of food and not by the power of \nGod! He who has created every form of nourishment, He who has \nbestowed appetite, will certainly see that His devotee is sustained!

Gone was an age- \nold delusion by which bodily imperatives outwit the soul. There and then I \ntasted the Spirit's all-sufficiency. In how many strange cities, in my later \nlife of ceaseless travel, did occasion arise to prove the serviceability of \nthis lesson in a Benares hermitage!  \nThe sole treasure which had accompanied me from Calcutta was the \nSADHU'S silver amulet bequeathed to me by Mother. Guarding it for \nyears, I now had it carefully hidden in my ashram room. To renew my joy \nin the talismanic testimony, one morning I opened the locked box. The \nsealed covering untouched, lo! the amulet was gone. Mournfully I tore \nopen its envelope and made unmistakably sure. It had vanished, in \naccordance with the SADHU'S prediction, into the ether whence he had \nsummoned it.  \nMy relationship with Dyananda's followers grew steadily worse. The \nhousehold was alienated, hurt by my determined aloofness. My strict \nadherence to meditation on the very Ideal for which I had left home and \nall worldly ambitions called forth shallow criticism on all sides.  \nTorn by spiritual anguish, I entered the attic one dawn, resolved to pray \nuntil answer was vouchsafed.  \n\"Merciful Mother of the Universe, teach me Thyself through visions, or \nthrough a guru sent by Thee!\"  \nThe passing hours found my sobbing pleas without response. Suddenly I \nfelt lifted as though bodily to a sphere uncircumscribed.  \n\"Thy Master cometh today!\" A divine womanly voice came from \neverywhere and nowhere.  \nThis supernal experience was pierced by a shout from a definite locale. A \nyoung priest nicknamed Habu was calling me from the downstairs kitchen.  \n\"Mukunda, enough of meditation! You are needed for an errand.\"  \n"}

Together Habu and I set \nout for a distant market place in the Bengali section of Benares. The \nungentle Indian sun was not yet at zenith as we made our purchases in the \nbazaars. We pushed our way through the colorful medley of housewives, \nguides, priests, simply-clad widows, dignified Brahmins, and the ubiquitous \nholy bulls. Passing an inconspicuous lane, I turned my head and surveyed \nthe narrow length.  \nA Christlike man in the ocher robes of a swami stood motionless at the \nend of the road. Instantly and anciently familiar he seemed; my gaze fed \nhungrily for a trice. Then doubt assailed me.  \n\"You are confusing this wandering monk with someone known to you,\" I \nthought. \"Dreamer, walk on.\"  \nAfter ten minutes, I felt heavy numbness in my feet. As though turned to \nstone, they were unable to carry me farther. Laboriously I turned around; \nmy feet regained normalcy. I faced the opposite direction; again the \ncurious weight oppressed me.  \n\"The saint is magnetically drawing me to him!\" With this thought, I \nheaped my parcels into the arms of Habu. He had been observing my \nerratic footwork with amazement, and now burst into laughter.  \n\"What ails you? Are you crazy?\"  \nMy tumultuous emotion prevented any retort; I sped silently away.  \nRetracing my steps as though wing-shod, I reached the narrow lane. My \nquick glance revealed the quiet figure, steadily gazing in my direction. A \nfew eager steps and I was at his feet.  \n\"Gurudeva!\" 10-7 The divine face was none other than he of my thousand \nvisions. These halcyon eyes, in leonine head with pointed beard and \nflowing locks, had oft peered through gloom of my nocturnal reveries, \nholding a promise I had not fully understood.  \n\"O my own, you have come to me!\" My guru uttered the words again and \nagain in Bengali, his voice tremulous with joy. \"How many years I have \nwaited for you!\"  \n"}

This was not the first sun to find me at \nthese holy feet!  \nMy hand in his, my guru led me to his temporary residence in the Rana \nMahal section of the city. His athletic figure moved with firm tread. Tall, \nerect, about fifty-five at this time, he was active and vigorous as a young \nman. His dark eyes were large, beautiful with plumbless wisdom. Slightly \ncurly hair softened a face of striking power. Strength mingled subtly with \ngentleness.  \nAs we made our way to the stone balcony of a house overlooking the \nGanges, he said affectionately:  \n\"I will give you my hermitages and all I possess.\"  \n\"Sir, I come for wisdom and God-contact.

The \nflux of the human heart is gone forever at the transfixing touch of pure \nlove.\" He added humbly, \"If ever you find me falling from a state of God-\nrealization, please promise to put my head on your lap and help to bring \nme back to the Cosmic Beloved we both worship.\"  \n"}

Be faithful in your \npractice; you will approach the Guru of all gurus.\"  \n\"I am transported to find this yogic key, long sought!\" Pratap spoke \nthoughtfully. \"Its unshackling effect on my sensory bonds will free me \nfor higher spheres. The vision today of Lord Krishna could only mean my \nhighest good.\"  \nWe sat awhile in silent understanding, then walked slowly to the station. \nJoy was within me as I boarded the train, but this was Jitendra's day for \ntears. My affectionate farewell to Pratap had been punctuated by stifled \nsobs from both my companions. The journey once more found Jitendra in \na welter of grief. Not for himself this time, but against himself.  \n\"How shallow my trust! My heart has been stone! Never in future shall I \ndoubt God's protection!\"  \n"}

Its people will lend ears more \nreceptive to India's ancient wisdom if the strange Hindu teacher has a \nuniversity degree.\"  \n\"You know best, Guruji.\" My gloom departed. The reference to the West \nI found puzzling, remote; but my opportunity to please Master by \nobedience was vitally immediate.  \n\"You will be near in Calcutta; come here whenever you find time.\"  \n\"Every day if possible, Master! Gratefully I accept your authority in \nevery detail of my life-on one condition.\"  \n\"Yes?\"  \n\"That you promise to reveal God to me!\"  \nAn hour-long verbal tussle ensued. A master's word cannot be falsified; it \nis not lightly given. The implications in the pledge open out vast \nmetaphysical vistas.

Soul-homage sped to the \npeerless master who, blessing my infancy, had guided my steps to this \nhour.  \nLed by my guru, I strolled over the house and its grounds. Large, ancient \nand well-built, the hermitage was surrounded by a massive- pillared \ncourtyard. Outer walls were moss-covered; pigeons fluttered over the \nflat gray roof, unceremoniously sharing the ashram quarters. A rear \ngarden was pleasant with jackfruit, mango, and plantain trees. \nBalustraded balconies of upper rooms in the two-storied building faced \nthe courtyard from three sides. A spacious ground-floor hall, with high \nceiling supported by colonnades, was used, Master said, chiefly during the \nannual festivities of Durgapuja. 12-1 A narrow stairway led to Sri \nYukteswar's sitting room, whose small balcony overlooked the street. The \nashram was plainly furnished; everything was simple, clean, and utilitarian. \nSeveral Western styled chairs, benches, and tables were in evidence.  \nMaster invited me to stay overnight. A supper of vegetable curry was \nserved by two young disciples who were receiving hermitage training.  \n\"Guruji, please tell me something of your life.\" I was squatting on a straw \nmat near his tiger skin. The friendly stars were very close, it seemed, \nbeyond the balcony.  \n\"My family name was Priya Nath Karar. I was born 12-2 here in Serampore, \nwhere Father was a wealthy businessman. He left me this ancestral \nmansion, now my hermitage. My formal schooling was little; I found it slow \nand shallow. In early manhood, I undertook the responsibilities of a \nhouseholder, and have one daughter, now married. My middle life was \nblessed with the guidance of Lahiri Mahasaya. After my wife died, I \njoined the Swami Order and received the new name of Sri Yukteswar Giri. \n12-3 Such are my simple annals.\"  \nMaster smiled at my eager face. Like all biographical sketches, his words \nhad given the outward facts without revealing the inner man.  \n\"Guruji, I would like to hear some stories of your childhood.\"  \n"}

I went there immediately, \nand expressed my disappointment at having missed the ghost. Mother \nnever told me another horror-tale. Moral: Look fear in the face and it will \ncease to trouble you.  \n\"Another early memory is my wish for an ugly dog belonging to a neighbor. \nI kept my household in turmoil for weeks to get that dog. My ears were \ndeaf to offers of pets with more prepossessing appearance. Moral: \nAttachment is blinding; it lends an imaginary halo of attractiveness to the \nobject of desire.  \n\"A third story concerns the plasticity of the youthful mind. I heard my \nmother remark occasionally: 'A man who accepts a job under anyone is a \nslave.' That impression became so indelibly fixed that even after my \nmarriage I refused all positions. I met expenses by investing my family \nendowment in land. Moral: Good and positive suggestions should instruct \nthe sensitive ears of children. Their early ideas long remain sharply \netched.\"  \nMaster fell into tranquil silence. Around midnight he led me to a narrow \ncot. Sleep was sound and sweet the first night under my guru's roof.  \nSri Yukteswar chose the following morning to grant me his Kriya Yoga \ninitiation. The technique I had already received from two disciples of \nLahiri Mahasaya-Father and my tutor, Swami Kebalananda-but in Master's \npresence I felt transforming power. At his touch, a great light broke \nupon my being, like glory of countless suns blazing together. A flood of \nineffable bliss, overwhelming my heart to an innermost core, continued \nduring the following day. It was late that afternoon before I could bring \nmyself to leave the hermitage.  \n\"You will return in thirty days.\" As I reached my Calcutta home, the \nfulfillment of Master's prediction entered with me. None of my relatives \nmade the pointed remarks I had feared about the reappearance of the \n\"soaring bird.\"  \nI climbed to my little attic and bestowed affectionate glances, as though \non a living presence. \"You have witnessed my meditations, and the tears \nand storms of my sadhana.

My prayers \nhave been answered: you have not in your search for God been \npermanently removed from my sight.\"  \nFather was also pleased that my formal studies would be resumed; he \nmade suitable arrangements. I was enrolled the following day at the \nScottish Church College in Calcutta.  \nHappy months sped by. My readers have doubtless made the \nperspicacious surmise that I was little seen in the college classrooms. The \nSerampore hermitage held a lure too irresistible. Master accepted my \nubiquitous presence without comment. To my relief, he seldom referred \nto the halls of learning. Though it was plain to all that I was never cut out \nfor a scholar, I managed to attain minimum passing grades from time to \ntime.  \nDaily life at the ashram flowed smoothly, infrequently varied. My guru \nawoke before dawn. Lying down, or sometimes sitting on the bed, he \nentered a state of samadhi. 12-4 It was simplicity itself to discover when \nMaster had awakened: abrupt halt of stupendous snores. 12-5 A sigh or \ntwo; perhaps a bodily movement. Then a soundless state of \nbreathlessness: he was in deep yogic joy.  \nBreakfast did not follow; first came a long walk by the Ganges. Those \nmorning strolls with my guru-how real and vivid still! In the easy \nresurrection of memory, I often find myself by his side: the early sun is \nwarming the river. His voice rings out, rich with the authenticity of \nwisdom.  \nA bath; then the midday meal. Its preparation, according to Master's \ndaily directions, had been the careful task of young disciples. My guru \nwas a vegetarian. Before embracing monkhood, however, he had eaten \neggs and fish. His advice to students was to follow any simple diet which \nproved suited to one's constitution.  \nMaster ate little; often rice, colored with turmeric or juice of beets or \nspinach and lightly sprinkled with buffalo ghee or melted butter. Another \nday he might have lentil-dhal or channa 12-6 curry with vegetables. For \ndessert, mangoes or oranges with rice pudding, or jackfruit juice.  \n"}

Masters have escaped \nmaya; its alternating faces of intellect and idiocy no longer cast an \ninfluential glance. Sri Yukteswar showed no special consideration to those \nwho happened to be powerful or accomplished; neither did he slight \nothers for their poverty or illiteracy.

His every utterance was measured and chiseled by wisdom. \nA sublime self-assurance marked his mode of expression: it was unique. \nHe spoke as none other in my experience ever spoke. His thoughts were \nweighed in a delicate balance of discrimination before he permitted them \nan outward garb. The essence of truth, all-pervasive with even a \nphysiological aspect, came from him like a fragrant exudation of the soul. \nI was conscious always that I was in the presence of a living \nmanifestation of God. The weight of his divinity automatically bowed my \nhead before him.  \nIf late guests detected that Sri Yukteswar was becoming engrossed with \nthe Infinite, he quickly engaged them in conversation. He was incapable of \nstriking a pose, or of flaunting his inner withdrawal. Always one with the \nLord, he needed no separate time for communion. A self-realized master \nhas already left behind the stepping stone of meditation. \"The flower \nfalls when the fruit appears.\" But saints often cling to spiritual forms for \nthe encouragement of disciples.  \nAs midnight approached, my guru might fall into a doze with the \nnaturalness of a child. There was no fuss about bedding. He often lay \ndown, without even a pillow, on a narrow davenport which was the \nbackground for his customary tiger-skin seat.  \nA night-long philosophical discussion was not rare; any disciple could \nsummon it by intensity of interest. I felt no tiredness then, no desire for \nsleep; Master's living words were sufficient. \"Oh, it is dawn! Let us walk \nby the Ganges.\" So ended many of my periods of nocturnal edification.  \nMy early months with Sri Yukteswar culminated in a useful lesson-\"How to \nOutwit a Mosquito.\" At home my family always used protective curtains at \nnight. I was dismayed to discover that in the Serampore hermitage this \nprudent custom was honored in the breach. Yet the insects were in full \nresidency; I was bitten from head to foot. My guru took pity on me.  \n\"Buy yourself a curtain, and also one for me.\" He laughed and added, \"If \nyou buy only one, for yourself, all mosquitoes will concentrate on me!\"  \nI was more than thankful to comply. Every night that I spent in \nSerampore, my guru would ask me to arrange the bedtime curtains.  \n"}

But Master failed to \nissue his usual instructions. I listened nervously to the anticipatory hum \nof the insects. Getting into bed, I threw a propitiatory prayer in their \ngeneral direction. A half hour later, I coughed pretentiously to attract \nmy guru's attention. I thought I would go mad with the bites and \nespecially the singing drone as the mosquitoes celebrated bloodthirsty \nrites.  \nNo responsive stir from Master; I approached him cautiously. He was not \nbreathing. This was my first observation of him in the yogic trance; it \nfilled me with fright.  \n\"His heart must have failed!\" I placed a mirror under his nose; no breath-\nvapor appeared. To make doubly certain, for minutes I closed his mouth \nand nostrils with my fingers. His body was cold and motionless. In a daze, \nI turned toward the door to summon help.  \n\"So! A budding experimentalist! My poor nose!\" Master's voice was shaky \nwith laughter. \"Why don't you go to bed? Is the whole world going to \nchange for you? Change yourself: be rid of the mosquito consciousness.\"  \nMeekly I returned to my bed. Not one insect ventured near. I realized \nthat my guru had previously agreed to the curtains only to please me; he \nhad no fear of mosquitoes. His yogic power was such that he either could \nwill them not to bite, or could escape to an inner invulnerability.  \n\"He was giving me a demonstration,\" I thought. \"That is the yogic state I \nmust strive to attain.\" A yogi must be able to pass into, and continue in, \nthe superconsciousness, regardless of multitudinous distractions never \nabsent from this earth. Whether in the buzz of insects or the pervasive \nglare of daylight, the testimony of the senses must be barred. Sound and \nsight come then indeed, but to worlds fairer than the banished Eden. 12-7  \nThe instructive mosquitoes served for another early lesson at the \nashram. It was the gentle hour of dusk. My guru was matchlessly \ninterpreting the ancient texts. At his feet, I was in perfect peace. A \nrude mosquito entered the idyl and competed for my attention. As it dug \na poisonous hypodermic needle into my thigh, I automatically raised an \navenging hand. Reprieve from impending execution! An opportune memory \ncame to me of one of Patanjali's yoga aphorisms-that on ahimsa \n(harmlessness).  \n"}

Do you advocate taking life?\"  \n\"No; but the deathblow already had been struck in your mind.\"  \n\"I don't understand.\"  \n\"Patanjali's meaning was the removal of desire to kill.\" Sri Yukteswar had \nfound my mental processes an open book. \"This world is inconveniently \narranged for a literal practice of ahimsa. Man may be compelled to \nexterminate harmful creatures. He is not under similar compulsion to feel \nanger or animosity. All forms of life have equal right to the air of maya. \nThe saint who uncovers the secret of creation will be in harmony with its \ncountless bewildering expressions. All men may approach that \nunderstanding who curb the inner passion for destruction.\"  \n\"Guruji, should one offer himself a sacrifice rather than kill a wild \nbeast?\"  \n\"No; man's body is precious. It has the highest evolutionary value because \nof unique brain and spinal centers. These enable the advanced devotee to \nfully grasp and express the loftiest aspects of divinity. No lower form is \nso equipped. It is true that one incurs the debt of a minor sin if he is \nforced to kill an animal or any living thing. But the Vedas teach that \nwanton loss of a human body is a serious transgression against the karmic \nlaw.\"  \nI sighed in relief; scriptural reinforcement of one's natural instincts is \nnot always forthcoming.  \nIt so happened that I never saw Master at close quarters with a leopard \nor a tiger. But a deadly cobra once confronted him, only to be conquered \nby my guru's love. This variety of snake is much feared in India, where it \ncauses more than five thousand deaths annually. The dangerous encounter \ntook place at Puri, where Sri Yukteswar had a second hermitage, \ncharmingly situated near the Bay of Bengal. Prafulla, a young disciple of \nlater years, was with Master on this occasion.  \n\"We were seated outdoors near the ashram,\" Prafulla told me. \"A cobra \nappeared near-by, a four-foot length of sheer terror.

That my sunken eyes and emaciated \nappearance were far from my liking was testified to by rows of tonics in \nmy room at Calcutta. Nothing availed; chronic dyspepsia had pursued me \nsince childhood. My despair reached an occasional zenith when I asked \nmyself if it were worth-while to carry on this life with a body so unsound.  \n\"Medicines have limitations; the creative life-force has none. Believe \nthat: you shall be well and strong.\"  \nSri Yukteswar's words aroused a conviction of personally-applicable truth \nwhich no other healer-and I had tried many!-had been able to summon \nwithin me.  \nDay by day, behold! I waxed. Two weeks after Master's hidden blessing, I \nhad accumulated the invigorating weight which eluded me in the past. My \npersistent stomach ailments vanished with a lifelong permanency. On later \noccasions I witnessed my guru's instantaneous divine healings of persons \nsuffering from ominous disease-tuberculosis, diabetes, epilepsy, or \nparalysis. Not one could have been more grateful for his cure than I was \nat sudden freedom from my cadaverous aspect.  \n\"Years ago, I too was anxious to put on weight,\" Sri Yukteswar told me. \n\"During convalescence after a severe illness, I visited Lahiri Mahasaya in \nBenares.  \n\"'Sir, I have been very sick and lost many pounds.'  \n"}

Since early youth I had had enigmatic glimpses of \nthree buildings, each in a different setting. In the exact sequence Sri \nYukteswar had indicated, these visions took ultimate form. First came my \nfounding of a boys' yoga school on a Ranchi plain, then my American \nheadquarters on a Los Angeles hilltop, finally a hermitage in southern \nCalifornia by the vast Pacific.  \nMaster never arrogantly asserted: \"I prophesy that such and such an \nevent shall occur!\" He would rather hint: \"Don't you think it may happen?\" \nBut his simple speech hid vatic power. There was no recanting; never did \nhis slightly veiled words prove false.  \nSri Yukteswar was reserved and matter-of-fact in demeanor. There was \nnaught of the vague or daft visionary about him. His feet were firm on \nthe earth, his head in the haven of heaven. Practical people aroused his \nadmiration. \"Saintliness is not dumbness! Divine perceptions are not \nincapacitating!\" he would say. \"The active expression of virtue gives rise \nto the keenest intelligence.\"  \nIn Master's life I fully discovered the cleavage between spiritual realism \nand the obscure mysticism that spuriously passes as a counterpart. My \nguru was reluctant to discuss the superphysical realms. His only \n\"marvelous\" aura was one of perfect simplicity. In conversation he \navoided startling references; in action he was freely expressive. Others \ntalked of miracles but could manifest nothing; Sri Yukteswar seldom \nmentioned the subtle laws but secretly operated them at will.  \n\"A man of realization does not perform any miracle until he receives an \ninward sanction,\" Master explained. \"God does not wish the secrets of His \ncreation revealed promiscuously. 12-12 Also, every individual in the world \n"}

A saint will not encroach upon that \nindependence.\"  \nThe silence habitual to Sri Yukteswar was caused by his deep perceptions \nof the Infinite. No time remained for the interminable \"revelations\" that \noccupy the days of teachers without self- realization. \"In shallow men the \nfish of little thoughts cause much commotion. In oceanic minds the \nwhales of inspiration make hardly a ruffle.\" This observation from the \nHindu scriptures is not without discerning humor.  \nBecause of my guru's unspectacular guise, only a few of his \ncontemporaries recognized him as a superman. The popular adage: \"He is a \nfool that cannot conceal his wisdom,\" could never be applied to Sri \nYukteswar. Though born a mortal like all others, Master had achieved \nidentity with the Ruler of time and space. In his life I perceived a godlike \nunity. He had not found any insuperable obstacle to mergence of human \nwith Divine. No such barrier exists, I came to understand, save in man's \nspiritual unadventurousness.  \nI always thrilled at the touch of Sri Yukteswar's holy feet. Yogis teach \nthat a disciple is spiritually magnetized by reverent contact with a \nmaster; a subtle current is generated. The devotee's undesirable habit-\nmechanisms in the brain are often cauterized; the groove of his worldly \ntendencies beneficially disturbed. Momentarily at least he may find the \nsecret veils of maya lifting, and glimpse the reality of bliss. My whole \nbody responded with a liberating glow whenever I knelt in the Indian \nfashion before my guru.  \n\"Even when Lahiri Mahasaya was silent,\" Master told me, \"or when he \nconversed on other than strictly religious topics, I discovered that \nnonetheless he had transmitted to me ineffable knowledge.\"  \nSri Yukteswar affected me similarly. If I entered the hermitage in a \nworried or indifferent frame of mind, my attitude imperceptibly changed. \nA healing calm descended at mere sight of my guru. Every day with him \nwas a new experience in joy, peace, and wisdom. Never did I find him \ndeluded or intoxicated with greed or emotion or anger or any human \nattachment.  \n\"The darkness of maya is silently approaching. Let us hie homeward \nwithin.\" With these words at dusk Master constantly reminded his \ndisciples of their need for Kriya Yoga. A new student occasionally \n"}

Human conduct is ever unreliable \nuntil anchored in the Divine. Everything in future will improve if you are \nmaking a spiritual effort now.\"  \nMaster always had young chelas 12-13 in his hermitage. Their spiritual and \nintellectual education was his lifelong interest: even shortly before he \npassed on, he accepted for training two six-year-old boys and one youth \nof sixteen. He directed their minds and lives with that careful discipline \nin which the word \"disciple\" is etymologically rooted. The ashram \nresidents loved and revered their guru; a slight clap of his hands sufficed \nto bring them eagerly to his side. When his mood was silent and \nwithdrawn, no one ventured to speak; when his laugh rang jovially, children \nlooked upon him as their own.  \nMaster seldom asked others to render him a personal service, nor would \nhe accept help from a student unless the willingness were sincere. My \nguru quietly washed his clothes if the disciples overlooked that privileged \ntask. Sri Yukteswar wore the traditional ocher-colored swami robe; his \nlaceless shoes, in accordance with yogi custom, were of tiger or deer skin.  \nMaster spoke fluent English, French, Hindi, and Bengali; his Sanskrit was \nfair. He patiently instructed his young disciples by certain short cuts \nwhich he had ingeniously devised for the study of English and Sanskrit.  \nMaster was cautious of his body, while withholding solicitous attachment. \nThe Infinite, he pointed out, properly manifests through physical and \nmental soundness. He discountenanced any extremes. A disciple once \nstarted a long fast. My guru only laughed: \"Why not throw the dog a \nbone?\"  \nSri Yukteswar's health was excellent; I never saw him unwell. 12-14 He \npermitted students to consult doctors if it seemed advisable. His purpose \nwas to give respect to the worldly custom: \"Physicians must carry on their \nwork of healing through God's laws as applied to matter.\" But he extolled \nthe superiority of mental therapy, and often repeated: \"Wisdom is the \ngreatest cleanser.\"  \n"}

Imagination is the door \nthrough which disease as well as healing enters. Disbelieve in the reality \nof sickness even when you are ill; an unrecognized visitor will flee!\"  \nMaster numbered many doctors among his disciples. \"Those who have \nferreted out the physical laws can easily investigate the science of the \nsoul,\" he told them. \"A subtle spiritual mechanism is hidden just behind \nthe bodily structure.\" 12-15  \nSri Yukteswar counseled his students to be living liaisons of Western and \nEastern virtues. Himself an executive Occidental in outer habits, inwardly \nhe was the spiritual Oriental. He praised the progressive, resourceful and \nhygienic habits of the West, and the religious ideals which give a \ncenturied halo to the East.  \nDiscipline had not been unknown to me: at home Father was strict, Ananta \noften severe. But Sri Yukteswar's training cannot be described as other \nthan drastic. A perfectionist, my guru was hypercritical of his disciples, \nwhether in matters of moment or in the subtle nuances of behavior.  \n\"Good manners without sincerity are like a beautiful dead lady,\" he \nremarked on suitable occasion. \"Straightforwardness without civility is \nlike a surgeon's knife, effective but unpleasant. Candor with courtesy is \nhelpful and admirable.\"  \nMaster was apparently satisfied with my spiritual progress, for he seldom \nreferred to it; in other matters my ears were no strangers to reproof. \nMy chief offenses were absentmindedness, intermittent indulgence in sad \nmoods, non-observance of certain rules of etiquette, and occasional \nunmethodical ways.  \n\"Observe how the activities of your father Bhagabati are well- organized \nand balanced in every way,\" my guru pointed out. The two disciples of \nLahiri Mahasaya had met, soon after I began my pilgrimages to \nSerampore. Father and Sri Yukteswar admiringly evaluated the other's \nworth. Both had built an inner life of spiritual granite, insoluble against \nthe ages.  \nFrom transient teachers of my earlier life I had imbibed a few erroneous \nlessons.

Human nature finds such instruction very easy of \nassimilation. Under Master's unsparing rod, however, I soon recovered \nfrom the agreeable delusions of irresponsibility.  \n\"Those who are too good for this world are adorning some other,\" Sri \nYukteswar remarked. \"So long as you breathe the free air of earth, you \nare under obligation to render grateful service. He alone who has fully \nmastered the breathless state 12-16 is freed from cosmic imperatives. I \nwill not fail to let you know when you have attained the final perfection.\"  \nMy guru could never be bribed, even by love. He showed no leniency to \nanyone who, like myself, willingly offered to be his disciple. Whether \nMaster and I were surrounded by his students or by strangers, or were \nalone together, he always spoke plainly and upbraided sharply. No trifling \nlapse into shallowness or inconsistency escaped his rebuke. This \nflattening treatment was hard to endure, but my resolve was to allow Sri \nYukteswar to iron out each of my psychological kinks. As he labored at \nthis titanic transformation, I shook many times under the weight of his \ndisciplinary hammer.  \n\"If you don't like my words, you are at liberty to leave at any time,\" \nMaster assured me. \"I want nothing from you but your own improvement. \nStay only if you feel benefited.\"  \nFor every humbling blow he dealt my vanity, for every tooth in my \nmetaphorical jaw he knocked loose with stunning aim, I am grateful \nbeyond any facility of expression. The hard core of human egotism is \nhardly to be dislodged except rudely. With its departure, the Divine finds \nat last an unobstructed channel. In vain It seeks to percolate through \nflinty hearts of selfishness.  \nSri Yukteswar's wisdom was so penetrating that, heedless of remarks, he \noften replied to one's unspoken observation. \"What a person imagines he \nhears, and what the speaker has really implied, may be poles apart,\" he \nsaid. \"Try to feel the thoughts behind the confusion of men's verbiage.\"  \nBut divine insight is painful to worldly ears; Master was not popular with \nsuperficial students. The wise, always few in number, deeply revered him. \nI daresay Sri Yukteswar would have been the most sought- after guru in \nIndia had his words not been so candid and so censorious.  \n"}

The gentle \napproach of love is also transfiguring. The inflexible and the yielding \nmethods are equally effective if applied with wisdom. You will go to \nforeign lands, where blunt assaults on the ego are not appreciated. A \nteacher could not spread India's message in the West without an ample \nfund of accommodative patience and forbearance.\" I refuse to state the \namount of truth I later came to find in Master's words!  \nThough Sri Yukteswar's undissembling speech prevented a large following \nduring his years on earth, nevertheless his living spirit manifests today \nover the world, through sincere students of his Kriya Yoga and other \nteachings. He has further dominion in men's souls than ever Alexander \ndreamed of in the soil.  \nFather arrived one day to pay his respects to Sri Yukteswar. My parent \nexpected, very likely, to hear some words in my praise. He was shocked to \nbe given a long account of my imperfections. It was Master's practice to \nrecount simple, negligible shortcomings with an air of portentous gravity. \nFather rushed to see me. \"From your guru's remarks I thought to find \nyou a complete wreck!\" My parent was between tears and laughter.  \nThe only cause of Sri Yukteswar's displeasure at the time was that I had \nbeen trying, against his gentle hint, to convert a certain man to the \nspiritual path.  \nWith indignant speed I sought out my guru. He received me with \ndowncast eyes, as though conscious of guilt. It was the only time I ever \nsaw the divine lion meek before me. The unique moment was savored to \nthe full.  \n\"Sir, why did you judge me so mercilessly before my astounded father? \nWas that just?\"  \n\"I will not do it again.\" Master's tone was apologetic.  \nInstantly I was disarmed.

Such \nstudents often complained that they did not understand Sri Yukteswar.  \n\"Neither do you comprehend God!\" I retorted on one occasion. \"When a \nsaint is clear to you, you will be one.\" Among the trillion mysteries, \nbreathing every second the inexplicable air, who may venture to ask that \nthe fathomless nature of a master be instantly grasped?  \nStudents came, and generally went. Those who craved a path of oily \nsympathy and comfortable recognitions did not find it at the hermitage. \nMaster offered shelter and shepherding for the aeons, but many \ndisciples miserly demanded ego-balm as well. They departed, preferring \nlife's countless humiliations before any humility. Master's blazing rays, \nthe open penetrating sunshine of his wisdom, were too powerful for their \nspiritual sickness. They sought some lesser teacher who, shading them \nwith flattery, permitted the fitful sleep of ignorance.  \nDuring my early months with Master, I had experienced a sensitive fear \nof his reprimands. These were reserved, I soon saw, for disciples who had \nasked for his verbal vivisection. If any writhing student made a protest, \nSri Yukteswar would become unoffendedly silent. His words were never \nwrathful, but impersonal with wisdom.  \nMaster's insight was not for the unprepared ears of casual visitors; he \nseldom remarked on their defects, even if conspicuous. But toward \nstudents who sought his counsel, Sri Yukteswar felt a serious \nresponsibility. Brave indeed is the guru who undertakes to transform the \ncrude ore of ego-permeated humanity! A saint's courage roots in his \ncompassion for the stumbling eyeless of this world.  \nWhen I had abandoned underlying resentment, I found a marked \ndecrease in my chastisement.

In time I demolished every wall of rationalization \nand subconscious reservation behind which the human personality \ngenerally shields itself. 12-17 The reward was an effortless harmony with \nmy guru. I discovered him then to be trusting, considerate, and silently \nloving. Undemonstrative, however, he bestowed no word of affection.  \nMy own temperament is principally devotional. It was disconcerting at \nfirst to find that my guru, saturated with jnana but seemingly dry of \nbhakti, 12-18 expressed himself only in terms of cold spiritual mathematics. \nBut as I tuned myself to his nature, I discovered no diminution but rather \nincrease in my devotional approach to God. A self-realized master is fully \nable to guide his various disciples along natural lines of their essential \nbias.  \nMy relationship with Sri Yukteswar, somewhat inarticulate, nonetheless \npossessed all eloquence. Often I found his silent signature on my \nthoughts, rendering speech inutile. Quietly sitting beside him, I felt his \nbounty pouring peacefully over my being.  \nSri Yukteswar's impartial justice was notably demonstrated during the \nsummer vacation of my first college year. I welcomed the opportunity to \nspend uninterrupted months at Serampore with my guru.  \n\"You may be in charge of the hermitage.\" Master was pleased over my \nenthusiastic arrival. \"Your duties will be the reception of guests, and \nsupervision of the work of the other disciples.\"  \nKumar, a young villager from east Bengal, was accepted a fortnight later \nfor hermitage training. Remarkably intelligent, he quickly won Sri \nYukteswar's affection. For some unfathomable reason, Master was very \nlenient to the new resident.  \n\"Mukunda, let Kumar assume your duties. Employ your own time in \nsweeping and cooking.\" Master issued these instructions after the new \nboy had been with us for a month.  \nExalted to leadership, Kumar exercised a petty household tyranny. In \nsilent mutiny, the other disciples continued to seek me out for daily \ncounsel.  \n\"Mukunda is impossible!

You wanted Mukunda's position, but could not maintain it by \nmerit. Return now to your earlier work as cook's assistant.\"  \nAfter this humbling incident, Master resumed toward Kumar a former \nattitude of unwonted indulgence. Who can solve the mystery of \nattraction? In Kumar our guru discovered a charming fount which did not \nspurt for the fellow disciples. Though the new boy was obviously Sri \nYukteswar's favorite, I felt no dismay. Personal idiosyncrasies, possessed \neven by masters, lend a rich complexity to the pattern of life. My nature \nis seldom commandeered by a detail; I was seeking from Sri Yukteswar a \nmore inaccessible benefit than an outward praise.  \nKumar spoke venomously to me one day without reason; I was deeply hurt.  \n\"Your head is swelling to the bursting point!\" I added a warning whose \ntruth I felt intuitively: \"Unless you mend your ways, someday you will be \nasked to leave this ashram.\"  \nLaughing sarcastically, Kumar repeated my remark to our guru, who had \njust entered the room. Fully expecting to be scolded, I retired meekly to \na corner.  \n\"Maybe Mukunda is right.\" Master's reply to the boy came with unusual \ncoldness. I escaped without castigation.  \nA year later, Kumar set out for a visit to his childhood home. He ignored \nthe quiet disapproval of Sri Yukteswar, who never authoritatively \ncontrolled his disciples' movements. On the boy's return to Serampore in \na few months, a change was unpleasantly apparent. Gone was the stately \nKumar with serenely glowing face. Only an undistinguished peasant stood \nbefore us, one who had lately acquired a number of evil habits.  \nMaster summoned me and brokenheartedly discussed the fact that the \nboy was now unsuited to the monastic hermitage life.  \n\"Mukunda, I will leave it to you to instruct Kumar to leave the ashram \ntomorrow; I can't do it!\" Tears stood in Sri Yukteswar's eyes, but he \ncontrolled himself quickly. \"The boy would never have fallen to these \ndepths had he listened to me and not gone away to mix with undesirable \n"}

Sense wiles are \ncomparable to the evergreen oleander, fragrant with its multicolored \nflowers: every part of the plant is poisonous. The land of healing lies \nwithin, radiant with that happiness blindly sought in a thousand \nmisdirections. 12-19  \n\"Keen intelligence is two-edged,\" Master once remarked in reference to \nKumar's brilliant mind. \"It may be used constructively or destructively \nlike a knife, either to cut the boil of ignorance, or to decapitate one's \nself. Intelligence is rightly guided only after the mind has acknowledged \nthe inescapability of spiritual law.\"  \nMy guru mixed freely with men and women disciples, treating all as his \nchildren. Perceiving their soul equality, he showed no distinction or \npartiality.  \n\"In sleep, you do not know whether you are a man or a woman,\" he said. \n\"Just as a man, impersonating a woman, does not become one, so the soul, \nimpersonating both man and woman, has no sex. The soul is the pure, \nchangeless image of God.\"  \nSri Yukteswar never avoided or blamed women as objects of seduction. \nMen, he said, were also a temptation to women. I once inquired of my guru \nwhy a great ancient saint had called women \"the door to hell.\"  \n\"A girl must have proved very troublesome to his peace of mind in his \nearly life,\" my guru answered causticly. \"Otherwise he would have \ndenounced, not woman, but some imperfection in his own self-control.\"  \nIf a visitor dared to relate a suggestive story in the hermitage, Master \nwould maintain an unresponsive silence. \"Do not allow yourself to be \nthrashed by the provoking whip of a beautiful face,\" he told the disciples. \n\"How can sense slaves enjoy the world? Its subtle flavors escape them \nwhile they grovel in primal mud. All nice discriminations are lost to the \nman of elemental lusts.\"  \n"}

She saw him only as her little boy, not as a sage. \nThere was a charm about the trifling incident; it supplied a sidelight on \nmy guru's unusual nature, inwardly humble and outwardly unbendable.  \nThe monastic regulations do not allow a swami to retain connection with \nworldly ties after their formal severance.

His calm gaze was unfathomable. \"Your heart's \ndesire shall be fulfilled.\"  \nSri Yukteswar seldom indulged in riddles; I was bewildered. He struck \ngently on my chest above the heart.  \nMy body became immovably rooted; breath was drawn out of my lungs as \nif by some huge magnet. Soul and mind instantly lost their physical \nbondage, and streamed out like a fluid piercing light from my every pore. \nThe flesh was as though dead, yet in my intense awareness I knew that \nnever before had I been fully alive. My sense of identity was no longer \nnarrowly confined to a body, but embraced the circumambient atoms. \nPeople on distant streets seemed to be moving gently over my own remote \nperiphery. The roots of plants and trees appeared through a dim \ntransparency of the soil; I discerned the inward flow of their sap.  \nThe whole vicinity lay bare before me. My ordinary frontal vision was now \nchanged to a vast spherical sight, simultaneously all-perceptive.

My body, Master's, the pillared courtyard, the furniture \nand floor, the trees and sunshine, occasionally became violently agitated, \nuntil all melted into a luminescent sea; even as sugar crystals, thrown into \na glass of water, dissolve after being shaken. The unifying light \nalternated with materializations of form, the metamorphoses revealing \nthe law of cause and effect in creation.  \nAn oceanic joy broke upon calm endless shores of my soul.

Again and again I saw the \ncreative beams condense into constellations, then resolve into sheets of \ntransparent flame. By rhythmic reversion, sextillion worlds passed into \ndiaphanous luster; fire became firmament.  \nI cognized the center of the empyrean as a point of intuitive perception \nin my heart.

The creative voice of God I \nheard resounding as Aum , 14-1 the vibration of the Cosmic Motor.  \nSuddenly the breath returned to my lungs. With a disappointment almost \nunbearable, I realized that my infinite immensity was lost. Once more I \nwas limited to the humiliating cage of a body, not easily accommodative to \nthe Spirit. Like a prodigal child, I had run away from my macrocosmic \nhome and imprisoned myself in a narrow microcosm.  \nMy guru was standing motionless before me; I started to drop at his holy \nfeet in gratitude for the experience in cosmic consciousness which I had \nlong passionately sought.

The soul must stretch over the cosmogonic abysses, while \nthe body performs its daily duties. When we set out later for a stroll, I \nwas still entranced in unspeakable rapture. I saw our bodies as two astral \npictures, moving over a road by the river whose essence was sheer light.  \n\"It is the Spirit of God that actively sustains every form and force in the \nuniverse; yet He is transcendental and aloof in the blissful uncreated void \nbeyond the worlds of vibratory phenomena,\" 14-2 Master explained. \"Saints \n"}

By daily stilling my \nthoughts, I could win release from the delusive conviction that my body \nwas a mass of flesh and bones, traversing the hard soil of matter.

Almost paralyzed with curiosity, I \nglued my eyes on the hilarious spectacle. As the man reached a point in \nthe road where he would vanish from our view, Sri Yukteswar said, \"Now, \nhe will return.\"  \nThe peasant at once changed his direction and made for the rear of the \nashram.

Sri Yukteswar was a perfect human radio. Thoughts are no more \nthan very gentle vibrations moving in the ether. Just as a sensitized radio \npicks up a desired musical number out of thousands of other programs \nfrom every direction, so my guru had been able to catch the thought of \nthe half-witted man who hankered for a cauliflower, out of the countless \nthoughts of broadcasting human wills in the world. 15-2 By his powerful \nwill, Master was also a human broadcasting station, and had successfully \ndirected the peasant to reverse his steps and go to a certain room for a \nsingle cauliflower.  \nIntuition 15-3 is soul guidance, appearing naturally in man during those \ninstants when his mind is calm. Nearly everyone has had the experience of \nan inexplicably correct \"hunch,\" or has transferred his thoughts \neffectively to another person.  \nThe human mind, free from the static of restlessness, can perform \nthrough its antenna of intuition all the functions of complicated radio \nmechanisms-sending and receiving thoughts, and tuning out undesirable \nones. As the power of a radio depends on the amount of electrical current \nit can utilize, so the human radio is energized according to the power of \nwill possessed by each individual.  \nAll thoughts vibrate eternally in the cosmos. By deep concentration, a \nmaster is able to detect the thoughts of any mind, living or dead. \nThoughts are universally and not individually rooted; a truth cannot be \ncreated, but only perceived. The erroneous thoughts of man result from \nimperfections in his discernment. The goal of yoga science is to calm the \nmind, that without distortion it may mirror the divine vision in the \nuniverse.  \nRadio and television have brought the instantaneous sound and sight of \nremote persons to the firesides of millions: the first faint scientific \nintimations that man is an all-pervading spirit. Not a body confined to a \npoint in space, but the vast soul, which the ego in most barbaric modes \nconspires in vain to cramp.  \n\"Very strange, very wonderful, seemingly very improbable phenomena may \nyet appear which, when once established, will not astonish us more than \nwe are now astonished at all that science has taught us during the last \ncentury,\" Charles Robert Richet, Nobel Prizeman in physiology, has \ndeclared. \"It is assumed that the phenomena which we now accept \n"}

The science \nof today is a light matter; the revolutions and evolutions which it will \nexperience in a hundred thousand years will far exceed the most daring \nanticipations.

The \nmelody was heard again, this time correctly rendered.  \nIn India, music as well as painting and the drama is considered a divine \nart. Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva-the Eternal Trinity-were the first \nmusicians. The Divine Dancer Shiva is scripturally represented as having \nworked out the infinite modes of rhythm in His cosmic dance of universal \ncreation, preservation, and dissolution, while Brahma accentuated the \ntime-beat with the clanging cymbals, and Vishnu sounded the holy \nmridanga or drum.

The Sama Veda of India contains the \nworld's earliest writings on musical science.  \nThe foundation stone of Hindu music is the ragas or fixed melodic scales. \nThe six basic ragas branch out into 126 derivative raginis (wives) and \nputras (sons). Each raga has a minimum of five notes: a leading note (vadi \nor king), a secondary note (samavadi or prime minister), helping notes \n(anuvadi , attendants), and a dissonant note (vivadi , the enemy).  \nEach one of the six basic ragas has a natural correspondence with a \ncertain hour of the day, season of the year, and a presiding deity who \nbestows a particular potency. Thus, (1) the Hindole Raga is heard only at \ndawn in the spring, to evoke the mood of universal love; (2) Deepaka Raga \nis played during the evening in summer, to arouse compassion; (3) Megha \nRaga is a melody for midday in the rainy season, to summon courage; (4) \nBhairava Raga is played in the mornings of August, September, October, \n"}

Each one \nof the seven basic notes of the octave is associated in Hindu mythology \nwith a color, and the natural cry of a bird or beast-Do with green, and the \npeacock; Re with red, and the skylark; Mi with golden, and the goat; Fa \nwith yellowish white, and the heron; Sol with black, and the nightingale; \nLa with yellow, and the horse; Si with a combination of all colors, and the \nelephant.  \nThree scales-major, harmonic minor, melodic minor-are the only ones \nwhich Occidental music employs, but Indian music outlines 72 thatas or \nscales. The musician has a creative scope for endless improvisation around \nthe fixed traditional melody or raga ; he concentrates on the sentiment \nor definitive mood of the structural theme and then embroiders it to the \nlimits of his own originality. The Hindu musician does not read set notes; \nhe clothes anew at each playing the bare skeleton of the raga , often \nconfining himself to a single melodic sequence, stressing by repetition all \nits subtle microtonal and rhythmic variations. Bach, among Western \ncomposers, had an understanding of the charm and power of repetitious \nsound slightly differentiated in a hundred complex ways.  \nAncient Sanskrit literature describes 120 talas or time-measures. The \ntraditional founder of Hindu music, Bharata, is said to have isolated 32 \nkinds of tala in the song of a lark. The origin of tala or rhythm is rooted \nin human movements-the double time of walking, and the triple time of \nrespiration in sleep, when inhalation is twice the length of exhalation. \nIndia has always recognized the human voice as the most perfect \n"}

To these, for advantageous upward evolution, He transferred the \nsouls or divine essence of two animals. 16-17 In Adam or man, reason \npredominated; in Eve or woman, feeling was ascendant. Thus was \nexpressed the duality or polarity which underlies the phenomenal worlds. \nReason and feeling remain in a heaven of cooperative joy so long as the \nhuman mind is not tricked by the serpentine energy of animal \npropensities.  \n\"The human body was therefore not solely a result of evolution from \nbeasts, but was produced by an act of special creation by God.

The all-creative powers of his will, focused at that spot, were \nlost to man when he began to \"till the ground\" of his physical nature.  \nCHAPTER: 17 \nSasi And The Three Sapphires \n\"Because you and my son think so highly of Swami Sri Yukteswar, I will \ntake a look at him.\" The tone of voice used by Dr. Narayan Chunder Roy \nimplied that he was humoring the whim of half-wits. I concealed my \nindignation, in the best traditions of the proselyter.  \nMy companion, a veterinary surgeon, was a confirmed agnostic. His young \nson Santosh had implored me to take an interest in his father. So far my \ninvaluable aid had been a bit on the invisible side.  \nDr. Roy accompanied me the following day to the Serampore hermitage. \nAfter Master had granted him a brief interview, marked for the most \npart by stoic silence on both sides, the visitor brusquely departed.  \n\"Why bring a dead man to the ashram?\" Sri Yukteswar looked at me \ninquiringly as soon as the door had closed on the Calcutta skeptic.  \n\"Sir! The doctor is very much alive!\"  \n\"But in a short time he will be dead.\"  \nI was shocked. \"Sir, this will be a terrible blow to his son. Santosh yet \nhopes for time to change his father's materialistic views. I beseech you, \nMaster, to help the man.\"  \n\"Very well; for your sake.\" My guru's face was impassive. \"The proud \nhorse doctor is far gone in diabetes, although he does not know it. In \nfifteen days he will take to his bed. The physicians will give him up for \nlost; his natural time to leave this earth is six weeks from today. Due to \nyour intercession, however, on that date he will recover. But there is one \ncondition. You must get him to wear an astrological bangle; he will \ndoubtless object as violently as one of his horses before an operation!\" \nMaster chuckled.  \n"}

He will not \nheed this counsel, however, and in six months, just as he is feeling at his \nbest, he will drop dead. Even that six-month extension of life is granted \nhim only because of your plea.\"  \nThe following day I suggested to Santosh that he order an armlet at the \njeweler's. It was ready in a week, but Dr. Roy refused to put it on.  \n\"I am in the best of health. You will never impress me with these \nastrological superstitions.\" The doctor glanced at me belligerently.  \nI recalled with amusement that Master had justifiably compared the man \nto a balky horse. Another seven days passed; the doctor, suddenly ill, \nmeekly consented to wear the bangle. Two weeks later the physician in \nattendance told me that his patient's case was hopeless. He supplied \nharrowing details of the ravages inflicted by diabetes.  \nI shook my head. \"My guru has said that, after a sickness lasting one \nmonth, Dr. Roy will be well.\"  \nThe physician stared at me incredulously. But he sought me out a \nfortnight later, with an apologetic air.  \n\"Dr. Roy has made a complete recovery!\" he exclaimed. \"It is the most \namazing case in my experience. Never before have I seen a dying man \nshow such an inexplicable comeback. Your guru must indeed be a healing \nprophet!\"  \nAfter one interview with Dr. Roy, during which I repeated Sri \nYukteswar's advice about a meatless diet, I did not see the man again for \nsix months. He stopped for a chat one evening as I sat on the piazza of \nmy family home on Gurpar Road.  \n\"Tell your teacher that by eating meat frequently, I have wholly regained \nmy strength. His unscientific ideas on diet have not influenced me.\" It \nwas true that Dr. Roy looked a picture of health.  \nBut the next day Santosh came running to me from his home on the next \nblock. \"This morning Father dropped dead!\"  \n"}

He healed \nthe rebellious veterinary surgeon in spite of his disbelief, and extended \nthe man's natural term on earth by six months, just because of my \nearnest supplication. Sri Yukteswar was boundless in his kindness when \nconfronted by the urgent prayer of a devotee.  \nIt was my proudest privilege to bring college friends to meet my guru. \nMany of them would lay aside-at least in the ashram!-their fashionable \nacademic cloak of religious skepticism.  \nOne of my friends, Sasi, spent a number of happy week ends in \nSerampore. Master became immensely fond of the boy, and lamented that \nhis private life was wild and disorderly.  \n\"Sasi, unless you reform, one year hence you will be dangerously ill.\" Sri \nYukteswar gazed at my friend with affectionate exasperation. \"Mukunda \nis the witness: don't say later that I didn't warn you.\"  \nSasi laughed. \"Master, I will leave it to you to interest a sweet charity of \ncosmos in my own sad case! My spirit is willing but my will is weak. You are \nmy only savior on earth; I believe in nothing else.\"  \n\"At least you should wear a two-carat blue sapphire. It will help you.\"  \n\"I can't afford one. Anyhow, dear guruji, if trouble comes, I fully believe \nyou will protect me.\"  \n\"In a year you will bring three sapphires,\" Sri Yukteswar replied \ncryptically. \"They will be of no use then.\"  \nVariations on this conversation took place regularly. \"I can't reform!\" \nSasi would say in comical despair. \"And my trust in you, Master, is more \nprecious to me than any stone!\"  \nA year later I was visiting my guru at the Calcutta home of his disciple, \nNaren Babu. About ten o'clock in the morning, as Sri Yukteswar and I \nwere sitting quietly in the second-floor parlor, I heard the front door \nopen. Master straightened stiffly.  \n\"It is that Sasi,\" he remarked gravely. \"The year is now up; both his lungs \nare gone. He has ignored my counsel; tell him I don't want to see him.\"  \n"}

I do hope Master is here; I had a hunch he might be.\"  \n\"Yes, but he doesn't wish to be disturbed.\"  \nSasi burst into tears and brushed past me. He threw himself at Sri \nYukteswar's feet, placing there three beautiful sapphires.  \n\"Omniscient guru, the doctors say I have galloping tuberculosis! They give \nme no longer than three more months! I humbly implore your aid; I know \nyou can heal me!\"  \n\"Isn't it a bit late now to be worrying over your life? Depart with your \njewels; their time of usefulness is past.\" Master then sat sphinxlike in an \nunrelenting silence, punctuated by the boy's sobs for mercy.  \nAn intuitive conviction came to me that Sri Yukteswar was merely testing \nthe depth of Sasi's faith in the divine healing power. I was not surprised \na tense hour later when Master turned a sympathetic gaze on my \nprostrate friend.  \n\"Get up, Sasi; what a commotion you make in other people's houses! \nReturn your sapphires to the jeweler's; they are an unnecessary expense \nnow. But get an astrological bangle and wear it. Fear not; in a few weeks \nyou shall be well.\"  \nSasi's smile illumined his tear-marred face like sudden sun over a sodden \nlandscape. \"Beloved guru, shall I take the medicines prescribed by the \ndoctors?\"  \nSri Yukteswar's glance was longanimous. \"Just as you wish-drink them or \ndiscard them; it does not matter. It is more possible for the sun and \nmoon to interchange their positions than for you to die of tuberculosis.\" \nHe added abruptly, \"Go now, before I change my mind!\"  \nWith an agitated bow, my friend hastily departed. I visited him several \ntimes during the next few weeks, and was aghast to find his condition \nincreasingly worse.  \n"}

My guru listened coldly to my tearful report.  \n\"Why do you come here to bother me? You have already heard me assure \nSasi of his recovery.\"  \nI bowed before him in great awe, and retreated to the door. Sri \nYukteswar said no parting word, but sank into silence, his unwinking eyes \nhalf-open, their vision fled to another world.  \nI returned at once to Sasi's home in Calcutta. With astonishment I found \nmy friend sitting up, drinking milk.  \n\"O Mukunda! What a miracle! Four hours ago I felt Master's presence in \nthe room; my terrible symptoms immediately disappeared. I feel that \nthrough his grace I am entirely well.\"  \nIn a few weeks Sasi was stouter and in better health than ever before. 17-\n1 But his singular reaction to his healing had an ungrateful tinge: he \nseldom visited Sri Yukteswar again! My friend told me one day that he so \ndeeply regretted his previous mode of life that he was ashamed to face \nMaster.  \nI could only conclude that Sasi's illness had had the contrasting effect of \nstiffening his will and impairing his manners.  \nThe first two years of my course at Scottish Church College were \ndrawing to a close. My classroom attendance had been very spasmodic; \nwhat little studying I did was only to keep peace with my family. My two \nprivate tutors came regularly to my house; I was regularly absent: I can \ndiscern at least this one regularity in my scholastic career!  \nIn India two successful years of college bring an Intermediate Arts \ndiploma; the student may then look forward to another two years and his \nA.B. degree.  \nThe Intermediate Arts final examinations loomed ominously ahead. I fled \nto Puri, where my guru was spending a few weeks. Vaguely hoping that he \nwould sanction my nonappearance at the finals, I related my embarrassing \nunpreparedness.  \n"}

Surveying the mountain of \nbooks on my table, I felt like a traveler lost in a wilderness. A long period \nof meditation brought me a labor-saving inspiration. Opening each book at \nrandom, I studied only those pages which lay thus exposed. Pursuing this \ncourse during eighteen hours a day for a week, I considered myself \nentitled to advise all succeeding generations on the art of cramming.  \nThe following days in the examination halls were a justification of my \nseemingly haphazard procedure. I passed all the tests, though by a \nhairbreadth. The congratulations of my friends and family were \nludicrously mixed with ejaculations betraying their astonishment.  \nOn his return from Puri, Sri Yukteswar gave me a pleasant surprise. \"Your \nCalcutta studies are now over. I will see that you pursue your last two \nyears of university work right here in Serampore.\"  \nI was puzzled. \"Sir, there is no Bachelor of Arts course in this town.\" \nSerampore College, the sole institution of higher learning, offered only a \ntwo-year course in Intermediate Arts.  \nMaster smiled mischievously. \"I am too old to go about collecting \ndonations to establish an A.B. college for you. I guess I shall have to \narrange the matter through someone else.\"  \nTwo months later Professor Howells, president of Serampore College, \npublicly announced that he had succeeded in raising sufficient funds to \noffer a four-year course. Serampore College became a branch affiliation \nof the University of Calcutta. I was one of the first students to enroll in \nSerampore as an A.B. candidate.  \n\"Guruji, how kind you are to me! I have been longing to leave Calcutta and \nbe near you every day in Serampore.

It was an old- fashioned \nbrick mansion, fronting the Ganges.  \n\"Master, what a coincidence!

'I am \ngoing to teach you a certain yoga method which will give you command \nover one of the invisible realms.

His \nmiraculous feats began to attract widespread attention. It seems that he \nwas always accompanied by a disembodied spirit whom he called 'Hazrat.' \nThis invisible entity was able to fulfill the FAKIR'S slightest wish.  \n\"Ignoring his master's warning, Afzal began to misuse his powers. \nWhatever object he touched and then replaced would soon disappear \nwithout a trace. This disconcerting eventuality usually made the \nMohammedan an objectionable guest!  \n\"He visited large jewelry stores in Calcutta from time to time, \nrepresenting himself as a possible purchaser. Any jewel he handled would \nvanish shortly after he had left the shop.  \n\"Afzal was often surrounded by several hundred students, attracted by \nthe hope of learning his secrets.

These he would return to the clerk, remarking: 'I have changed \nmy mind, and won't buy them now.' But when he boarded the train with \nhis retinue, Afzal would be in possession of the required tickets. 18-2  \n\"These exploits created an indignant uproar; Bengali jewelers and ticket-\nsellers were succumbing to nervous breakdowns! The police who sought to \narrest Afzal found themselves helpless; the fakir could remove \nincriminating evidence merely by saying: 'Hazrat, take this away.'\"  \nSri Yukteswar rose from his seat and walked to the balcony of my room \nwhich overlooked the Ganges. I followed him, eager to hear more of the \nbaffling Mohammedan Raffles.  \n\"This Panthi house formerly belonged to a friend of mine. He became \nacquainted with Afzal and asked him here.

Through the agency \nof an astral being, Hazrat, the Mohammedan could summon the atoms of \nany object from etheric energy by an act of powerful will. But such \nastrally-produced objects are structurally evanescent; they cannot be \nlong retained. Afzal still yearned for worldly wealth which, though more \nhardly earned, has a more dependable durability.\"  \nI laughed. \"It too sometimes vanishes most unaccountably!\"  \n\"Afzal was not a man of God-realization,\" Master went on. \"Miracles of a \npermanent and beneficial nature are performed by true saints because \nthey have attuned themselves to the omnipotent Creator.

From it I learned the facts I have just \ntold you about Afzal's early initiation from a Hindu guru.\"  \nThe gist of the latter part of the published document, as recalled by Sri \nYukteswar, was as follows: \"I, Afzal Khan, am writing these words as an \nact of penance and as a warning to those who seek the possession of \nmiraculous powers. For years I have been misusing the wondrous abilities \nimparted to me through the grace of God and my master. I became drunk \nwith egotism, feeling that I was beyond the ordinary laws of morality. My \nday of reckoning finally arrived.  \n\"Recently I met an old man on a road outside Calcutta. He limped along \npainfully, carrying a shining object which looked like gold. I addressed him \nwith greed in my heart.  \n\"'I am Afzal Khan, the great fakir . What have you there?'  \n\"'This ball of gold is my sole material wealth; it can be of no interest to a \nfakir . I implore you, sir, to heal my limp.'  \n\"I touched the ball and walked away without reply. The old man hobbled \nafter me. He soon raised an outcry: 'My gold is gone!'  \n\"As I paid no attention, he suddenly spoke in a stentorian voice that \nissued oddly from his frail body:  \n\"'Do you not recognize me?'  \n\"I stood speechless, aghast at the belated discovery that this \nunimpressive old cripple was none other than the great saint who, long, \nlong ago, had initiated me into yoga. He straightened himself; his body \ninstantly became strong and youthful.  \n\"'So!' My guru's glance was fiery. 'I see with my own eyes that you use \nyour powers, not to help suffering humanity, but to prey on it like a \ncommon thief! I withdraw your occult gifts; Hazrat is now freed from \nyou. No longer shall you be a terror in Bengal!'  \n"}

In Master's \npresence my friend received such spiritual peace that he was soon a \nconstant visitor. The trivial preoccupations of daily life are not enough \nfor man; wisdom too is a native hunger. In Sri Yukteswar's words Dijen \nfound an incentive to those attempts-first painful, then effortlessly \nliberating-to locate a realer self within his bosom than the humiliating ego \nof a temporary birth, seldom ample enough for the Spirit.  \nAs Dijen and I were both pursuing the A.B. course at Serampore College, \nwe got into the habit of walking together to the ashram as soon as \nclasses were over. We would often see Sri Yukteswar standing on his \nsecond-floor balcony, welcoming our approach with a smile.  \nOne afternoon Kanai, a young hermitage resident, met Dijen and me at \nthe door with disappointing news.  \n\"Master is not here; he was summoned to Calcutta by an urgent note.\"  \nThe following day I received a post card from my guru. \"I shall leave \nCalcutta Wednesday morning,\" he had written. \"You and Dijen meet the \nnine o'clock train at Serampore station.\"  \nAbout eight-thirty on Wednesday morning, a telepathic message from Sri \nYukteswar flashed insistently to my mind: \"I am delayed; don't meet the \nnine o'clock train.\"  \nI conveyed the latest instructions to Dijen, who was already dressed for \ndeparture.  \n\"You and your intuition!\" My friend's voice was edged in scorn. \"I prefer \nto trust Master's written word.\"  \nI shrugged my shoulders and seated myself with quiet finality. Muttering \nangrily, Dijen made for the door and closed it noisily behind him.  \nAs the room was rather dark, I moved nearer to the window overlooking \nthe street. The scant sunlight suddenly increased to an intense brilliancy \nin which the iron-barred window completely vanished.

Too much \nastounded to utter a word, I stood up and gazed at him questioningly.  \n\"I was pleased that you got my telepathic message.\" Master's voice was \ncalm, entirely normal. \"I have now finished my business in Calcutta, and \nshall arrive in Serampore by the ten o'clock train.\"  \nAs I still stared mutely, Sri Yukteswar went on, \"This is not an apparition, \nbut my flesh and blood form.

A crestfallen Dijen soon entered the \nroom.  \n\"Master was not on the nine o'clock train, nor even the nine-thirty.\" My \nfriend made his announcement with a slightly apologetic air.  \n\"Come then; I know he will arrive at ten o'clock.\" I took Dijen's hand and \nrushed him forcibly along with me, heedless of his protests.

As I \nwalked along briskly, I met my guru in front of the Christian church near \nSerampore Courthouse.  \n\"Where are you going?\" Sri Yukteswar's face was unsmiling.  \n\"Sir, I hear that you and Kanai will not take the trip we have been \nplanning.

Passing the Christian \nchurch, again I saw my guru walking slowly toward me. Without waiting to \nhear my report, he exclaimed:  \n\"So Behari would not go! Now, what are your plans?\"  \nI felt like a recalcitrant child who is determined to defy his masterful \nfather. \"Sir, I am going to ask my uncle to lend me his servant, Lal Dhari.\"  \n\"See your uncle if you want to,\" Sri Yukteswar replied with a chuckle. \n\"But I hardly think you will enjoy the visit.\"  \n"}

Is there anything I can do to make your \njourney more comfortable?\"  \nThese kind words gave me a lift of encouragement. \"Dear uncle,\" I said, \n\"could you possibly spare me your servant, Lal Dhari?\"  \nMy simple request had the effect of an earthquake. Uncle jumped so \nviolently that his chair overturned, the papers on the desk flew in every \ndirection, and his pipe, a long, coconut-stemmed hubble-bubble, fell to the \nfloor with a great clatter.  \n\"You selfish young man,\" he shouted, quivering with wrath, \"what a \npreposterous idea!

Our first leisurely \nstop was at Simla, a queenly city resting on the throne of Himalayan hills. \nWe strolled over the steep streets, admiring the magnificent views.  \n\"English strawberries for sale,\" cried an old woman, squatting in a \npicturesque open market place.  \nMaster was curious about the strange little red fruits. He bought a \nbasketful and offered it to Kanai and myself, who were near-by. I tasted \none berry but spat it hastily on the ground.  \n\"Sir, what a sour fruit! I could never like strawberries!\"  \nMy guru laughed. \"Oh, you will like them-in America. At a dinner there, \nyour hostess will serve them with sugar and cream. After she has mashed \nthe berries with a fork, you will taste them and say: 'What delicious \nstrawberries!'

I was a dinner \nguest at the home of Mrs. Alice T. Hasey (Sister Yogmata) in West \nSomerville, Massachusetts. When a dessert of strawberries was put on \nthe table, my hostess picked up her fork and mashed my berries, adding \ncream and sugar. \"The fruit is rather tart; I think you will like it fixed \nthis way,\" she remarked.  \nI took a mouthful. \"What delicious strawberries!\" I exclaimed. At once \nmy guru's prediction in Simla emerged from the fathomless cave of \nmemory. It was staggering to realize that long ago Sri Yukteswar's God-\ntuned mind had sensitively detected the program of karmic events \nwandering in the ether of futurity.  \nOur party soon left Simla and entrained for Rawalpindi. There we hired a \nlarge landau, drawn by two horses, in which we started a seven-day trip to \nSrinagar, capital city of Kashmir.

The stream also enters several of the \npalace rooms, ultimately dropping fairy like into the lake below. The \nimmense gardens are riotous with color- roses of a dozen hues, \nsnapdragons, lavender, pansies, poppies. An emerald enclosing outline is \ngiven by symmetrical rows of chinars , 21-2 cypresses, cherry trees; \nbeyond them tower the white austerities of the Himalayas.  \nKashmir grapes are considered a rare delicacy in Calcutta. Rajendra, who \nhad been promising himself a veritable feast on reaching Kashmir, was \ndisappointed to find there no large vineyards.

We consoled \nourselves with ice cream made of rabri , a heavily condensed milk, and \nflavored with whole pistachio nuts.  \nWe took several trips in the shikaras or houseboats, shaded by red- \nembroidered canopies, coursing along the intricate channels of Dal Lake, a \nnetwork of canals like a watery spider web.

These two places stand out in my \nmemory as the loveliest spots on earth.  \nYet I was awed also when I first beheld the wonders of Yellowstone \nNational Park and of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, and of Alaska. \nYellowstone Park is perhaps the only region where one can see \ninnumerable geysers shooting high into the air, performing year after \nyear with clockwork regularity.

Reluctantly I left him.  \n\"Master dangerously ill.\" This telegram from Auddy reached me shortly \nafter my return to Serampore.  \n\"Sir,\" I wired my guru frantically, \"I asked for your promise not to leave \nme. Please keep your body; otherwise, I also shall die.\"  \n\"Be it as you wish.\" This was Sri Yukteswar's reply from Kashmir.  \nA letter from Auddy arrived in a few days, informing me that Master had \nrecovered. On his return to Serampore during the next fortnight, I was \ngrieved to find my guru's body reduced to half its usual weight.  \nFortunately for his disciples, Sri Yukteswar burned many of their sins in \nthe fire of his severe fever in Kashmir. The metaphysical method of \nphysical transfer of disease is known to highly advanced yogis. A strong \nman can assist a weaker one by helping to carry his heavy load; a spiritual \nsuperman is able to minimize his disciples' physical or mental burdens by \nsharing the karma of their past actions. Just as a rich man loses some \nmoney when he pays off a large debt for his prodigal son, who is thus \nsaved from dire consequences of his own folly, so a master willingly \nsacrifices a portion of his bodily wealth to lighten the misery of disciples. \n21-3  \nBy a secret method, the yogi unites his mind and astral vehicle with those \nof a suffering individual; the disease is conveyed, wholly or in part, to the \nsaint's body. Having harvested God on the physical field, a master no \nlonger cares what happens to that material form. Though he may allow it \nto register a certain disease in order to relieve others, his mind is never \naffected; he considers himself fortunate in being able to render such aid.  \nThe devotee who has achieved final salvation in the Lord finds that his \nbody has completely fulfilled its purpose; he can then use it in any way he \ndeems fit. His work in the world is to alleviate the sorrows of mankind, \nwhether through spiritual means or by intellectual counsel or through will \n"}

Escaping to the \nsuperconsciousness whenever he so desires, a master can remain oblivious \nof physical suffering; sometimes he chooses to bear bodily pain stoically, \nas an example to disciples. By putting on the ailments of others, a yogi can \nsatisfy, for them, the karmic law of cause and effect. This law is \nmechanically or mathematically operative; its workings can be \nscientifically manipulated by men of divine wisdom.  \nThe spiritual law does not require a master to become ill whenever he \nheals another person. Healings ordinarily take place through the saint's \nknowledge of various methods of instantaneous cure in which no hurt to \nthe spiritual healer is involved. On rare occasions, however, a master who \nwishes to greatly quicken his disciples' evolution may then voluntarily \nwork out on his own body a large measure of their undesirable karma.  \nJesus signified himself as a ransom for the sins of many. With his divine \npowers, 21-4 his body could never have been subjected to death by \ncrucifixion if he had not willingly cooperated with the subtle cosmic law \nof cause and effect. He thus took on himself the consequences of others' \nkarma, especially that of his disciples. In this manner they were highly \npurified and made fit to receive the omnipresent consciousness which \nlater descended on them.  \nOnly a self-realized master can transfer his life force, or convey into his \nown body the diseases of others. An ordinary man cannot employ this \nyogic method of cure, nor is it desirable that he should do so; for an \nunsound physical instrument is a hindrance to God- meditation. The Hindu \nscriptures teach that the first duty of man is to keep his body in good \ncondition; otherwise his mind is unable to remain fixed in devotional \nconcentration.  \nA very strong mind, however, can transcend all physical difficulties and \nattain to God-realization. Many saints have ignored illness and succeeded \nin their divine quest. St. Francis of Assisi, severely afflicted with \nailments, healed others and even raised the dead.  \nI knew an Indian saint, half of whose body was once festering with sores. \nHis diabetic condition was so acute that under ordinary conditions he \ncould not sit still at one time for more than fifteen minutes. But his \nspiritual aspiration was undeterrable. \"Lord,\" he prayed, \"wilt Thou come \ninto my broken temple?\" With ceaseless command of will, the saint \n"}

Later I saw that it had become whole through the Divine \nMercy.\"  \nA historical healing incident concerns King Baber (1483-1530), founder of \nthe Mogul empire in India. His son, Prince Humayun, was mortally ill. The \nfather prayed with anguished determination that he receive the sickness, \nand that his son be spared. After all physicians had given up hope, \nHumayun recovered. Baber immediately fell sick and died of the same \ndisease which had stricken his son. Humayun succeeded Baber as Emperor \nof Hindustan.  \nMany people imagine that every spiritual master has, or should have, the \nhealth and strength of a Sandow. The assumption is unfounded. A sickly \nbody does not indicate that a guru is not in touch with divine powers, any \nmore than lifelong health necessarily indicates an inner illumination. The \ncondition of the physical body, in other words, cannot rightfully be made \na test of a master. His distinguishing qualifications must be sought in his \nown domain, the spiritual.  \nNumerous bewildered seekers in the West erroneously think that an \neloquent speaker or writer on metaphysics must be a master. The rishis, \nhowever, have pointed out that the acid test of a master is a man's \nability to enter at will the breathless state, and to maintain the unbroken \nsamadhi of nirbikalpa . 21-5 Only by these achievements can a human being \nprove that he has \"mastered\" maya or the dualistic Cosmic Delusion. He \nalone can say from the depths of realization: \"Ekam sat ,\"-\"Only One \nexists.\"  \n\"The Vedas declare that the ignorant man who rests content with making \nthe slightest distinction between the individual soul and the Supreme \nSelf is exposed to danger,\" Shankara the great monist has written. \n\"Where there is duality by virtue of ignorance, one sees all things as \ndistinct from the Self. When everything is seen as the Self, then there is \nnot even an atom other than the Self. . . .  \n"}

Selecting a shady spot near one of the pillars, I \narranged my body in the lotus posture. Although it was only about seven \no'clock, the morning sun would soon be oppressive.  \nThe world receded as I became devotionally entranced. My mind was \nconcentrated on Goddess Kali, whose image at Dakshineswar had been the \nspecial object of adoration by the great master, Sri Ramakrishna \nParamhansa. In answer to his anguished demands, the stone image of this \nvery temple had often taken a living form and conversed with him.  \n\"Silent Mother with stony heart,\" I prayed, \"Thou becamest filled with \nlife at the request of Thy beloved devotee Ramakrishna; why dost Thou \nnot also heed the wails of this yearning son of Thine?\"  \nMy aspiring zeal increased boundlessly, accompanied by a divine peace. \nYet, when five hours had passed, and the Goddess whom I was inwardly \nvisualizing had made no response, I felt slightly disheartened.

A \ndevout Christian sees Jesus; a Hindu beholds Krishna, or the Goddess \nKali, or an expanding Light if his worship takes an impersonal turn.  \nReluctantly I opened my eyes, and saw that the temple doors were being \nlocked by a priest, in conformance with a noon-hour custom.

First, a delightful cold \nwave descended over my back and under my feet, banishing all \ndiscomfort. Then, to my amazement, the temple became greatly \nmagnified. Its large door slowly opened, revealing the stone figure of \nGoddess Kali. Gradually it changed into a living form, smilingly nodding in \ngreeting, thrilling me with joy indescribable. As if by a mystic syringe, \nthe breath was withdrawn from my lungs; my body became very still, \nthough not inert.  \nAn ecstatic enlargement of consciousness followed. I could see clearly for \nseveral miles over the Ganges River to my left, and beyond the temple \ninto the entire Dakshineswar precincts. The walls of all buildings \nglimmered transparently; through them I observed people walking to and \nfro over distant acres.  \nThough I was breathless and my body in a strangely quiet state, yet I was \nable to move my hands and feet freely.

No longer could I see the glorious \nGoddess; the towering temple was reduced to its ordinary size, minus its \ntransparency. Again my body sweltered under the fierce rays of the sun. \nI jumped to the shelter of the pillared hall, where Satish pursued me \nangrily. I looked at my watch.

He flushed with \nemotion, lowering his gaze in silent repentance. When we were served a \nlavish meal, including out-of-season mangoes, I noticed that my brother-\nin-law's appetite was meager. He was bewildered, diving deep into the \nocean of thought. On the return journey to Calcutta, Satish, with \nsoftened expression, occasionally glanced at me pleadingly.

During my stay with him, I noticed \nthat Satish secretly spent the greater part of every night in divine \nmeditation, though he was suffering from a serious ailment, and was \nengaged during the day at his office.  \nThe thought came to me that my brother-in-law's life span would not be a \nlong one.

I \nwas in America when my sister died, about a year after her prediction.

One section of the questions \nhad been divided into two parts of A or B, and C or D. Instead of \nanswering one question from each part, I had carelessly answered both \nquestions in Group I, and had failed to consider anything in Group II. The \nbest mark I could score in that paper would be 33, three less than the \npassing mark of 36. I rushed to Master and poured out my troubles.  \n\"Sir, I have made an unpardonable blunder.

I \nquestioned him eagerly.  \n\"Long-haired monk,\" he said laughingly, \"why this sudden interest in \nscholastic matters? Why cry in the eleventh hour?

A significant incident \noccurred in connection with the examination in Bengali. Romesh, who had \ntouched little on that subject, called me back one morning as I was \nleaving the boardinghouse on my way to the examination hall.  \n\"There is Romesh shouting for you,\" a classmate said to me impatiently. \n\"Don't return; we shall be late at the hall.\"  \nIgnoring the advice, I ran back to the house.  \n\"The Bengali examination is usually easily passed by our Bengali boys,\" \nRomesh told me. \"But I have just had a hunch that this year the \nprofessors have planned to massacre the students by asking questions \nfrom our ancient literature.\" My friend then briefly outlined two stories \nfrom the life of Vidyasagar, a renowned philanthropist.  \nI thanked Romesh and quickly bicycled to the college hall. The \nexamination sheet in Bengali proved to contain two parts. The first \ninstruction was: \"Write two instances of the charities of Vidyasagar.\" As \nI transferred to the paper the lore that I had so recently acquired, I \nwhispered a few words of thanksgiving that I had heeded Romesh's last-\nminute summons. Had I been ignorant of Vidyasagar's benefactions to \nmankind (including ultimately myself), I could not have passed the Bengali \nexamination. Failing in one subject, I would have been forced to stand \nexamination anew in all subjects the following year. Such a prospect was \nunderstandably abhorrent.  \nThe second instruction on the sheet read: \"Write an essay in Bengali on \nthe life of the man who has most inspired you.\" Gentle reader, I need not \ninform you what man I chose for my theme. As I covered page after page \nwith praise of my guru, I smiled to realize that my muttered prediction \nwas coming true: \"I will fill up the sheets with your teachings!\"  \nI had not felt inclined to question Romesh about my course in philosophy. \nTrusting my long training under Sri Yukteswar, I safely disregarded the \ntextbook explanations. The highest mark given to any of my papers was \nthe one in philosophy. My score in all other subjects was just barely \nwithin the passing mark.  \nIt is a pleasure to record that my unselfish friend Romesh received his \nown degree cum laude.  \n"}

Launched on the sea of worldly responsibilities, they had \nforgotten their resolutions to meditate deeply.  \nTo allot God a secondary place in life was, to me, inconceivable. Though He \nis the sole Owner of the cosmos, silently showering us with gifts from life \nto life, one thing yet remains which He does not own, and which each \nhuman heart is empowered to withhold or bestow-man's love. The \nCreator, in taking infinite pains to shroud with mystery His presence in \nevery atom of creation, could have had but one motive-a sensitive desire \nthat men seek Him only through free will.

After the cloth had dried, my \nguru draped it around me as a renunciate's robe.  \n\"Someday you will go to the West, where silk is preferred,\" he said. \"As a \nsymbol, I have chosen for you this silk material instead of the customary \ncotton.\"  \nIn India, where monks embrace the ideal of poverty, a silk-clad swami is \nan unusual sight. Many yogis, however, wear garments of silk, which \npreserves certain subtle bodily currents better than cotton.  \n"}

The \nphysical body of the disciple is represented as dead, cremated in the \nflame of wisdom. The newly-made swami is then given a chant, such as: \n\"This atma is Brahma\" 24-2 or \"Thou art That\" or \"I am He.\" Sri \nYukteswar, however, with his love of simplicity, dispensed with all formal \nrites and merely asked me to select a new name.  \n\"I will give you the privilege of choosing it yourself,\" he said, smiling.  \n\"Yogananda,\" I replied, after a moment's thought. The name literally \nmeans \"Bliss (ananda ) through divine union (yoga ).\"  \n\"Be it so. Forsaking your family name of Mukunda Lal Ghosh, henceforth \nyou shall be called Yogananda of the Giri branch of the Swami Order.\"  \nAs I knelt before Sri Yukteswar, and for the first time heard him \npronounce my new name, my heart overflowed with gratitude. How lovingly \nand tirelessly had he labored, that the boy Mukunda be someday \ntransformed into the monk Yogananda! I joyfully sang a few verses from \nthe long Sanskrit chant of Lord Shankara:  \n  \"Mind, nor intellect, nor ego, feeling; \n  Sky nor earth nor metals am I. \n  I am He, I am He, Blessed Spirit, I am He! \n  No birth, no death, no caste have I; \n  Father, mother, have I none. \n  I am He, I am He, Blessed Spirit, I am He! \n  Beyond the flights of fancy, formless am I, \n  Permeating the limbs of all life; \n  Bondage I do not fear; I am free, ever free, \n  I am He, I am He, Blessed Spirit, I am He!\" \nEvery swami belongs to the ancient monastic order which was organized in \nits present form by Shankara. 24-3 Because it is a formal order, with an \nunbroken line of saintly representatives serving as active leaders, no man \ncan give himself the title of swami. He rightfully receives it only from \nanother swami; all monks thus trace their spiritual lineage to one common \nguru, Lord Shankara. By vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience to the \nspiritual teacher, many Catholic Christian monastic orders resemble the \nOrder of Swamis.  \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (1946 ed) (463p).pdf", "page": 218, "text": "In addition to his new name, usually ending in ananda , the swami takes a \ntitle which indicates his formal connection with one of the ten \nsubdivisions of the Swami Order. These dasanamis or ten agnomens \ninclude the Giri (mountain), to which Sri Yukteswar, and hence myself, \nbelong. Among the other branches are the Sagar (sea), Bharati (land), \nAranya (forest), Puri (tract), Tirtha (place of pilgrimage), and Saraswati \n(wisdom of nature).  \nThe new name received by a swami thus has a twofold significance, and \nrepresents the attainment of supreme bliss (ananda ) through some divine \nquality or state-love, wisdom, devotion, service, yoga-and through a \nharmony with nature, as expressed in her infinite vastness of oceans, \nmountains, skies.  \nThe ideal of selfless service to all mankind, and of renunciation of \npersonal ties and ambitions, leads the majority of swamis to engage \nactively in humanitarian and educational work in India, or occasionally in \nforeign lands. Ignoring all prejudices of caste, creed, class, color, sex, or \nrace, a swami follows the precepts of human brotherhood. His goal is \nabsolute unity with Spirit. Imbuing his waking and sleeping consciousness \nwith the thought, \"I am He,\" he roams contentedly, in the world but not \nof it. Thus only may he justify his title of swami-one who seeks to achieve \nunion with the Swa or Self. It is needless to add that not all formally \ntitled swamis are equally successful in reaching their high goal.  \nSri Yukteswar was both a swami and a yogi. A swami, formally a monk by \nvirtue of his connection with the ancient order, is not always a yogi. \nAnyone who practices a scientific technique of God-contact is a yogi; he \nmay be either married or unmarried, either a worldly man or one of \nformal religious ties. A swami may conceivably follow only the path of dry \nreasoning, of cold renunciation; but a yogi engages himself in a definite, \nstep-by-step procedure by which the body and mind are disciplined, and \nthe soul liberated. Taking nothing for granted on emotional grounds, or by \nfaith, a yogi practices a thoroughly tested series of exercises which were \nfirst mapped out by the early rishis. Yoga has produced, in every age of \nIndia, men who became truly free, truly Yogi-Christs.  \nLike any other science, yoga is applicable to people of every clime and \ntime.

Through the practical techniques of yoga, man leaves behind \nforever the barren realms of speculation and cognizes in experience the \nveritable Essence.  \nThe Yoga system as outlined by Patanjali is known as the Eightfold Path. \nThe first steps, (1) yama and (2) niyama , require observance of ten \nnegative and positive moralities-avoidance of injury to others, of \nuntruthfulness, of stealing, of incontinence, of gift-receiving (which \nbrings obligations); and purity of body and mind, contentment, self- \ndiscipline, study, and devotion to God.  \nThe next steps are (3) asana (right posture); the spinal column must be \nheld straight, and the body firm in a comfortable position for meditation; \n(4) pranayama (control of prana , subtle life currents); and (5) pratyahara \n(withdrawal of the senses from external objects).  \nThe last steps are forms of yoga proper: (6) dharana (concentration); \nholding the mind to one thought; (7) dhyana (meditation), and (8) samadhi \n(superconscious perception). This is the Eightfold Path of Yoga 24-6 which \nleads one to the final goal of Kaivalya (Absoluteness), a term which might \nbe more comprehensibly put as \"realization of the Truth beyond all \nintellectual apprehension.\"  \n\"Which is greater,\" one may ask, \"a swami or a yogi?\" If and when final \noneness with God is achieved, the distinctions of the various paths \ndisappear. The Bhagavad Gita, however, points out that the methods of \nyoga are all-embracive. Its techniques are not meant only for certain \ntypes and temperaments, such as those few who incline toward the \nmonastic life; yoga requires no formal allegiance. Because the yogic \nscience satisfies a universal need, it has a natural universal applicability.  \nA true yogi may remain dutifully in the world; there he is like butter on \nwater, and not like the easily-diluted milk of unchurned and undisciplined \nhumanity. To fulfill one's earthly responsibilities is indeed the higher \npath, provided the yogi, maintaining a mental uninvolvement with \negotistical desires, plays his part as a willing instrument of God.  \n"}

Through \ntheir disinterested service to mankind, or through their mastery over \npassions and thoughts, or through their single hearted love of God, or \nthrough their great powers of concentration, they are, in a sense, yogis; \nthey have set themselves the goal of yoga-self-control. These men could \nrise to even greater heights if they were taught the definite science of \nyoga, which makes possible a more conscious direction of one's mind and \nlife.  \nYoga has been superficially misunderstood by certain Western writers, \nbut its critics have never been its practitioners. Among many thoughtful \ntributes to yoga may be mentioned one by Dr. C. G. Jung, the famous \nSwiss psychologist.  \n\"When a religious method recommends itself as 'scientific,' it can be \ncertain of its public in the West. Yoga fulfills this expectation,\" Dr. Jung \nwrites. 24-7 \"Quite apart from the charm of the new, and the fascination \nof the half-understood, there is good cause for Yoga to have many \nadherents. It offers the possibility of controllable experience, and thus \nsatisfies the scientific need of 'facts,' and besides this, by reason of its \nbreadth and depth, its venerable age, its doctrine and method, which \ninclude every phase of life, it promises undreamed-of possibilities.  \n\"Every religious or philosophical practice means a psychological discipline, \nthat is, a method of mental hygiene. The manifold, purely bodily \nprocedures of Yoga 24-8 also mean a physiological hygiene which is superior \nto ordinary gymnastics and breathing exercises, inasmuch as it is not \nmerely mechanistic and scientific, but also philosophical; in its training of \nthe parts of the body, it unites them with the whole of the spirit, as is \nquite clear, for instance, in the Pranayama exercises where Prana is both \nthe breath and the universal dynamics of the cosmos.  \n\"When the thing which the individual is doing is also a cosmic event, the \neffect experienced in the body (the innervation), unites with the emotion \nof the spirit (the universal idea), and out of this there develops a lively \nunity which no technique, however scientific, can produce. Yoga practice \nis unthinkable, and would also be ineffectual, without the concepts on \nwhich Yoga is based. It combines the bodily and the spiritual with each \nother in an extraordinarily complete way.  \n"}

This unity creates a \npsychological disposition which makes possible intuitions that transcend \nconsciousness.\"  \nThe Western day is indeed nearing when the inner science of self- \ncontrol will be found as necessary as the outer conquest of nature. This \nnew Atomic Age will see men's minds sobered and broadened by the now \nscientifically indisputable truth that matter is in reality a concentrate of \nenergy. Finer forces of the human mind can and must liberate energies \ngreater than those within stones and metals, lest the material atomic \ngiant, newly unleashed, turn on the world in mindless destruction. 24-9  \n24-1: I Corinthians 7:32-33.  \n24-2: Literally, \"This soul is Spirit.\" The Supreme Spirit, the Uncreated, \nis wholly unconditioned (neti, neti not this, not that) but is often referred \nto in Vedanta as Sat-Chit-Ananda, that is, Being-Intelligence-Bliss.  \n24-3: Sometimes called Shankaracharya.

I was very thin; she was thinner still. Through an \nunconscious motive or \"complex\" which psychiatrists will have no \ndifficulty in identifying, I often used to tease my sister about her \ncadaverous appearance. Her retorts were equally permeated with the \ncallous frankness of extreme youth. Sometimes Mother intervened, \nending the childish quarrels, temporarily, by a gentle box on my ear, as \nthe elder ear.  \nTime passed; Nalini was betrothed to a young Calcutta physician, \nPanchanon Bose. He received a generous dowry from Father, presumably \n(as I remarked to Sister) to compensate the bridegroom-to-be for his \nfate in allying himself with a human bean-pole.  \nElaborate marriage rites were celebrated in due time. On the wedding \nnight, I joined the large and jovial group of relatives in the living room of \nour Calcutta home. The bridegroom was leaning on an immense gold-\nbrocaded pillow, with Nalini at his side. A gorgeous purple silk sari 25-1 \ncould not, alas, wholly hide her angularity. I sheltered myself behind the \npillow of my new brother-in-law and grinned at him in friendly fashion. He \nhad never seen Nalini until the day of the nuptial ceremony, when he \nfinally learned what he was getting in the matrimonial lottery.  \nFeeling my sympathy, Dr. Bose pointed unobtrusively to Nalini, and \nwhispered in my ear, \"Say, what's this?\"  \n\"Why, Doctor,\" I replied, \"it is a skeleton for your observation!\"  \nConvulsed with mirth, my brother-in-law and I were hard put to it to \nmaintain the proper decorum before our assembled relatives.  \nAs the years went on, Dr. Bose endeared himself to our family, who called \non him whenever illness arose. He and I became fast friends, often joking \ntogether, usually with Nalini as our target.  \n\"It is a medical curiosity,\" my brother-in-law remarked to me one day. \"I \nhave tried everything on your lean sister-cod liver oil, butter, malt, honey, \nfish, meat, eggs, tonics.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (1946 ed) (463p).pdf", "page": 229, "text": "The science of Kriya Yoga, mentioned so often in these pages, became \nwidely known in modern India through the instrumentality of Lahiri \nMahasaya, my guru's guru. The Sanskrit root of Kriya is kri, to do, to act \nand react; the same root is found in the word karma, the natural principle \nof cause and effect. Kriya Yoga is thus \"union (yoga) with the Infinite \nthrough a certain action or rite.\" A yogi who faithfully follows its \ntechnique is gradually freed from karma or the universal chain of \ncausation.  \nBecause of certain ancient yogic injunctions, I cannot give a full \nexplanation of Kriya Yoga in the pages of a book intended for the general \npublic. The actual technique must be learned from a Kriyaban or Kriya \nYogi; here a broad reference must suffice.  \nKriya Yoga is a simple, psychophysiological method by which the human \nblood is decarbonized and recharged with oxygen. The atoms of this \nextra oxygen are transmuted into life current to rejuvenate the brain \nand spinal centers. 26-1 By stopping the accumulation of venous blood, the \nyogi is able to lessen or prevent the decay of tissues; the advanced yogi \ntransmutes his cells into pure energy. Elijah, Jesus, Kabir and other \nprophets were past masters in the use of Kriya or a similar technique, by \nwhich they caused their bodies to dematerialize at will.  \nKriya is an ancient science. Lahiri Mahasaya received it from his guru, \nBabaji, who rediscovered and clarified the technique after it had been \nlost in the Dark Ages.  \n\"The Kriya Yoga which I am giving to the world through you in this \nnineteenth century,\" Babaji told Lahiri Mahasaya, \"is a revival of the same \nscience which Krishna gave, millenniums ago, to Arjuna, and which was \nlater known to Patanjali, and to Christ, St. John, St. Paul, and other \ndisciples.\"  \nKriya Yoga is referred to by Krishna, India's greatest prophet, in a \nstanza of the Bhagavad Gita: \"Offering inhaling breath into the outgoing \nbreath, and offering the outgoing breath into the inhaling breath, the \nyogi neutralizes both these breaths; he thus releases the life force from \nthe heart and brings it under his control.\" 26-2 The interpretation is: \"The \nyogi arrests decay in the body by an addition of life force, and arrests \nthe mutations of growth in the body by apan (eliminating current). Thus \nneutralizing decay and growth, by quieting the heart, the yogi learns life \ncontrol.\"  \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (1946 ed) (463p).pdf", "page": 230, "text": "Krishna also relates 26-3 that it was he, in a former incarnation, who \ncommunicated the indestructible yoga to an ancient illuminato, Vivasvat, \nwho gave it to Manu, the great legislator. 26-4 He, in turn, instructed \nIkshwaku, the father of India's solar warrior dynasty. Passing thus from \none to another, the royal yoga was guarded by the rishis until the coming \nof the materialistic ages. 26-5 Then, due to priestly secrecy and man's \nindifference, the sacred knowledge gradually became inaccessible.  \nKriya Yoga is mentioned twice by the ancient sage Patanjali, foremost \nexponent of yoga, who wrote: \"Kriya Yoga consists of body discipline, \nmental control, and meditating on Aum.\" 26-6 Patanjali speaks of God as \nthe actual Cosmic Sound of Aum heard in meditation. 26-7 Aum is the \nCreative Word, 26-8 the sound of the Vibratory Motor. Even the yoga-\nbeginner soon inwardly hears the wondrous sound of Aum. Receiving this \nblissful spiritual encouragement, the devotee becomes assured that he is \nin actual touch with divine realms.  \nPatanjali refers a second time to the life-control or Kriya technique thus: \n\"Liberation can be accomplished by that pranayama which is attained by \ndisjoining the course of inspiration and expiration.\" 26-9  \nSt. Paul knew Kriya Yoga, or a technique very similar to it, by which he \ncould switch life currents to and from the senses. He was therefore able \nto say: \"Verily, I protest by our rejoicing which I have in Christ, i die \ndaily.\" 26-10 By daily withdrawing his bodily life force, he united it by yoga \nunion with the rejoicing (eternal bliss) of the Christ consciousness. In \nthat felicitous state, he was consciously aware of being dead to the \ndelusive sensory world of maya.  \nIn the initial states of God-contact (sabikalpa samadhi) the devotee's \nconsciousness merges with the Cosmic Spirit; his life force is withdrawn \nfrom the body, which appears \"dead,\" or motionless and rigid. The yogi is \nfully aware of his bodily condition of suspended animation. As he \nprogresses to higher spiritual states (nirbikalpa samadhi), however, he \ncommunes with God without bodily fixation, and in his ordinary waking \nconsciousness, even in the midst of exacting worldly duties. 26-11  \n\"Kriya Yoga is an instrument through which human evolution can be \nquickened,\" Sri Yukteswar explained to his students. \"The ancient yogis \ndiscovered that the secret of cosmic consciousness is intimately linked \nwith breath mastery. This is India's unique and deathless contribution to \nthe world's treasury of knowledge. The life force, which is ordinarily \n"}

One-half minute of \nrevolution of energy around the sensitive spinal cord of man effects \nsubtle progress in his evolution; that half-minute of Kriya equals one year \nof natural spiritual unfoldment.  \nThe astral system of a human being, with six (twelve by polarity) inner \nconstellations revolving around the sun of the omniscient spiritual eye, is \ninterrelated with the physical sun and the twelve zodiacal signs. All men \nare thus affected by an inner and an outer universe. The ancient rishis \ndiscovered that man's earthly and heavenly environment, in twelve-year \ncycles, push him forward on his natural path. The scriptures aver that \nman requires a million years of normal, diseaseless evolution to perfect \nhis human brain sufficiently to express cosmic consciousness.  \nOne thousand Kriya practiced in eight hours gives the yogi, in one day, the \nequivalent of one thousand years of natural evolution: 365,000 years of \nevolution in one year. In three years, a Kriya Yogi can thus accomplish by \nintelligent self-effort the same result which nature brings to pass in a \nmillion years. The Kriya short cut, of course, can be taken only by deeply \ndeveloped yogis. With the guidance of a guru, such yogis have carefully \nprepared their bodies and brains to receive the power created by \nintensive practice.  \nThe Kriya beginner employs his yogic exercise only fourteen to twenty- \neight times, twice daily. A number of yogis achieve emancipation in six or \ntwelve or twenty-four or forty-eight years. A yogi who dies before \nachieving full realization carries with him the good karma of his past \nKriya effort; in his new life he is harmoniously propelled toward his \nInfinite Goal.  \nThe body of the average man is like a fifty-watt lamp, which cannot \naccommodate the billion watts of power roused by an excessive practice \nof Kriya. Through gradual and regular increase of the simple and \n\"foolproof\" methods of Kriya, man's body becomes astrally transformed \n"}

Their attempts to \nforcibly hold breath in the lungs is not only unnatural but decidedly \nunpleasant. Kriya, on the other hand, is accompanied from the very \nbeginning by an accession of peace, and by soothing sensations of \nregenerative effect in the spine.  \nThe ancient yogic technique converts the breath into mind. By spiritual \nadvancement, one is able to cognize the breath as an act of mind-a \ndream-breath.  \nMany illustrations could be given of the mathematical relationship \nbetween man's respiratory rate and the variations in his states of \nconsciousness. A person whose attention is wholly engrossed, as in \nfollowing some closely knit intellectual argument, or in attempting some \ndelicate or difficult physical feat, automatically breathes very slowly. \nFixity of attention depends on slow breathing; quick or uneven breaths \nare an inevitable accompaniment of harmful emotional states: fear, lust, \nanger. The restless monkey breathes at the rate of 32 times a minute, in \ncontrast to man's average of 18 times. The elephant, tortoise, snake and \nother animals noted for their longevity have a respiratory rate which is \nless than man's. The tortoise, for instance, who may attain the age of \n300 years, 26-12 breathes only 4 times per minute.  \nThe rejuvenating effects of sleep are due to man's temporary \nunawareness of body and breathing. The sleeping man becomes a yogi; \neach night he unconsciously performs the yogic rite of releasing himself \nfrom bodily identification, and of merging the life force with healing \ncurrents in the main brain region and the six sub-dynamos of his spinal \ncenters. The sleeper thus dips unknowingly into the reservoir of cosmic \nenergy which sustains all life.  \nThe voluntary yogi performs a simple, natural process consciously, not \nunconsciously like the slow-paced sleeper. The Kriya Yogi uses his \ntechnique to saturate and feed all his physical cells with undecaying light \nand keep them in a magnetized state. He scientifically makes breath \nunnecessary, without producing the states of subconscious sleep or \nunconsciousness.  \n"}

By such \nreinforcement of life, the yogi's body and brain cells are electrified with \nthe spiritual elixir. Thus he removes himself from studied observance of \nnatural laws, which can only take him-by circuitous means as given by \nproper food, sunlight, and harmonious thoughts-to a million-year Goal. It \nneeds twelve years of normal healthful living to effect even slight \nperceptible change in brain structure, and a million solar returns are \nexacted to sufficiently refine the cerebral tenement for manifestation \nof cosmic consciousness.  \nUntying the cord of breath which binds the soul to the body, Kriya serves \nto prolong life and enlarge the consciousness to infinity. The yoga method \novercomes the tug of war between the mind and the matter- bound \nsenses, and frees the devotee to reinherit his eternal kingdom. He knows \nhis real nature is bound neither by physical encasement nor by breath, \nsymbol of the mortal enslavement to air, to nature's elemental \ncompulsions.  \nIntrospection, or \"sitting in the silence,\" is an unscientific way of trying \nto force apart the mind and senses, tied together by the life force. The \ncontemplative mind, attempting its return to divinity, is constantly \ndragged back toward the senses by the life currents. Kriya, controlling \nthe mind directly through the life force, is the easiest, most effective, \nand most scientific avenue of approach to the Infinite. In contrast to the \nslow, uncertain \"bullock cart\" theological path to God, Kriya may justly be \ncalled the \"airplane\" route.  \nThe yogic science is based on an empirical consideration of all forms of \nconcentration and meditation exercises. Yoga enables the devotee to \nswitch off or on, at will, life current from the five sense telephones of \nsight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Attaining this power of sense-\ndisconnection, the yogi finds it simple to unite his mind at will with divine \nrealms or with the world of matter. No longer is he unwillingly brought \nback by the life force to the mundane sphere of rowdy sensations and \nrestless thoughts. Master of his body and mind, the Kriya Yogi ultimately \nachieves victory over the \"last enemy,\" death.  \nSo shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men: And Death once dead, \nthere's no more dying then. 26-13  \n"}

The devotee thus avoids \nthe slow, evolutionary monitors of egoistic actions, good and bad, of \ncommon life, cumbrous and snail-like to the eagle hearts.  \nThe superior method of soul living frees the yogi who, shorn of his ego-\nprison, tastes the deep air of omnipresence. The thralldom of natural \nliving is, in contrast, set in a pace humiliating. Conforming his life to the \nevolutionary order, a man can command no concessionary haste from \nnature but, living without error against the laws of his physical and mental \nendowment, still requires about a million years of incarnating masquerades \nto know final emancipation.  \nThe telescopic methods of yogis, disengaging themselves from physical \nand mental identifications in favor of soul-individuality, thus commend \nthemselves to those who eye with revolt a thousand thousand years. This \nnumerical periphery is enlarged for the ordinary man, who lives in \nharmony not even with nature, let alone his soul, but pursues instead \nunnatural complexities, thus offending in his body and thoughts the sweet \nsanities of nature. For him, two times a million years can scarce suffice \nfor liberation.  \nGross man seldom or never realizes that his body is a kingdom, governed \nby Emperor Soul on the throne of the cranium, with subsidiary regents in \nthe six spinal centers or spheres of consciousness.

Any apparent insurrection of bodily or cerebral cells toward \nEmperor Soul, manifesting as disease or depression, is due to no \ndisloyalty among the humble citizens, but to past or present misuse by \nman of his individuality or free will, given to him simultaneous with a soul, \nand revocable never.  \nIdentifying himself with a shallow ego, man takes for granted that it is \nhe who thinks, wills, feels, digests meals, and keeps himself alive, never \nadmitting through reflection (only a little would suffice!) that in his \nordinary life he is naught but a puppet of past actions (karma) and of \nnature or environment.

Knowledge cannot \nspring up by any other means than inquiry. 'Who am I? How was this \nuniverse born? Who is its maker? What is its material cause?' This is the \nkind of inquiry referred to.\" The intellect has no answer for these \nquestions; hence the rishis evolved yoga as the technique of spiritual \ninquiry.  \nKriya Yoga is the real \"fire rite\" often extolled in the Bhagavad Gita. The \npurifying fires of yoga bring eternal illumination, and thus differ much \nfrom outward and little-effective religious fire ceremonies, where \nperception of truth is oft burnt, to solemn chanted accompaniment, along \nwith the incense!  \nThe advanced yogi, withholding all his mind, will, and feeling from false \nidentification with bodily desires, uniting his mind with superconscious \nforces in the spinal shrines, thus lives in this world as God hath planned, \nnot impelled by impulses from the past nor by new witlessnesses of fresh \nhuman motivations. Such a yogi receives fulfillment of his Supreme \nDesire, safe in the final haven of inexhaustibly blissful Spirit.  \nThe yogi offers his labyrinthine human longings to a monotheistic bonfire \ndedicated to the unparalleled God. This is indeed the true yogic fire \nceremony, in which all past and present desires are fuel consumed by love \ndivine.

His bones stripped of all desirous flesh, his \nkarmic skeleton bleached in the antiseptic suns of wisdom, he is clean at \nlast, inoffensive before man and Maker.  \nReferring to yoga's sure and methodical efficacy, Lord Krishna praises \nthe technological yogi in the following words: \"The yogi is greater than \nbody-disciplining ascetics, greater even than the followers of the path of \nwisdom (Jnana Yoga), or of the path of action (Karma Yoga); be thou, O \ndisciple Arjuna, a yogi!\" 26-14  \n"}

The pond before us was inviting, \nbut a distaste for it had arisen in my mind. The group around me followed \nmy example of dipping buckets, but a few lads yielded to the temptation \nof the cool waters. No sooner had they dived than large water snakes \nwiggled around them. The boys came out of the pond with comical \nalacrity.  \nWe enjoyed a picnic lunch after we reached our destination. I sat under a \ntree, surrounded by a group of students. Finding me in an inspirational \nmood, they plied me with questions.  \n\"Please tell me, sir,\" one youth inquired, \"if I shall always stay with you in \nthe path of renunciation.\"  \n\"Ah, no,\" I replied, \"you will be forcibly taken away to your home, and \nlater you will marry.\"  \nIncredulous, he made a vehement protest. \"Only if I am dead can I be \ncarried home.\" But in a few months, his parents arrived to take him away, \nin spite of his tearful resistance; some years later, he did marry.  \nAfter answering many questions, I was addressed by a lad named Kashi. \nHe was about twelve years old, a brilliant student, and beloved by all.  \n\"Sir,\" he said, \"what will be my fate?\"  \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Autobiography of a Yogi (1946 ed) (463p).pdf", "page": 247, "text": "\"You shall soon be dead.\" The reply came from my lips with an irresistible \nforce.  \nThis unexpected disclosure shocked and grieved me as well as everyone \npresent. Silently rebuking myself as an enfant terrible, I refused to \nanswer further questions.  \nOn our return to the school, Kashi came to my room.  \n\"If I die, will you find me when I am reborn, and bring me again to the \nspiritual path?\" He sobbed.  \nI felt constrained to refuse this difficult occult responsibility. But for \nweeks afterward, Kashi pressed me doggedly. Seeing him unnerved to the \nbreaking point, I finally consoled him.  \n\"Yes,\" I promised. \"If the Heavenly Father lends His aid, I will try to find \nyou.\"  \nDuring the summer vacation, I started on a short trip. Regretting that I \ncould not take Kashi with me, I called him to my room before leaving, and \ncarefully instructed him to remain, against all persuasion, in the spiritual \nvibrations of the school. Somehow I felt that if he did not go home, he \nmight avoid the impending calamity.  \nNo sooner had I left than Kashi's father arrived in Ranchi. For fifteen \ndays he tried to break the will of his son, explaining that if Kashi would go \nto Calcutta for only four days to see his mother, he could then return. \nKashi persistently refused. The father finally said he would take the boy \naway with the help of the police. The threat disturbed Kashi, who was \nunwilling to be the cause of any unfavorable publicity to the school. He \nsaw no choice but to go.  \nI returned to Ranchi a few days later. When I heard how Kashi had been \nremoved, I entrained at once for Calcutta. There I engaged a horse cab. \nVery strangely, as the vehicle passed beyond the Howrah bridge over the \nGanges, I beheld Kashi's father and other relatives in mourning clothes. \nShouting to my driver to stop, I rushed out and glared at the unfortunate \nfather.  \n\"Mr. Murderer,\" I cried somewhat unreasonably, \"you have killed my boy!\"  \n"}

His \nsongs embody deep philosophic truth in emotionally appealing terms, with \nlittle regard for the accepted literary forms.  \n\"One influential critic slightingly referred to Rabindranath as a 'pigeon-\npoet who sold his cooings in print for a rupee.' But Tagore's revenge was \nat hand; the whole Western world paid homage at his feet soon after he \nhad translated into English his Gitanjali (\"Song Offerings\"). A trainload \nof pundits, including his one-time critics, went to Santiniketan to offer \ntheir congratulations.  \n\"Rabindranath received his guests only after an intentionally long delay, \nand then heard their praise in stoic silence. Finally he turned against \nthem their own habitual weapons of criticism.  \n\"'Gentlemen,' he said, 'the fragrant honors you here bestow are \nincongruously mingled with the putrid odors of your past contempt. Is \nthere possibly any connection between my award of the Nobel Prize, and \nyour suddenly acute powers of appreciation?

Replying to my question about his literary \nbackground, Tagore told me that one ancient source of his inspiration, \nbesides our religious epics, had been the classical poet, Bidyapati.\"  \nInspired by these memories, I began to sing Tagore's version of an old \nBengali song, \"Light the Lamp of Thy Love.\" Bhola and I chanted joyously \nas we strolled over the Vidyalaya grounds.  \nAbout two years after founding the Ranchi school, I received an \ninvitation from Rabindranath to visit him at Santiniketan in order to \ndiscuss our educational ideals. I went gladly. The poet was seated in his \nstudy when I entered; I thought then, as at our first meeting, that he \nwas as striking a model of superb manhood as any painter could desire. \nHis beautifully chiseled face, nobly patrician, was framed in long hair and \nflowing beard. Large, melting eyes; an angelic smile; and a voice of \nflutelike quality which was literally enchanting. Stalwart, tall, and grave, \nhe combined an almost womanly tenderness with the delightful \nspontaneity of a child.

Its \nmirages of reality all break down under analysis. As one by one the \nreassuring props of a physical cosmos crash beneath him, man dimly \nperceives his idolatrous reliance, his past transgression of the divine \ncommand: \"Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.\"  \nIn his famous equation outlining the equivalence of mass and energy, \nEinstein proved that the energy in any particle of matter is equal to its \nmass or weight multiplied by the square of the velocity of light.

She received me graciously at \nthe old Lahiri homestead in the Garudeswar Mohulla section of Benares. \nAlthough aged, she was blooming like a lotus, silently emanating a spiritual \nfragrance.

I felt honored to witness the shrine in which the \npeerless master had condescended to play the human drama of \nmatrimony. The gentle lady motioned me to a pillow seat by her side.  \n\"It was years before I came to realize the divine stature of my husband,\" \nshe began. \"One night, in this very room, I had a vivid dream.

These two \nsaintly sons of India's great yogi followed closely in his ideal footsteps. \nBoth men were fair, tall, stalwart, and heavily bearded, with soft voices \nand an old-fashioned charm of manner.  \nHis wife was not the only woman disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya; there were \nhundreds of others, including my mother. A woman chela once asked the \nguru for his photograph. He handed her a print, remarking, \"If you deem \nit a protection, then it is so; otherwise it is only a picture.\"  \nA few days later this woman and Lahiri Mahasaya's daughter-in-law \nhappened to be studying the Bhagavad Gita at a table behind which hung \nthe guru's photograph. An electrical storm broke out with great fury.  \n\"Lahiri Mahasaya, protect us!\" The women bowed before the picture. \nLightning struck the book which they had been reading, but the two \ndevotees were unhurt.  \n\"I felt as though a sheet of ice had been placed around me to ward off \nthe scorching heat,\" the chela explained.  \nLahiri Mahasaya performed two miracles in connection with a woman \ndisciple, Abhoya. She and her husband, a Calcutta lawyer, started one day \nfor Benares to visit the guru. Their carriage was delayed by heavy \ntraffic; they reached the Howrah main station only to hear the Benares \ntrain whistling for departure.  \nAbhoya, near the ticket office, stood quietly.  \n\"Lahiri Mahasaya, I beseech thee to stop the train!\" she silently prayed. \n\"I cannot suffer the pangs of delay in waiting another day to see thee.\"  \nThe wheels of the snorting train continued to move round and round, but \nthere was no onward progress. The engineer and passengers descended to \nthe platform to view the phenomenon. An English railroad guard \napproached Abhoya and her husband.

This time \nshe wanted his intercession, not with a train, but with the stork.  \n\"I pray you to bless me that my ninth child may live,\" she said. \"Eight \nbabies have been born to me; all died soon after birth.\"  \nThe master smiled sympathetically. \"Your coming child will live.

The mother instructed her nurse to keep the lamp filled \nwith oil. Both women kept the urgent vigil far into the early morning \nhours, but finally fell asleep. The lamp oil was almost gone; the light \nflickered feebly.  \nThe bedroom door unlatched and flew open with a violent sound. The \nstartled women awoke. Their astonished eyes beheld the form of Lahiri \nMahasaya.  \n\"Abhoya, behold, the light is almost gone!\" He pointed to the lamp, which \nthe nurse hastened to refill. As soon as it burned again brightly, the \nmaster vanished.

Sometimes they would engage \nin discussion of meditational and philosophical points. At dawn the exalted \nguests would depart. I found during my visits that Lahiri Mahasaya did \nnot once lie down to sleep.  \n\"During an early period of my association with the master, I had to \ncontend with the opposition of my employer,\" Roy went on. \"He was \nsteeped in materialism.  \n\"'I don't want religious fanatics on my staff,' he would sneer. 'If I ever \nmeet your charlatan guru, I shall give him some words to remember.'  \n\"This alarming threat failed to interrupt my regular program; I spent \nnearly every evening in my guru's presence. One night my employer \nfollowed me and rushed rudely into the parlor. He was doubtless fully \nbent on uttering the pulverizing remarks he had promised. No sooner had \nthe man seated himself than Lahiri Mahasaya addressed the little group \nof about twelve disciples.  \n\"'Would you all like to see a picture?'  \n\"When we nodded, he asked us to darken the room. 'Sit behind one \nanother in a circle,' he said, 'and place your hands over the eyes of the \nman in front of you.'  \n\"I was not surprised to see that my employer also was following, albeit \nunwillingly, the master's directions. In a few minutes Lahiri Mahasaya \nasked us what we were seeing.  \n\"'Sir,' I replied, 'a beautiful woman appears. She wears a red- bordered \nsari, and stands near an elephant-ear plant.' All the other disciples gave \nthe same description. The master turned to my employer. 'Do you \nrecognize that woman?'  \n\"'Yes.' The man was evidently struggling with emotions new to his nature. \n'I have been foolishly spending my money on her, though I have a good \nwife. I am ashamed of the motives which brought me here. Will you \nforgive me, and receive me as a disciple?'  \n"}

The \nmaster enigmatically added, 'Otherwise I won't have to initiate you.'  \n\"For three months my employer refrained from temptation; then he \nresumed his former relationship with the woman. Two months later he \ndied. Thus I came to understand my guru's veiled prophecy about the \nimprobability of the man's initiation.\"  \nLahiri Mahasaya had a very famous friend, Swami Trailanga, who was \nreputed to be over three hundred years old. The two yogis often sat \ntogether in meditation. Trailanga's fame is so widespread that few \nHindus would deny the possibility of truth in any story of his astounding \nmiracles. If Christ returned to earth and walked the streets of New \nYork, displaying his divine powers, it would cause the same excitement \nthat was created by Trailanga decades ago as he passed through the \ncrowded lanes of Benares.  \nOn many occasions the swami was seen to drink, with no ill effect, the \nmost deadly poisons. Thousands of people, including a few who are still \nliving, have seen Trailanga floating on the Ganges. For days together he \nwould sit on top of the water, or remain hidden for very long periods \nunder the waves. A common sight at the Benares bathing ghats was the \nswami's motionless body on the blistering stone slabs, wholly exposed to \nthe merciless Indian sun. By these feats Trailanga sought to teach men \nthat a yogi's life does not depend upon oxygen or ordinary conditions and \nprecautions. Whether he were above water or under it, and whether or \nnot his body lay exposed to the fierce solar rays, the master proved that \nhe lived by divine consciousness: death could not touch him.  \nThe yogi was great not only spiritually, but physically. His weight \nexceeded three hundred pounds: a pound for each year of his life! As he \nate very seldom, the mystery is increased. A master, however, easily \nignores all usual rules of health, when he desires to do so for some special \nreason, often a subtle one known only to himself. Great saints who have \nawakened from the cosmic mayic dream and realized this world as an idea \nin the Divine Mind, can do as they wish with the body, knowing it to be \nonly a manipulatable form of condensed or frozen energy. Though physical \nscientists now understand that matter is nothing but congealed energy, \nfully-illumined masters have long passed from theory to practice in the \nfield of matter-control.  \n"}

The harassed police of \nBenares came to regard him as a baffling problem child. The natural \nswami, like the early Adam in the garden of Eden, was utterly unconscious \nof his nakedness. The police were quite conscious of it, however, and \nunceremoniously committed him to jail. General embarrassment ensued; \nthe enormous body of Trailanga was soon seen, in its usual entirety, on \nthe prison roof. His cell, still securely locked, offered no clue to his mode \nof escape.  \nThe discouraged officers of the law once more performed their duty. \nThis time a guard was posted before the swami's cell. Might again retired \nbefore right. Trailanga was soon observed in his nonchalant stroll over \nthe roof. Justice is blind; the outwitted police decided to follow her \nexample.  \nThe great yogi preserved a habitual silence. 31-4 In spite of his round face \nand huge, barrel-like stomach, Trailanga ate only occasionally. After \nweeks without food, he would break his fast with potfuls of clabbered \nmilk offered to him by devotees. A skeptic once determined to expose \nTrailanga as a charlatan. A large bucket of calcium-lime mixture, used in \nwhitewashing walls, was placed before the swami.  \n\"Master,\" the materialist said, in mock reverence, \"I have brought you \nsome clabbered milk. Please drink it.\"  \nTrailanga unhesitatingly drained, to the last drop, the containerful of \nburning lime. In a few minutes the evildoer fell to the ground in agony.  \n\"Help, swami, help!\" he cried. \"I am on fire! Forgive my wicked test!\"  \nThe great yogi broke his habitual silence. \"Scoffer,\" he said, \"you did not \nrealize when you offered me poison that my life is one with your own. \nExcept for my knowledge that God is present in my stomach, as in every \natom of creation, the lime would have killed me. Now that you know the \ndivine meaning of boomerang, never again play tricks on anyone.\"  \nThe well-purged sinner, healed by Trailanga's words, slunk feebly away.  \nThe reversal of pain was not due to any volition of the master, but came \nabout through unerring application of the law of justice which upholds \ncreation's farthest swinging orb. Men of God-realization like Trailanga \nallow the divine law to operate instantaneously; they have banished \nforever all thwarting crosscurrents of ego.  \n"}

Dull minds discredit the possibility of \ndivine justice, love, omniscience, immortality. \"Airy scriptural \nconjectures!\" This insensitive viewpoint, aweless before the cosmic \nspectacle, arouses a train of events which brings its own awakening.  \nThe omnipotence of spiritual law was referred to by Christ on the \noccasion of his triumphant entry into Jerusalem.

As well may you \nhope to throttle the voice of God, whose very stones sing His glory and \nHis omnipresence.

'I know now that your \nsimple word is binding on the whole cosmos.'\"  \nAs Sri Yukteswar finished the awesome story, one of the spellbound \nlisteners ventured a question that, from a child, was doubly \nunderstandable.  \n\"Sir,\" he said, \"why did your guru use castor oil?\"  \n\"Child, giving the oil had no meaning except that I expected something \nmaterial and Lahiri Mahasaya chose the near-by oil as an objective symbol \nfor awakening my greater faith.

I cannot but be struck by \nthe coincidence that the year 1945 has also ushered in a new age-the era \nof revolutionary atomic energies. All thoughtful minds turn as never \nbefore to the urgent problems of peace and brotherhood, lest the \ncontinued use of physical force banish all men along with the problems.  \nThough the human race and its works disappear tracelessly by time or \nbomb, the sun does not falter in its course; the stars keep their \ninvariable vigil. Cosmic law cannot be stayed or changed, and man would do \nwell to put himself in harmony with it. If the cosmos is against might, if \nthe sun wars not with the planets but retires at dueful time to give the \nstars their little sway, what avails our mailed fist? Shall any peace indeed \ncome out of it? Not cruelty but good will arms the universal sinews; a \nhumanity at peace will know the endless fruits of victory, sweeter to the \ntaste than any nurtured on the soil of blood.  \nThe effective League of Nations will be a natural, nameless league of \nhuman hearts. The broad sympathies and discerning insight needed for \nthe healing of earthly woes cannot flow from a mere intellectual \nconsideration of man's diversities, but from knowledge of man's sole \nunity-his kinship with God. Toward realization of the world's highest \nideal-peace through brotherhood-may yoga, the science of personal \ncontact with the Divine, spread in time to all men in all lands.  \nThough India's civilization is ancient above any other, few historians have \nnoted that her feat of national survival is by no means an accident, but a \nlogical incident in the devotion to eternal verities which India has offered \nthrough her best men in every generation. By sheer continuity of being, \nby intransitivity before the ages-can dusty scholars truly tell us how \nmany?-India has given the worthiest answer of any people to the \nchallenge of time.  \nThe Biblical story 32-5 of Abraham's plea to the Lord that the city of \nSodom be spared if ten righteous men could be found therein, and the \ndivine reply: \"I will not destroy it for ten's sake,\" gains new meaning in \n"}

Heeding such \npersuasions, India has proved herself not witless against the thousand \ncunnings of time. Self-realized masters in every century have hallowed \nher soil; modern Christlike sages, like Lahiri Mahasaya and his disciple Sri \nYukteswar, rise up to proclaim that the science of yoga is more vital than \nany material advances to man's happiness and to a nation's longevity.  \nVery scanty information about the life of Lahiri Mahasaya and his \nuniversal doctrine has ever appeared in print. For three decades in India, \nAmerica, and Europe, I have found a deep and sincere interest in his \nmessage of liberating yoga; a written account of the master's life, even \nas he foretold, is now needed in the West, where lives of the great \nmodern yogis are little known.  \nNothing but one or two small pamphlets in English has been written on the \nguru's life. One biography in Bengali, Sri Sri 32-6 Shyama Charan Lahiri \nMahasaya, appeared in 1941. It was written by my disciple, Swami \nSatyananda, who for many years has been the acharya (spiritual \npreceptor) at our Vidyalaya in Ranchi. I have translated a few passages \nfrom his book and have incorporated them into this section devoted to \nLahiri Mahasaya.  \nIt was into a pious Brahmin family of ancient lineage that Lahiri Mahasaya \nwas born September 30, 1828. His birthplace was the village of Ghurni in \nthe Nadia district near Krishnagar, Bengal. He was the youngest son of \nMuktakashi, the second wife of the esteemed Gaur Mohan Lahiri. (His \nfirst wife, after the birth of three sons, had died during a pilgrimage.) \nThe boy's mother passed away during his childhood; little about her is \nknown except the revealing fact that she was an ardent devotee of Lord \nShiva, 32-7 scripturally designated as the \"King of Yogis.\"  \nThe boy Lahiri, whose given name was Shyama Charan, spent his early \nyears in the ancestral home at Nadia. At the age of three or four he was \noften observed sitting under the sands in the posture of a yogi, his body \ncompletely hidden except for the head.  \n"}

One of the Shiva temples founded by the Lahiris went into the \nriver along with the family home. A devotee rescued the stone image of \nLord Shiva from the swirling waters and placed it in a new temple, now \nwell-known as the Ghurni Shiva Site.  \nGaur Mohan Lahiri and his family left Nadia and became residents of \nBenares, where the father immediately erected a Shiva temple. He \nconducted his household along the lines of Vedic discipline, with regular \nobservance of ceremonial worship, acts of charity, and scriptural study. \nJust and open-minded, however, he did not ignore the beneficial current \nof modern ideas.  \nThe boy Lahiri took lessons in Hindi and Urdu in Benares study-groups. He \nattended a school conducted by Joy Narayan Ghosal, receiving instruction \nin Sanskrit, Bengali, French, and English. Applying himself to a close study \nof the Vedas, the young yogi listened eagerly to scriptural discussions by \nlearned Brahmins, including a Marhatta pundit named Nag-Bhatta.  \nShyama Charan was a kind, gentle, and courageous youth, beloved by all \nhis companions. With a well-proportioned, bright, and powerful body, he \nexcelled in swimming and in many skillful activities.  \nIn 1846 Shyama Charan Lahiri was married to Srimati Kashi Moni, \ndaughter of Sri Debnarayan Sanyal. A model Indian housewife, Kashi Moni \ncheerfully carried on her home duties and the traditional householder's \nobligation to serve guests and the poor. Two saintly sons, Tincouri and \nDucouri, blessed the union.  \nAt the age of 23, in 1851, Lahiri Mahasaya took the post of accountant in \nthe Military Engineering Department of the English government. He \nreceived many promotions during the time of his service. Thus not only \nwas he a master before God's eyes, but also a success in the little human \ndrama where he played his given role as an office worker in the world.  \nAs the offices of the Army Department were shifted, Lahiri Mahasaya \nwas transferred to Gazipur, Mirjapur, Danapur, Naini Tal, Benares, and \nother localities.

The secluded master \nhas retained his physical form for centuries, perhaps for millenniums. The \ndeathless Babaji is an avatara. This Sanskrit word means \"descent\"; its \nroots are ava, \"down,\" and tri, \"to pass.\" In the Hindu scriptures, avatara \nsignifies the descent of Divinity into flesh.  \n\"Babaji's spiritual state is beyond human comprehension,\" Sri Yukteswar \nexplained to me. \"The dwarfed vision of men cannot pierce to his \ntranscendental star. One attempts in vain even to picture the avatar's \nattainment. It is inconceivable.\"  \nThe Upanishads have minutely classified every stage of spiritual \nadvancement. A siddha (\"perfected being\") has progressed from the \nstate of a jivanmukta (\"freed while living\") to that of a paramukta \n(\"supremely free\"-full power over death); the latter has completely \nescaped from the mayic thralldom and its reincarnational round. The \nparamukta therefore seldom returns to a physical body; if he does, he is \nan avatar, a divinely appointed medium of supernal blessings on the world.  \nAn avatar is unsubject to the universal economy; his pure body, visible as \na light image, is free from any debt to nature. The casual gaze may see \nnothing extraordinary in an avatar's form but it casts no shadow nor \nmakes any footprint on the ground. These are outward symbolic proofs of \nan inward lack of darkness and material bondage. Such a God-man alone \nknows the Truth behind the relativities of life and death. Omar Khayyam, \nso grossly misunderstood, sang of this liberated man in his immortal \nscripture, the Rubaiyat:  \n\"Ah, Moon of my Delight who know'st no wane, The Moon of Heav'n is \nrising once again; How oft hereafter rising shall she look Through this \nsame Garden after me-in vain!\"  \nThe \"Moon of Delight\" is God, eternal Polaris, anachronous never. The \n\"Moon of Heav'n\" is the outward cosmos, fettered to the law of periodic \nrecurrence. Its chains had been dissolved forever by the Persian seer \nthrough his self-realization. \"How oft hereafter rising shall she look . . . \nafter me-in vain!\" What frustration of search by a frantic universe for an \nabsolute omission!  \nChrist expressed his freedom in another way: \"And a certain scribe came, \nand said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. \n"}

A considerable poetic literature in Tamil has grown up around \nAgastya, a South Indian avatar. He worked many miracles during the \ncenturies preceding and following the Christian era, and is credited with \nretaining his physical form even to this day.  \nBabaji's mission in India has been to assist prophets in carrying out their \nspecial dispensations.

The work of these two fully-illumined masters-one \nwith the body, and one without it-is to inspire the nations to forsake \nsuicidal wars, race hatreds, religious sectarianism, and the boomerang-\nevils of materialism. Babaji is well aware of the trend of modern times, \nespecially of the influence and complexities of Western civilization, and \nrealizes the necessity of spreading the self-liberations of yoga equally in \nthe West and in the East.  \nThat there is no historical reference to Babaji need not surprise us. The \ngreat guru has never openly appeared in any century; the misinterpreting \nglare of publicity has no place in his millennial plans. Like the Creator, the \nsole but silent Power, Babaji works in a humble obscurity.  \nGreat prophets like Christ and Krishna come to earth for a specific and \nspectacular purpose; they depart as soon as it is accomplished. Other \navatars, like Babaji, undertake work which is concerned more with the \nslow evolutionary progress of man during the centuries than with any one \noutstanding event of history. Such masters always veil themselves from \nthe gross public gaze, and have the power to become invisible at will. For \nthese reasons, and because they generally instruct their disciples to \nmaintain silence about them, a number of towering spiritual figures \nremain world-unknown. I give in these pages on Babaji merely a hint of his \nlife-only a few facts which he deems it fit and helpful to be publicly \nimparted.  \nNo limiting facts about Babaji's family or birthplace, dear to the \nannalist's heart, have ever been discovered. His speech is generally in \nHindi, but he converses easily in any language. He has adopted the simple \nname of Babaji (revered father); other titles of respect given him by \nLahiri Mahasaya's disciples are Mahamuni Babaji Maharaj (supreme \necstatic saint), Maha Yogi (greatest of yogis), Trambak Baba and Shiva \nBaba (titles of avatars of Shiva). Does it matter that we know not the \npatronymic of an earth-released master?  \n\"Whenever anyone utters with reverence the name of Babaji,\" Lahiri \nMahasaya said, \"that devotee attracts an instant spiritual blessing.\"  \nThe deathless guru bears no marks of age on his body; he appears to be \nno more than a youth of twenty-five.

The similarity is so striking \nthat, in his later years, Lahiri Mahasaya might have passed as the father \nof the youthful-looking Babaji.  \nSwami Kebalananda, my saintly Sanskrit tutor, spent some time with \nBabaji in the Himalayas.  \n\"The peerless master moves with his group from place to place in the \nmountains,\" Kebalananda told me. \"His small band contains two highly \nadvanced American disciples. After Babaji has been in one locality for \nsome time, he says: 'Dera danda uthao.' ('Let us lift our camp and staff.') \nHe carries a symbolic danda (bamboo staff). His words are the signal for \nmoving with his group instantaneously to another place. He does not \nalways employ this method of astral travel; sometimes he goes on foot \nfrom peak to peak.  \n\"Babaji can be seen or recognized by others only when he so desires. He \nis known to have appeared in many slightly different forms to various \ndevotees-sometimes without beard and moustache, and sometimes with \nthem. As his undecaying body requires no food, the master seldom eats. \nAs a social courtesy to visiting disciples, he occasionally accepts fruits, or \nrice cooked in milk and clarified butter.  \n\"Two amazing incidents of Babaji's life are known to me,\" Kebalananda \nwent on. \"His disciples were sitting one night around a huge fire which \nwas blazing for a sacred Vedic ceremony. The master suddenly seized a \nburning log and lightly struck the bare shoulder of a chela who was close \nto the fire.  \n\"'Sir, how cruel!' Lahiri Mahasaya, who was present, made this \nremonstrance.  \n\"'Would you rather have seen him burned to ashes before your eyes, \naccording to the decree of his past karma?'  \n\"With these words Babaji placed his healing hand on the chela's \ndisfigured shoulder. 'I have freed you tonight from painful death. The \nkarmic law has been satisfied through your slight suffering by fire.'  \n"}

He had climbed with astonishing skill to the nearly \ninaccessible ledge near the camp of the master.  \n\"'Sir, you must be the great Babaji.' The man's face was lit with \ninexpressible reverence. 'For months I have pursued a ceaseless search \nfor you among these forbidding crags. I implore you to accept me as a \ndisciple.'  \n\"When the great guru made no response, the man pointed to the rocky \nchasm at his feet.  \n\"'If you refuse me, I will jump from this mountain. Life has no further \nvalue if I cannot win your guidance to the Divine.'  \n\"'Jump then,' Babaji said unemotionally. 'I cannot accept you in your \npresent state of development.'  \n\"The man immediately hurled himself over the cliff. Babaji instructed the \nshocked disciples to fetch the stranger's body. When they returned with \nthe mangled form, the master placed his divine hand on the dead man. Lo! \nhe opened his eyes and prostrated himself humbly before the omnipotent \none.  \n\"'You are now ready for discipleship.' Babaji beamed lovingly on his \nresurrected chela. 'You have courageously passed a difficult test. Death \nshall not touch you again; now you are one of our immortal flock.' Then he \nspoke his usual words of departure, 'Dera danda uthao'; the whole group \nvanished from the mountain.\"  \nAn avatar lives in the omnipresent Spirit; for him there is no distance \ninverse to the square. Only one reason, therefore, can motivate Babaji in \nmaintaining his physical form from century to century: the desire to \nfurnish humanity with a concrete example of its own possibilities. Were \nman never vouchsafed a glimpse of Divinity in the flesh, he would remain \noppressed by the heavy mayic delusion that he cannot transcend his \nmortality.  \nJesus knew from the beginning the sequence of his life; he passed \nthrough each event not for himself, not from any karmic compulsion, but \nsolely for the upliftment of reflective human beings. His four reporter-\ndisciples-Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John-recorded the ineffable drama \nfor the benefit of later generations.  \n"}

Yet, accommodating himself \nto the limited understanding of men, he has played many acts of his divine \nlife in the presence of one or more witnesses. Thus it came about that a \ndisciple of Lahiri Mahasaya was present when Babaji deemed the time to \nbe ripe for him to proclaim the possibility of bodily immortality. He \nuttered this promise before Ram Gopal Muzumdar, that it might finally \nbecome known for the inspiration of other seeking hearts. The great ones \nspeak their words and participate in the seemingly natural course of \nevents, solely for the good of man, even as Christ said: \"Father . . .

The night was bright with moonlight \nand the glittering stars. After I had sat in patient silence for awhile, my \nattention was drawn to a huge stone slab near my feet. It rose gradually, \nrevealing an underground cave. As the stone remained balanced in some \nunknown manner, the draped form of a young and surpassingly lovely \nwoman was levitated from the cave high into the air. Surrounded by a \nsoft halo, she slowly descended in front of me and stood motionless, \nsteeped in an inner state of ecstasy. She finally stirred, and spoke gently.  \n\"'I am Mataji, 33-4 the sister of Babaji. I have asked him and also Lahiri \nMahasaya to come to my cave tonight to discuss a matter of great \nimportance.'  \n\"A nebulous light was rapidly floating over the Ganges; the strange \nluminescence was reflected in the opaque waters. It approached nearer \nand nearer until, with a blinding flash, it appeared by the side of Mataji \nand condensed itself instantly into the human form of Lahiri Mahasaya. \nHe bowed humbly at the feet of the woman saint.  \n\"Before I had recovered from my bewilderment, I was further wonder- \nstruck to behold a circling mass of mystical light traveling in the sky. \n"}

A slight uneasiness beset me at the thought that I \nmight not be able to retrace my steps before darkness had descended \nover the jungle.  \n\"I finally reached a small clearing whose sides were dotted with caves. On \none of the rocky ledges stood a smiling young man, extending his hand in \nwelcome. I noticed with astonishment that, except for his copper-colored \nhair, he bore a remarkable resemblance to myself.  \n\"'Lahiri, you have come!' The saint addressed me affectionately in Hindi. \n'Rest here in this cave. It was I who called you.'  \n\"I entered a neat little grotto which contained several woolen blankets \nand a few kamandulus (begging bowls).  \n"}

The yogi's remark was \nincomprehensible to me; I inquired his meaning.  \n\"'I refer to the telegram that summoned you to these isolated parts. It \nwas I who silently suggested to the mind of your superior officer that \nyou be transferred to Ranikhet. When one feels his unity with mankind, \nall minds become transmitting stations through which he can work at will.' \nHe added gently, 'Lahiri, surely this cave seems familiar to you?'  \n\"As I maintained a bewildered silence, the saint approached and struck \nme gently on the forehead. At his magnetic touch, a wondrous current \nswept through my brain, releasing the sweet seed-memories of my \nprevious life.  \n\"'I remember!' My voice was half-choked with joyous sobs. 'You are my \nguru Babaji, who has belonged to me always! Scenes of the past arise \nvividly in my mind; here in this cave I spent many years of my last \nincarnation!' As ineffable recollections overwhelmed me, I tearfully \nembraced my master's feet.  \n\"'For more than three decades I have waited for you here-waited for you \nto return to me!' Babaji's voice rang with celestial love. 'You slipped away \nand vanished into the tumultuous waves of the life beyond death. The \nmagic wand of your karma touched you, and you were gone! Though you \nlost sight of me, never did I lose sight of you! I pursued you over the \nluminescent astral sea where the glorious angels sail. Through gloom, \nstorm, upheaval, and light I followed you, like a mother bird guarding her \nyoung. As you lived out your human term of womb-life, and emerged a \nbabe, my eye was ever on you.

Please tell me the mystery of its origin.'  \n\"'I will gladly enlighten you.' My companion's dark eyes sparkled with \nwisdom. 'In reality there is nothing inexplicable about this \nmaterialization.

This \ngolden palace, instantaneously created, is real, even as this earth is real. \nBabaji created this palatial mansion out of his mind and is holding its \natoms together by the power of his will, even as God created this earth \nand is maintaining it intact.'

'Our great guru created this palace by \nsolidifying myriads of free cosmic rays,' he went on. 'Touch this vase and \nits diamonds; they will satisfy all the tests of sensory experience.'  \n\"I examined the vase, and passed my hand over the smooth room-walls, \nthick with glistening gold.

A \nsubmerged desire, hidden in my subconsciousness from lives now gone, \nseemed simultaneously gratified and extinguished.  \n\"My stately companion led me through ornate arches and corridors into a \nseries of chambers richly furnished in the style of an emperor's palace. \nWe entered an immense hall. In the center stood a golden throne, \nencrusted with jewels shedding a dazzling medley of colors. There, in \nlotus posture, sat the supreme Babaji. I knelt on the shining floor at his \nfeet.  \n"}

Receive your initiation into the \nkingdom of God through Kriya Yoga.'  \n\"Babaji stretched out his hand; a homa (sacrificial) fire appeared, \nsurrounded by fruits and flowers. I received the liberating yogic \ntechnique before this flaming altar.  \n\"The rites were completed in the early dawn. I felt no need for sleep in \nmy ecstatic state, and wandered around the palace, filled on all sides with \ntreasures and priceless objets d'art. Descending to the gorgeous \ngardens, I noticed, near-by, the same caves and barren mountain ledges \nwhich yesterday had boasted no adjacency to palace or flowered terrace.  \n\"Reentering the palace, fabulously glistening in the cold Himalayan \nsunlight, I sought the presence of my master. He was still enthroned, \nsurrounded by many quiet disciples.  \n\"'Lahiri, you are hungry.' Babaji added, 'Close your eyes.'  \n\"When I reopened them, the enchanting palace and its picturesque \ngardens had disappeared. My own body and the forms of Babaji and the \ncluster of chelas were all now seated on the bare ground at the exact site \nof the vanished palace, not far from the sunlit entrances of the rocky \ngrottos. I recalled that my guide had remarked that the palace would be \ndematerialized, its captive atoms released into the thought- essence \nfrom which it had sprung. Although stunned, I looked trustingly at my \nguru. I knew not what to expect next on this day of miracles.  \n\"'The purpose for which the palace was created has now been served,' \nBabaji explained. He lifted an earthen vessel from the ground. 'Put your \nhand there and receive whatever food you desire.'  \n\"As soon as I touched the broad, empty bowl, it became heaped with hot \nbutter-fried luchis, curry, and rare sweetmeats. I helped myself, \nobserving that the vessel was ever-filled. At the end of my meal I looked \naround for water. My guru pointed to the bowl before me.

I gazed tranquilly \nat the stark contrast of the present scene. The gaunt ground, the skyey \nroof, the caves offering primitive shelter-all seemed a gracious natural \nsetting for the seraphic saints around me.  \n\"I sat that afternoon on my blanket, hallowed by associations of past- life \nrealizations. My divine guru approached and passed his hand over my head. \nI entered the nirbikalpa samadhi state, remaining unbrokenly in its bliss \nfor seven days. Crossing the successive strata of self- knowledge, I \npenetrated the deathless realms of reality. All delusive limitations \ndropped away; my soul was fully established on the eternal altar of the \nCosmic Spirit. On the eighth day I fell at my guru's feet and implored him \nto keep me always near him in this sacred wilderness.  \n\"'My son,' Babaji said, embracing me, 'your role in this incarnation must \nbe played on an outward stage. Prenatally blessed by many lives of lonely \nmeditation, you must now mingle in the world of men.  \n\"'A deep purpose underlay the fact that you did not meet me this time \nuntil you were already a married man, with modest business \nresponsibilities. You must put aside your thoughts of joining our secret \nband in the Himalayas; your life lies in the crowded marts, serving as an \nexample of the ideal yogi-householder.  \n\"'The cries of many bewildered worldly men and women have not fallen \nunheard on the ears of the Great Ones,' he went on. 'You have been \nchosen to bring spiritual solace through Kriya Yoga to numerous earnest \nseekers. The millions who are encumbered by family ties and heavy \nworldly duties will take new heart from you, a householder like \nthemselves. You must guide them to see that the highest yogic \nattainments are not barred to the family man. Even in the world, the yogi \nwho faithfully discharges his responsibilities, without personal motive or \nattachment, treads the sure path of enlightenment.  \n\"'No necessity compels you to leave the world, for inwardly you have \nalready sundered its every karmic tie.

Yet adamantine truth rang in his \nwords; I submissively agreed to leave this blessed haven of peace. Babaji \ninstructed me in the ancient rigid rules which govern the transmission of \nthe yogic art from guru to disciple.  \n\"'Bestow the Kriya key only on qualified chelas,' Babaji said. 'He who vows \nto sacrifice all in the quest of the Divine is fit to unravel the final \nmysteries of life through the science of meditation.'  \n\"'Angelic guru, as you have already favored mankind by resurrecting the \nlost Kriya art, will you not increase that benefit by relaxing the strict \nrequirements for discipleship?' I gazed beseechingly at Babaji. 'I pray \nthat you permit me to communicate Kriya to all seekers, even though at \nfirst they cannot vow themselves to complete inner renunciation. The \ntortured men and women of the world, pursued by the threefold \nsuffering, 34-7 need special encouragement. They may never attempt the \nroad to freedom if Kriya initiation be withheld from them.'  \n\"'Be it so. The divine wish has been expressed through you.' With these \nsimple words, the merciful guru banished the rigorous safeguards that \nfor ages had hidden Kriya from the world. 'Give Kriya freely to all who \nhumbly ask for help.'  \n\"After a silence, Babaji added, 'Repeat to each of your disciples this \nmajestic promise from the Bhagavad Gita: \"Swalpamasya Dharmasya, \nTrayata Mahato Bhoyat\"-\"Even a little bit of the practice of this religion \nwill save you from dire fears and colossal sufferings.\"' 34-8  \n\"As I knelt the next morning at my guru's feet for his farewell blessing, \nhe sensed my deep reluctance to leave him.  \n\"'There is no separation for us, my beloved child.'

Another man should have been sent to \nassume the Ranikhet duties.'  \n\"I smiled, reflecting on the hidden crosscurrents in the events which had \nled me to this furthermost spot of India.  \n\"Before returning to Danapur, I spent a few days with a Bengali family at \nMoradabad. A party of six friends gathered to greet me.

There are numerous passages in the Bible \nwhich infer that John and Jesus in their last incarnations were, \nrespectively, Elijah and his disciple Elisha. (These are the spellings in the \nOld Testament. The Greek translators spelled the names as Elias and \nEliseus; they reappear in the New Testament in these changed forms.)  \nThe very end of the Old Testament is a prediction of the reincarnation of \nElijah and Elisha: \"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the \ncoming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.\" 35-3 Thus John \n(Elijah), sent \"before the coming . . . of the Lord,\" was born slightly \nearlier to serve as a herald for Christ. An angel appeared to Zacharias \nthe father to testify that his coming son John would be no other than \nElijah (Elias).  \n\"But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; \nand thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name \nJohn. . . . And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord \ntheir God. And he shall go before him 35-4 in the spirit and power of Elias, \nto turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to \nthe wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\" \n35-5 Jesus twice unequivocally identified Elijah (Elias) as John: \"Elias is \ncome already, and they knew him not. . . . Then the disciples understood \nthat he spake unto them of John the Baptist.\" 35-6 Again, Christ says: \n\"For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. And if ye will \nreceive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.\" 35-7 When John denied \nthat he was Elias (Elijah), 35-8 he meant that in the humble garb of John \nhe came no longer in the outward elevation of Elijah the great guru. In his \nformer incarnation he had given the \"mantle\" of his glory and his spiritual \nwealth to his disciple Elisha. \"And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double \nportion of thy spirit be upon me. And he said, Thou hast asked a hard \nthing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be \nso unto thee. . . . And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him.\" 35-9  \nThe roles became reversed, because Elijah-John was no longer needed to \nbe the ostensible guru of Elisha-Jesus, now perfected in divine \nrealization.  \nWhen Christ was transfigured on the mountain 35-10 it was his guru Elias, \nwith Moses, whom he saw.

Then, after \ntheir brief meeting near Ranikhet, the selfless master banished his \ndearly-beloved disciple from the little mountain group, releasing him for \nan outward world mission. \"My son, I shall come whenever you need me.\" \nWhat mortal lover can bestow that infinite promise?  \nUnknown to society in general, a great spiritual renaissance began to flow \nfrom a remote corner of Benares. Just as the fragrance of flowers \ncannot be suppressed, so Lahiri Mahasaya, quietly living as an ideal \nhouseholder, could not hide his innate glory. Slowly, from every part of \nIndia, the devotee-bees sought the divine nectar of the liberated master.  \nThe English office superintendent was one of the first to notice a \nstrange transcendental change in his employee, whom he endearingly \ncalled \"Ecstatic Babu.\"  \n\"Sir, you seem sad. What is the trouble?\" Lahiri Mahasaya made this \nsympathetic inquiry one morning to his employer.  \n\"My wife in England is critically ill. I am torn by anxiety.\"  \n\"I shall get you some word about her.\" Lahiri Mahasaya left the room and \nsat for a short time in a secluded spot. On his return he smiled \nconsolingly.  \n\"Your wife is improving; she is now writing you a letter.\" The omniscient \nyogi quoted some parts of the missive.  \n\"Ecstatic Babu, I already know that you are no ordinary man. Yet I am \nunable to believe that, at will, you can banish time and space!\"  \n"}

She visited the office, where \nLahiri Mahasaya was quietly sitting at his desk. The woman approached \nhim reverently.  \n\"Sir,\" she said, \"it was your form, haloed in glorious light, that I beheld \nmonths ago by my sickbed in London. At that moment I was completely \nhealed! Soon after, I was able to undertake the long ocean voyage to \nIndia.\"  \nDay after day, one or two devotees besought the sublime guru for Kriya \ninitiation. In addition to these spiritual duties, and to those of his \nbusiness and family life, the great master took an enthusiastic interest in \neducation. He organized many study groups, and played an active part in \nthe growth of a large high school in the Bengalitola section of Benares. \nHis regular discourses on the scriptures came to be called his \"Gita \nAssembly,\" eagerly attended by many truth-seekers.  \nBy these manifold activities, Lahiri Mahasaya sought to answer the \ncommon challenge: \"After performing one's business and social duties, \nwhere is the time for devotional meditation?\" The harmoniously balanced \nlife of the great householder-guru became the silent inspiration of \nthousands of questioning hearts. Earning only a modest salary, thrifty, \nunostentatious, accessible to all, the master carried on naturally and \nhappily in the path of worldly life.  \nThough ensconced in the seat of the Supreme One, Lahiri Mahasaya \nshowed reverence to all men, irrespective of their differing merits. When \nhis devotees saluted him, he bowed in turn to them. With a childlike \nhumility, the master often touched the feet of others, but seldom \nallowed them to pay him similar honor, even though such obeisance toward \nthe guru is an ancient Oriental custom.  \nA significant feature of Lahiri Mahasaya's life was his gift of Kriya \ninitiation to those of every faith. Not Hindus only, but Moslems and \nChristians were among his foremost disciples. Monists and dualists, those \nof all faiths or of no established faith, were impartially received and \ninstructed by the universal guru.

A \nChristian should go down on his knees four times daily, praying to God and \nthen reading the Bible.\"  \nWith wise discernment the guru guided his followers into the paths of \nBhakti (devotion), Karma (action), Jnana (wisdom), or Raja (royal or \ncomplete) Yogas, according to each man's natural tendencies. The master, \nwho was slow to give his permission to devotees wishing to enter the \nformal path of monkhood, always cautioned them to first reflect well on \nthe austerities of the monastic life.  \nThe great guru taught his disciples to avoid theoretical discussion of the \nscriptures. \"He only is wise who devotes himself to realizing, not reading \nonly, the ancient revelations,\" he said. \"Solve all your problems through \nmeditation. 35-14 Exchange unprofitable religious speculations for actual \nGod-contact.

For a time \nLahiri Mahasaya served as private tutor to the son of Maharaja Iswari \nNarayan Sinha Bahadur of Benares. Recognizing the master's spiritual \nattainment, the maharaja, as well as his son, sought Kriya initiation, as did \nthe Maharaja Jotindra Mohan Thakur.  \nA number of Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples with influential worldly position \nwere desirous of expanding the Kriya circle by publicity. The guru \nrefused his permission. One chela, the royal physician to the Lord of \nBenares, started an organized effort to spread the master's name as \n\"Kashi Baba\" (Exalted One of Benares). 35-16 Again the guru forbade it.  \n\"Let the fragrance of the Kriya flower be wafted naturally, without any \ndisplay,\" he said. \"Its seeds will take root in the soil of spiritually fertile \nhearts.\"  \nAlthough the great master did not adopt the system of preaching \nthrough the modern medium of an organization, or through the printing \npress, he knew that the power of his message would rise like a resistless \nflood, inundating by its own force the banks of human minds.

No longer a mere unintelligible jugglery \nof words, the otherwise unmeaning formulas of Vedic worship have been \nproved by the master to be full of scientific significance. . . .  \n\"We know that man is usually helpless against the insurgent sway of evil \npassions, but these are rendered powerless and man finds no motive in \ntheir indulgence when there dawns on him a consciousness of superior and \nlasting bliss through Kriya. Here the give-up, the negation of the lower \npassions, synchronizes with a take-up, the assertion of a beatitude. \nWithout such a course, hundreds of moral maxims which run in mere \nnegatives are useless to us.  \n\"Our eagerness for worldly activity kills in us the sense of spiritual awe. \nWe cannot comprehend the Great Life behind all names and forms, just \nbecause science brings home to us how we can use the powers of nature; \nthis familiarity has bred a contempt for her ultimate secrets.

We tease her, so to \nspeak, to know how she can be used to serve our purposes; we make use of \nher energies, whose Source yet remains unknown. In science our relation \nwith nature is one that exists between a man and his servant, or in a \nphilosophical sense she is like a captive in the witness box. We cross-\nexamine her, challenge her, and minutely weigh her evidence in human \nscales which cannot measure her hidden values. On the other hand, when \nthe self is in communion with a higher power, nature automatically obeys, \nwithout stress or strain, the will of man. This effortless command over \nnature is called 'miraculous' by the uncomprehending materialist.  \n\"The life of Lahiri Mahasaya set an example which changed the erroneous \nnotion that yoga is a mysterious practice. Every man may find a way \nthrough Kriya to understand his proper relation with nature, and to feel \nspiritual reverence for all phenomena, whether mystical or of everyday \noccurrence, in spite of the matter-of-factness of physical science. 35-21 \nWe must bear in mind that what was mystical a thousand years ago is no \nlonger so, and what is mysterious now may become lawfully intelligible a \n"}

Feeling reluctantly that the parting-hour had arrived, I \nrose from my leafy seat.  \n\"'Do you know Lahiri?' 36-3 the master inquired. 'He is a great soul, isn't \nhe? Tell him of our meeting.' He then gave me a message for Lahiri \nMahasaya.  \n\"After I had bowed humbly in farewell, the saint smiled benignly. 'When \nyour book is finished, I shall pay you a visit,' he promised.

'I see you couldn't, for he prevented you. He is my \nincomparable guru, the celestial Babaji!'  \n\"'Babaji!' I repeated, awestruck. 'The Yogi-Christ Babaji! The invisible-\nvisible savior Babaji!

This was \na wrath of love, of course, and nothing more.  \n\"A few months later I visited Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares.

Sanatan Dharma has come to be called Hinduism since the time \nof the Greeks who designated the people on the banks of the river Indus \nas Indoos, or Hindus. The word Hindu, properly speaking, refers only to \nfollowers of Sanatan Dharma or Hinduism. The term Indian applies equally \nto Hindus and Mohammedans and other inhabitants of the soil of India \n(and also through the confusing geographical error of Columbus, to the \nAmerican Mongoloid aboriginals).  \nThe ancient name for India is Aryavarta, literally, \"abode of the Aryans.\" \nThe Sanskrit root of arya is \"worthy, holy, noble.\" The later ethnological \nmisuse of Aryan to signify not spiritual, but physical, characteristics, led \nthe great Orientalist, Max Muller, to say quaintly: \"To me an ethnologist \nwho speaks of an Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as \ngreat a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a \nbrachycephalic grammar.\"  \n36-5: param-guru is literally \"guru supreme\" or \"guru beyond,\" signifying a \nline or succession of teachers.

In a few more days he would have reached his sixty-eighth \nbirthday.  \n36-8: Facing the north, and thrice revolving the body, are parts of a \nVedic rite used by masters who know beforehand when the final hour is \nabout to strike for the physical body.

I \nhad heard many stories about the materialistic Western atmosphere, one \nvery different from the spiritual background of India, pervaded with the \ncenturied aura of saints. \"An Oriental teacher who will dare the Western \nairs,\" I thought, \"must be hardy beyond the trials of any Himalayan cold!\"  \nOne early morning I began to pray, with an adamant determination to \ncontinue, to even die praying, until I heard the voice of God.

He came in, closed the door behind him and, refusing my \nrequest to sit down, indicated with a gesture that he wished to talk to me \nwhile standing.  \n\"He must be Babaji!\" I thought, dazed, because the man before me had \nthe features of a younger Lahiri Mahasaya.  \nHe answered my thought. \"Yes, I am Babaji.\" He spoke melodiously in \nHindi. \"Our Heavenly Father has heard your prayer. He commands me to \ntell you: Follow the behests of your guru and go to America. Fear not; you \nwill be protected.\"  \nAfter a vibrant pause, Babaji addressed me again. \"You are the one I have \nchosen to spread the message of Kriya Yoga in the West. Long ago I met \nyour guru Yukteswar at a Kumbha Mela; I told him then I would send you \nto him for training.\"  \nI was speechless, choked with devotional awe at his presence, and deeply \ntouched to hear from his own lips that he had guided me to Sri \nYukteswar. I lay prostrate before the deathless guru. He graciously \nlifted me from the floor.

In a short while he started toward the door.  \n\"Do not try to follow me,\" he said. \"You will not be able to do so.\"  \n\"Please, Babaji, don't go away!\" I cried repeatedly. \"Take me with you!\"  \nLooking back, he replied, \"Not now.

By \ndiscreet inquiry I learned from a number of passengers: \"You gave an \ninspiring lecture in stirring and correct English.\" At this delightful news I \nhumbly thanked my guru for his timely help, realizing anew that he was \never with me, setting at naught all barriers of time and space.  \nOnce in awhile, during the remainder of the ocean trip, I experienced a \nfew apprehensive twinges about the coming English-lecture ordeal at the \nBoston congress.  \n\"Lord,\" I prayed, \"please let my inspiration be Thyself, and not again the \nlaughter-bombs of the audience!\"  \nThe City Of Sparta docked near Boston in late September. On the sixth \nof October I addressed the congress with my maiden speech in America. \nIt was well received; I sighed in relief.

Therese entered immediately, radiating an aura of peace and \njoy. She wore a black gown and spotless white head dress. Although her \nage was thirty-seven at this time, she seemed much younger, possessing \nindeed a childlike freshness and charm. Healthy, well- formed, rosy-\ncheeked, and cheerful, this is the saint that does not eat!  \nTherese greeted me with a very gentle handshaking. We both beamed in \nsilent communion, each knowing the other to be a lover of God.  \nDr. Wurz kindly offered to serve as interpreter. As we seated ourselves, \nI noticed that Therese was glancing at me with naive curiosity; evidently \nHindus had been rare in Bavaria.  \n\"Don't you eat anything?\" I wanted to hear the answer from her own lips.  \n\"No, except a consecrated rice-flour wafer, once every morning at six \no'clock.\"  \n\"How large is the wafer?\"  \n\"It is paper-thin, the size of a small coin.\" She added, \"I take it for \nsacramental reasons; if it is unconsecrated, I am unable to swallow it.\"  \n\"Certainly you could not have lived on that, for twelve whole years?\"  \n\"I live by God's light.\" How simple her reply, how Einsteinian!  \n\"I see you realize that energy flows to your body from the ether, sun, \nand air.\"  \nA swift smile broke over her face. \"I am so happy to know you understand \nhow I live.\"  \n\"Your sacred life is a daily demonstration of the truth uttered by Christ: \n'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out \nof the mouth of God.'\" 39-3  \n"}

One of the \nreasons I am here on earth today is to prove that man can live by God's \ninvisible light, and not by food only.\"  \n\"Can you teach others how to live without food?\"  \nShe appeared a trifle shocked. \"I cannot do that; God does not wish it.\"  \nAs my gaze fell on her strong, graceful hands, Therese showed me a \nlittle, square, freshly healed wound on each of her palms. On the back of \neach hand, she pointed out a smaller, crescent-shaped wound, freshly \nhealed. Each wound went straight through the hand. The sight brought to \nmy mind distinct recollection of the large square iron nails with crescent-\ntipped ends, still used in the Orient, but which I do not recall having seen \nin the West.  \nThe saint told me something of her weekly trances. \"As a helpless \nonlooker, I observe the whole Passion of Christ.\" Each week, from \nThursday midnight until Friday afternoon at one o'clock, her wounds open \nand bleed; she loses ten pounds of her ordinary 121-pound weight. \nSuffering intensely in her sympathetic love, Therese yet looks forward \njoyously to these weekly visions of her Lord.  \nI realized at once that her strange life is intended by God to reassure all \nChristians of the historical authenticity of Jesus' life and crucifixion as \nrecorded in the New Testament, and to dramatically display the ever-\nliving bond between the Galilean Master and his devotees.  \nProfessor Wurz related some of his experiences with the saint.  \n\"Several of us, including Therese, often travel for days on sight- seeing \ntrips throughout Germany,\" he told me. \"It is a striking contrast-while we \nhave three meals a day, Therese eats nothing. She remains as fresh as a \nrose, untouched by the fatigue which the trips cause us. As we grow \nhungry and hunt for wayside inns, she laughs merrily.\"  \nThe professor added some interesting physiological details: \"Because \nTherese takes no food, her stomach has shrunk. She has no excretions, \nbut her perspiration glands function; her skin is always soft and firm.\"  \nAt the time of parting, I expressed to Therese my desire to be present \nat her trance.  \n"}

I am very happy you sought me out in \nEichstatt.\"  \nTherese shook hands gently, many times, and walked with our party to the \ngate. Mr. Wright turned on the automobile radio; the saint examined it \nwith little enthusiastic chuckles. Such a large crowd of youngsters \ngathered that Therese retreated into the house. We saw her at a \nwindow, where she peered at us, childlike, waving her hand.  \nFrom a conversation the next day with two of Therese's brothers, very \nkind and amiable, we learned that the saint sleeps only one or two hours \nat night. In spite of the many wounds in her body, she is active and full of \nenergy. She loves birds, looks after an aquarium of fish, and works often \nin her garden. Her correspondence is large; Catholic devotees write her \nfor prayers and healing blessings. Many seekers have been cured through \nher of serious diseases.  \nHer brother Ferdinand, about twenty-three, explained that Therese has \nthe power, through prayer, of working out on her own body the ailments \nof others. The saint's abstinence from food dates from a time when she \nprayed that the throat disease of a young man of her parish, then \npreparing to enter holy orders, be transferred to her own throat.  \nOn Thursday afternoon our party drove to the home of the bishop, who \nlooked at my flowing locks with some surprise. He readily wrote out the \nnecessary permit. There was no fee; the rule made by the Church is \nsimply to protect Therese from the onrush of casual tourists, who in \nprevious years had flocked on Fridays by the thousands.  \nWe arrived Friday morning about nine-thirty in Konnersreuth. I noticed \nthat Therese's little cottage possesses a special glass-roofed section to \nafford her plenty of light. We were glad to see the doors no longer \nclosed, but wide-open in hospitable cheer. There was a line of about \ntwenty visitors, armed with their permits. Many had come from great \ndistances to view the mystic trance.  \nTherese had passed my first test at the professor's house by her \nintuitive knowledge that I wanted to see her for spiritual reasons, and \nnot just to satisfy a passing curiosity.  \n"}

The \nwhite garment was redly splotched over her heart from the wound in her \nside at the spot where Christ's body, long ages ago, had suffered the \nfinal indignity of the soldier's spear-thrust.  \nTherese's hands were extended in a gesture maternal, pleading; her face \nwore an expression both tortured and divine. She appeared thinner, \nchanged in many subtle as well as outward ways.

The vision disappeared. In the \nexhaustion of fervid pity, Therese sank heavily against her pillow.  \nAt this moment I heard a loud thud behind me. Turning my head for a \nsecond, I saw two men carrying out a prostrate body. But because I was \ncoming out of the deep superconscious state, I did not immediately \nrecognize the fallen person. Again I fixed my eyes on Therese's face, \ndeathly pale under the rivulets of blood, but now calm, radiating purity \nand holiness.

Very \nlittle time was given to sight-seeing, however; I was impatient, eager to \nsee my beloved guru and other dear ones.

A sudden left turn, and there before us towered the simple but \ninspiring two-story ashram, its Spanish-style balcony jutting from the \nupper floor. The pervasive impression was that of peaceful solitude.  \n\"In grave humility I walked behind Yoganandaji into the courtyard within \nthe hermitage walls. Hearts beating fast, we proceeded up some old \ncement steps, trod, no doubt, by myriads of truth-seekers. The tension \ngrew keener and keener as on we strode. Before us, near the head of the \nstairs, quietly appeared the Great One, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, standing \nin the noble pose of a sage.  \n\"My heart heaved and swelled as I felt myself blessed by the privilege of \nbeing in his sublime presence. Tears blurred my eager sight when \nYoganandaji dropped to his knees, and with bowed head offered his soul's \ngratitude and greeting, touching with his hand his guru's feet and then, in \nhumble obeisance, his own head. He rose then and was embraced on both \nsides of the bosom by Sri Yukteswarji.  \n\"No words passed at the beginning, but the most intense feeling was \nexpressed in the mute phrases of the soul. How their eyes sparkled and \nwere fired with the warmth of renewed soul-union! A tender vibration \nsurged through the quiet patio, and even the sun eluded the clouds to add \na sudden blaze of glory.  \n\"On bended knee before the master I gave my own unexpressed love and \nthanks, touching his feet, calloused by time and service, and receiving his \nblessing. I stood then and faced two beautiful deep eyes smouldering with \nintrospection, yet radiant with joy. We entered his sitting room, whose \nwhole side opened to the outer balcony first seen from the street. The \nmaster braced himself against a worn davenport, sitting on a covered \nmattress on the cement floor. Yoganandaji and I sat near the guru's feet, \nwith orange-colored pillows to lean against and ease our positions on the \nstraw mat.  \n"}

But I perceived the saintliness of the \nGreat One through his heart-warming smile and twinkling eyes. One \nquality easily discernible in his merry, serious conversation is a decided \npositiveness in statement-the mark of a wise man, who knows he knows, \nbecause he knows God. His great wisdom, strength of purpose, and \ndetermination are apparent in every way.  \n\"Studying him reverently from time to time, I noted that he is of large, \nathletic stature, hardened by the trials and sacrifices of renunciation. \nHis poise is majestic. A decidedly sloping forehead, as if seeking the \nheavens, dominates his divine countenance. He has a rather large and \nhomely nose, with which he amuses himself in idle moments, flipping and \nwiggling it with his fingers, like a child. His powerful dark eyes are haloed \nby an ethereal blue ring. His hair, parted in the middle, begins as silver \nand changes to streaks of silvery-gold and silvery-black, ending in ringlets \nat his shoulders. His beard and moustache are scant or thinned out, yet \nseem to enhance his features and, like his character, are deep and light \nat the same time.  \n\"He has a jovial and rollicking laugh which comes from deep in his chest, \ncausing him to shake and quiver throughout his body-very cheerful and \nsincere. His face and stature are striking in their power, as are his \nmuscular fingers. He moves with a dignified tread and erect posture.  \n\"He was clad simply in the common dhoti and shirt, both once dyed a \nstrong ocher color, but now a faded orange.  \n\"Glancing about, I observed that this rather dilapidated room suggested \nthe owner's non-attachment to material comforts. The weather-stained \nwhite walls of the long chamber were streaked with fading blue plaster. \nAt one end of the room hung a picture of Lahiri Mahasaya, garlanded in \nsimple devotion. There was also an old picture showing Yoganandaji as he \nhad first arrived in Boston, standing with the other delegates to the \nCongress of Religions.  \n\"I noted a quaint concurrence of modernity and antiquation.

Beyond the balcony I could \nsee coconut trees towering over the hermitage in silent protection.  \n\"It is interesting to observe that the master has merely to clap his hands \ntogether and, before finishing, he is served or attended by some small \ndisciple. Incidentally, I am much attracted to one of them-a thin lad, \nnamed Prafulla, 40-2 with long black hair to his shoulders, a most \npenetrating pair of sparkling black eyes, and a heavenly smile; his eyes \ntwinkle, as the corners of his mouth rise, like the stars and the crescent \nmoon appearing at twilight.  \n\"Swami Sri Yukteswarji's joy is obviously intense at the return of his \n'product' (and he seems to be somewhat inquisitive about the 'product's \nproduct'). However, predominance of the wisdom-aspect in the Great \nOne's nature hinders his outward expression of feeling.  \n\"Yoganandaji presented him with some gifts, as is the custom when the \ndisciple returns to his guru. We sat down later to a simple but well- \ncooked meal. All the dishes were vegetable and rice combinations. Sri \nYukteswarji was pleased at my use of a number of Indian customs, \n'finger-eating' for example.  \n\"After several hours of flying Bengali phrases and the exchange of warm \nsmiles and joyful glances, we paid obeisance at his feet, bade adieu with a \npronam, 40-3 and departed for Calcutta with an everlasting memory of a \nsacred meeting and greeting. Although I write chiefly of my external \nimpressions of him, yet I was always conscious of the true basis of the \nsaint-his spiritual glory. I felt his power, and shall carry that feeling as \nmy divine blessing.\"  \nFrom America, Europe, and Palestine I had brought many presents for Sri \nYukteswar. He received them smilingly, but without remark. For my own \nuse, I had bought in Germany a combination umbrella-cane. In India I \ndecided to give the cane to Master.  \n\"This gift I appreciate indeed!\" My guru's eyes were turned on me with \naffectionate understanding as he made the unwonted comment. From all \nthe presents, it was the cane that he singled out to display to visitors.  \n\"Master, please permit me to get a new carpet for the sitting room.\" I \nhad noticed that Sri Yukteswar's tiger skin was placed over a torn rug.  \n"}

What a welcome there, a veritable \novation! Tears stood in my eyes as I embraced the selfless teachers who \nhad kept the banner of the school flying during my fifteen years' \nabsence. The bright faces and happy smiles of the residential and day \nstudents were ample testimony to the worth of their many-sided school \nand yoga training.  \nYet, alas! the Ranchi institution was in dire financial difficulties. Sir \nManindra Chandra Nundy, the old Maharaja whose Kasimbazar Palace had \nbeen converted into the central school building, and who had made many \nprincely donations was now dead. Many free, benevolent features of the \nschool were now seriously endangered for lack of sufficient public \nsupport.  \nI had not spent years in America without learning some of its practical \nwisdom, its undaunted spirit before obstacles. For one week I remained in \nRanchi, wrestling with critical problems. Then came interviews in Calcutta \nwith prominent leaders and educators, a long talk with the young \nMaharaja of Kasimbazar, a financial appeal to my father, and lo! the shaky \nfoundations of Ranchi began to be righted. Many donations including one \nhuge check arrived in the nick of time from my American students.  \nWithin a few months after my arrival in India, I had the joy of seeing the \nRanchi school legally incorporated. My lifelong dream of a permanently \nendowed yoga educational center stood fulfilled. That vision had guided \nme in the humble beginnings in 1917 with a group of seven boys.  \nIn the decade since 1935, Ranchi has enlarged its scope far beyond the \nboys' school. Widespread humanitarian activities are now carried on \nthere in the Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya Mission.  \nThe school, or Yogoda Sat-Sanga Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, conducts \noutdoor classes in grammar and high school subjects. The residential \nstudents and day scholars also receive vocational training of some kind. \n"}

Very early in my career as an educator I \ndiscovered that boys who impishly delight in outwitting a teacher will \ncheerfully accept disciplinary rules that are set by their fellow students. \nNever a model pupil myself, I had a ready sympathy for all boyish pranks \nand problems.  \nSports and games are encouraged; the fields resound with hockey and \nfootball practice. Ranchi students often win the cup at competitive \nevents. The outdoor gymnasium is known far and wide. Muscle recharging \nthrough will power is the Yogoda feature: mental direction of life energy \nto any part of the body. The boys are also taught asanas (postures), \nsword and lathi (stick) play, and jujitsu. The Yogoda Health Exhibitions at \nthe Ranchi Vidyalaya have been attended by thousands.  \nInstruction in primary subjects is given in Hindi to the Kols, Santals, and \nMundas, aboriginal tribes of the province. Classes for girls only have been \norganized in near-by villages.  \nThe unique feature at Ranchi is the initiation into Kriya Yoga. The boys \ndaily practice their spiritual exercises, engage in Gita chanting, and are \ntaught by precept and example the virtues of simplicity, self-sacrifice, \nhonor, and truth. Evil is pointed out to them as being that which produces \nmisery; good as those actions which result in true happiness. Evil may be \ncompared to poisoned honey, tempting but laden with death.  \nOvercoming restlessness of body and mind by concentration techniques \nhas achieved astonishing results: it is no novelty at Ranchi to see an \nappealing little figure, aged nine or ten years, sitting for an hour or more \nin unbroken poise, the unwinking gaze directed to the spiritual eye. Often \nthe picture of these Ranchi students has returned to my mind, as I \nobserved collegians over the world who are hardly able to sit still through \none class period. 40-4  \nRanchi lies 2000 feet above sea level; the climate is mild and equable. The \ntwenty-five acre site, by a large bathing pond, includes one of the finest \norchards in India-five hundred fruit trees-mango, guava, litchi, jackfruit, \ndate. The boys grow their own vegetables, and spin at their charkas.  \nA guest house is hospitably open for Western visitors.

The Ranchi students are trained in first aid, and \nhave given praiseworthy service to their province at tragic times of flood \nor famine.  \nIn the orchard stands a Shiva temple, with a statue of the blessed \nmaster, Lahiri Mahasaya. Daily prayers and scripture classes are held in \nthe garden under the mango bowers.  \nBranch high schools, with the residential and yoga features of Ranchi, \nhave been opened and are now flourishing. These are the Yogoda Sat- \nSanga Vidyapith (School) for Boys, at Lakshmanpur in Bihar; and the \nYogoda Sat-Sanga High School and hermitage at Ejmalichak in Midnapore.  \nA stately Yogoda Math was dedicated in 1939 at Dakshineswar, directly \non the Ganges. Only a few miles north of Calcutta, the new hermitage \naffords a haven of peace for city dwellers. Suitable accommodations are \navailable for Western guests, and particularly for those seekers who are \nintensely dedicating their lives to spiritual realization. The activities of \nthe Yogoda Math include a fortnightly mailing of Self- Realization \nFellowship teachings to students in various parts of India.  \nIt is needless to say that all these educational and humanitarian activities \nhave required the self-sacrificing service and devotion of many teachers \nand workers. I do not list their names here, because they are so \nnumerous; but in my heart each one has a lustrous niche. Inspired by the \nideals of Lahiri Mahasaya, these teachers have abandoned promising \nworldly goals to serve humbly, to give greatly.  \nMr. Wright formed many fast friendships with Ranchi boys; clad in a \nsimple dhoti, he lived for awhile among them. At Ranchi, Calcutta, \nSerampore, everywhere he went, my secretary, who has a vivid gift of \ndescription, hauled out his travel diary to record his adventures.

That youth of colors is lost when man tries to \nimitate with mere pigments, for the Lord resorts to a more simple and \neffective medium-oils that are neither oils nor pigments, but mere rays \nof light. He tosses a splash of light here, and it reflects red; He waves \nthe brush again and it blends gradually into orange and gold; then with a \npiercing thrust He stabs the clouds with a streak of purple that leaves a \nringlet or fringe of red oozing out of the wound in the clouds; and so, on \nand on, He plays, night and morning alike, ever-changing, ever-new, ever-\nfresh; no patterns, no duplicates, no colors just the same.

To the north of Mysore is the \nlargest native state in India, Hyderabad, a picturesque plateau cut by the \nmighty Godavari River. Broad fertile plains, the lovely Nilgiris or \"Blue \nMountains,\" other regions with barren hills of limestone or granite. \nHyderabad history is a long, colorful story, starting three thousand years \nago under the Andhra kings, and continuing under Hindu dynasties until \nA.D. 1294, when it passed to a line of Moslem rulers who reign to this day.  \nThe most breath-taking display of architecture, sculpture, and painting in \nall India is found at Hyderabad in the ancient rock- sculptured caves of \nEllora and Ajanta. The Kailasa at Ellora, a huge monolithic temple, \npossesses carved figures of gods, men, and beasts in the stupendous \nproportions of a Michelangelo. Ajanta is the site of five cathedrals and \ntwenty-five monasteries, all rock excavations maintained by tremendous \nfrescoed pillars on which artists and sculptors have immortalized their \ngenius.  \nHyderabad City is graced by the Osmania University and by the imposing \nMecca Masjid Mosque, where ten thousand Mohammedans may assemble \nfor prayer.  \nMysore State too is a scenic wonderland, three thousand feet above sea \nlevel, abounding in dense tropical forests, the home of wild elephants, \nbison, bears, panthers, and tigers. Its two chief cities, Bangalore and \nMysore, are clean, attractive, with many parks and public gardens.  \nHindu architecture and sculpture achieved their highest perfection in \nMysore under the patronage of Hindu kings from the eleventh to the \nfifteenth centuries. The temple at Belur, an eleventh-century \nmasterpiece completed during the reign of King Vishnuvardhana, is \nunsurpassed in the world for its delicacy of detail and exuberant imagery.  \nThe rock pillars found in northern Mysore date from the third century \nB.C., illuminating the memory of King Asoka. He succeeded to the throne \nof the Maurya dynasty then prevailing; his empire included nearly all of \nmodern India, Afghanistan, and Baluchistan. This illustrious emperor, \nconsidered even by Western historians to have been an incomparable \nruler, has left the following wisdom on a rock memorial:  \n"}

A larger Sadasiva \nshrine at Nerur, erected by the Raja of Pudukkottai, is a pilgrimage spot \nwhich has witnessed numerous divine healings.  \nMany quaint stories of Sadasiva, a lovable and fully-illumined master, are \nstill current among the South Indian villagers. Immersed one day in \nsamadhi on the bank of the Kaveri River, Sadasiva was seen to be carried \naway by a sudden flood. Weeks later he was found buried deep beneath a \nmound of earth. As the villagers' shovels struck his body, the saint rose \nand walked briskly away.  \nSadasiva never spoke a word or wore a cloth. One morning the nude yogi \nunceremoniously entered the tent of a Mohammedan chieftain. His ladies \nscreamed in alarm; the warrior dealt a savage sword thrust at Sadasiva, \nwhose arm was severed. The master departed unconcernedly. Overcome \nby remorse, the Mohammedan picked up the arm from the floor and \nfollowed Sadasiva. The yogi quietly inserted his arm into the bleeding \n"}

The yogi indicated to \nthe little ones that they should touch his body. Lo! instantly the whole \ngroup was transported to Madura. The children wandered happily among \nthe thousands of pilgrims. In a few hours the yogi brought his small \ncharges home by his simple mode of transportation. The astonished \nparents heard the vivid tales of the procession of images, and noted that \nseveral children were carrying bags of Madura sweets.  \nAn incredulous youth derided the saint and the story. The following \nmorning he approached Sadasiva.  \n\"Master,\" he said scornfully, \"why don't you take me to the festival, even \nas you did yesterday for the other children?\"  \nSadasiva complied; the boy immediately found himself among the distant \ncity throng. But alas! where was the saint when the youth wanted to \nleave?

Riding over a bridge of the Jumna River, \nwe enjoyed a magnificent view of the skyline of Brindaban just as the sun \nset fire to the sky-a veritable furnace of Vulcan in color, reflected below \nus in the still waters.  \nThe Jumna beach is hallowed by memories of the child Sri Krishna.

The life of Lord Krishna has been \nmisunderstood by many Western commentators. Scriptural allegory is \nbaffling to literal minds. A hilarious blunder by a translator will illustrate \nthis point. The story concerns an inspired medieval saint, the cobbler \nRavidas, who sang in the simple terms of his own trade of the spiritual \nglory hidden in all mankind:  \n  Under the vast vault of blue \n  Lives the divinity clothed in hide. \n"}

One of Ravidas' \nexalted chelas was the Rani of Chitor. She invited a large number of \nBrahmins to a feast in honor of her teacher, but they refused to eat with \na lowly cobbler. As they sat down in dignified aloofness to eat their own \nuncontaminated meal, lo! each Brahmin found at his side the form of \nRavidas.

Eager to see Sri \nYukteswar, I was disappointed to hear that he had left Serampore and \nwas now in Puri, about three hundred miles to the south.  \n\"Come to Puri ashram at once.\" This telegram was sent on March 8th by a \nbrother disciple to Atul Chandra Roy Chowdhry, one of Master's chelas in \nCalcutta. News of the message reached my ears; anguished at its \nimplications, I dropped to my knees and implored God that my guru's life \nbe spared. As I was about to leave Father's home for the train, a divine \nvoice spoke within.  \n\"Do not go to Puri tonight. Thy prayer cannot he granted.\"  \n\"Lord,\" I said, grief-stricken, \"Thou dost not wish to engage with me in a \n'tug of war' at Puri, where Thou wilt have to deny my incessant prayers \nfor Master's life.

Seething \nwith rebellion, my soul was like a volcano. By the time I reached the Puri \nhermitage I was nearing collapse. The inner voice was tenderly repeating: \n\"Collect yourself. Be calm.\"  \nI entered the ashram room where Master's body, unimaginably lifelike, \nwas sitting in the lotus posture-a picture of health and loveliness. A short \ntime before his passing, my guru had been slightly ill with fever, but \nbefore the day of his ascension into the Infinite, his body had become \ncompletely well. No matter how often I looked at his dear form I could \nnot realize that its life had departed. His skin was smooth and soft; in his \nface was a beatific expression of tranquillity. He had consciously \nrelinquished his body at the hour of mystic summoning.  \n\"The Lion of Bengal is gone!\" I cried in a daze.  \nI conducted the solemn rites on March 10th. Sri Yukteswar was buried 42-\n12 with the ancient rituals of the swamis in the garden of his Puri ashram. \nHis disciples later arrived from far and near to honor their guru at a \nvernal equinox memorial service.

Moment of \nmoments! The anguish of past months was toll I counted weightless \nagainst the torrential bliss now descending.  \n\"Master mine, beloved of my heart, why did you leave me?\" I was \nincoherent in an excess of joy. \"Why did you let me go to the Kumbha \nMela? How bitterly have I blamed myself for leaving you!\"  \n"}

Treasure beyond all treasures, my guru who had \nlaughed at death to reach me!  \n\"There are many astral planets, teeming with astral beings,\" Master \nbegan. \"The inhabitants use astral planes, or masses of light, to travel \nfrom one planet to another, faster than electricity and radioactive \nenergies.  \n\"The astral universe, made of various subtle vibrations of light and color, \nis hundreds of times larger than the material cosmos. The entire physical \ncreation hangs like a little solid basket under the huge luminous balloon of \nthe astral sphere. Just as many physical suns and stars roam in space, so \nthere are also countless astral solar and stellar systems. Their planets \nhave astral suns and moons, more beautiful than the physical ones. The \nastral luminaries resemble the aurora borealis-the sunny astral aurora \nbeing more dazzling than the mild-rayed moon-aurora. The astral day and \nnight are longer than those of earth.  \n\"The astral world is infinitely beautiful, clean, pure, and orderly. There \nare no dead planets or barren lands. The terrestrial blemishes- weeds, \nbacteria, insects, snakes-are absent. Unlike the variable climates and \nseasons of the earth, the astral planets maintain the even temperature of \nan eternal spring, with occasional luminous white snow and rain of many-\ncolored lights. Astral planets abound in opal lakes and bright seas and \nrainbow rivers.  \n\"The ordinary astral universe-not the subtler astral heaven of \nHiranyaloka-is peopled with millions of astral beings who have come, more \nor less recently, from the earth, and also with myriads of fairies, \nmermaids, fishes, animals, goblins, gnomes, demigods and spirits, all \nresiding on different astral planets in accordance with karmic \nqualifications. Various spheric mansions or vibratory regions are provided \nfor good and evil spirits. Good ones can travel freely, but the evil spirits \nare confined to limited zones. In the same way that human beings live on \nthe surface of the earth, worms inside the soil, fish in water, and birds in \nair, so astral beings of different grades are assigned to suitable \nvibratory quarters.  \n"}

The astral cosmos is more naturally attuned than the earth to \nthe divine will and plan of perfection. Every astral object is manifested \nprimarily by the will of God, and partially by the will- call of astral beings. \nThey possess the power of modifying or enhancing the grace and form of \nanything already created by the Lord. He has given His astral children \nthe freedom and privilege of changing or improving at will the astral \ncosmos. On earth a solid must be transformed into liquid or other form \nthrough natural or chemical processes, but astral solids are changed into \nastral liquids, gases, or energy solely and instantly by the will of the \ninhabitants.  \n\"The earth is dark with warfare and murder in the sea, land, and air,\" my \nguru continued, \"but the astral realms know a happy harmony and equality. \nAstral beings dematerialize or materialize their forms at will. Flowers or \nfish or animals can metamorphose themselves, for a time, into astral men. \nAll astral beings are free to assume any form, and can easily commune \ntogether. No fixed, definite, natural law hems them round-any astral \ntree, for example, can be successfully asked to produce an astral mango \nor other desired fruit, flower, or indeed any other object. Certain karmic \nrestrictions are present, but there are no distinctions in the astral world \nabout desirability of various forms. Everything is vibrant with God's \ncreative light.  \n\"No one is born of woman; offspring are materialized by astral beings \nthrough the help of their cosmic will into specially patterned, astrally \ncondensed forms. The recently physically disembodied being arrives in an \nastral family through invitation, drawn by similar mental and spiritual \ntendencies.  \n\"The astral body is not subject to cold or heat or other natural \nconditions. The anatomy includes an astral brain, or the thousand- petaled \nlotus of light, and six awakened centers in the sushumna, or astral \ncerebro-spinal axis. The heart draws cosmic energy as well as light from \nthe astral brain, and pumps it to the astral nerves and body cells, or \nlifetrons. Astral beings can affect their bodies by lifetronic force or by \nmantric vibrations.  \n"}

They are able to hear through the eyes or \ntongue, and can taste through the ears or skin, and so forth. 43-4  \n\"Man's physical body is exposed to countless dangers, and is easily hurt \nor maimed; the ethereal astral body may occasionally be cut or bruised \nbut is healed at once by mere willing.\"  \n\"Gurudeva, are all astral persons beautiful?\"  \n\"Beauty in the astral world is known to be a spiritual quality, and not an \noutward conformation,\" Sri Yukteswar replied. \"Astral beings therefore \nattach little importance to facial features.

Thousands of earth-dwellers have \nmomentarily glimpsed an astral being or an astral world.  \n\"The advanced beings on Hiranyaloka remain mostly awake in ecstasy \nduring the long astral day and night, helping to work out intricate \nproblems of cosmic government and the redemption of prodigal sons, \nearthbound souls. When the Hiranyaloka beings sleep, they have \noccasional dreamlike astral visions. Their minds are usually engrossed in \nthe conscious state of highest nirbikalpa bliss.  \n\"Inhabitants in all parts of the astral worlds are still subject to mental \nagonies. The sensitive minds of the higher beings on planets like \nHiranyaloka feel keen pain if any mistake is made in conduct or perception \nof truth. These advanced beings endeavor to attune their every act and \nthought with the perfection of spiritual law.  \n\"Communication among the astral inhabitants is held entirely by astral \ntelepathy and television; there is none of the confusion and \nmisunderstanding of the written and spoken word which earth-dwellers \nmust endure. Just as persons on the cinema screen appear to move and \nact through a series of light pictures, and do not actually breathe, so the \nastral beings walk and work as intelligently guided and coordinated images \nof light, without the necessity of drawing power from oxygen. Man \ndepends upon solids, liquids, gases, and energy for sustenance; astral \nbeings sustain themselves principally by cosmic light.\"  \n\"Master mine, do astral beings eat anything?\" I was drinking in his \nmarvelous elucidations with the receptivity of all my faculties-mind, \nheart, soul.

Just as \ninvisible images of persons on the earth can be dug out of the ether and \nmade visible by a television apparatus, later being dismissed again into \nspace, so the God-created, unseen astral blueprints of vegetables and \nplants floating in the ether are precipitated on an astral planet by the will \nof its inhabitants. In the same way, from the wildest fancy of these \nbeings, whole gardens of fragrant flowers are materialized, returning \nlater to the etheric invisibility. Although dwellers on the heavenly planets \nlike Hiranyaloka are almost freed from any necessity of eating, still \nhigher is the unconditioned existence of almost completely liberated \nsouls in the causal world, who eat nothing save the manna of bliss.  \n\"The earth-liberated astral being meets a multitude of relatives, fathers, \nmothers, wives, husbands, and friends, acquired during different \nincarnations on earth, 43-5 as they appear from time to time in various \nparts of the astral realms. He is therefore at a loss to understand whom \nto love especially; he learns in this way to give a divine and equal love to \nall, as children and individualized expressions of God. Though the outward \nappearance of loved ones may have changed, more or less according to the \ndevelopment of new qualities in the latest life of any particular soul, the \nastral being employs his unerring intuition to recognize all those once \ndear to him in other planes of existence, and to welcome them to their \nnew astral home. Because every atom in creation is inextinguishably \ndowered with individuality, 43-6 an astral friend will be recognized no \nmatter what costume he may don, even as on earth an actor's identity is \ndiscoverable by close observation despite any disguise.  \n\"The span of life in the astral world is much longer than on earth. A \nnormal advanced astral being's average life period is from five hundred \nto one thousand years, measured in accordance with earthly standards of \ntime. As certain redwood trees outlive most trees by millenniums, or as \nsome yogis live several hundred years though most men die before the \nage of sixty, so some astral beings live much longer than the usual span of \nastral existence. Visitors to the astral world dwell there for a longer or \nshorter period in accordance with the weight of their physical karma, \nwhich draws them back to earth within a specified time.  \n"}

These three dreads are the curse of earth, where man has \nallowed his consciousness to identify itself almost wholly with a frail \nphysical body requiring constant aid from air, food, and sleep in order to \nexist at all.  \n\"Physical death is attended by the disappearance of breath and the \ndisintegration of fleshly cells.

Shedding the thought-\nform of the causal body at the end of a certain span, determined by \ncosmic law, these advanced beings then return to Hiranyaloka or a similar \nhigh astral planet, reborn in a new astral body to work out their \nunredeemed astral karma.  \n\"My son, you may now comprehend more fully that I am resurrected by \ndivine decree,\" Sri Yukteswar continued, \"as a savior of astrally \nreincarnating souls coming back from the causal sphere, in particular, \nrather than of those astral beings who are coming up from the earth. \nThose from the earth, if they still retain vestiges of material karma, do \nnot rise to the very high astral planets like Hiranyaloka.  \n\"Just as most people on earth have not learned through meditation- \nacquired vision to appreciate the superior joys and advantages of astral \nlife and thus, after death, desire to return to the limited, imperfect \npleasures of earth, so many astral beings, during the normal \ndisintegration of their astral bodies, fail to picture the advanced state of \nspiritual joy in the causal world and, dwelling on thoughts of the more \ngross and gaudy astral happiness, yearn to revisit the astral paradise. \nHeavy astral karma must be redeemed by such beings before they can \nachieve after astral death a permanent stay in the causal thought-world, \nso thinly partitioned from the Creator.  \n\"Only when a being has no further desires for experiences in the \npleasing-to-the-eye astral cosmos, and cannot be tempted to go back \nthere, does he remain in the causal world. Completing there the work of \nredeeming all causal karma or seeds of past desires, the confined soul \nthrusts out the last of the three corks of ignorance and, emerging from \nthe final jar of the causal body, commingles with the Eternal.  \n"}

For him indeed \nexisted not a single \"undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller \nreturns\"!  \n\"The interpenetration of man's three bodies is expressed in many ways \nthrough his threefold nature,\" my great guru went on. \"In the wakeful \nstate on earth a human being is conscious more or less of his three \nvehicles. When he is sensuously intent on tasting, smelling, touching, \nlistening, or seeing, he is working principally through his physical body. \nVisualizing or willing, he is working mainly through his astral body. His \ncausal medium finds expression when man is thinking or diving deep in \nintrospection or meditation; the cosmical thoughts of genius come to the \nman who habitually contacts his causal body. In this sense an individual \nmay be classified broadly as 'a material man,' 'an energetic man,' or 'an \nintellectual man.'  \n\"A man identifies himself about sixteen hours daily with his physical \nvehicle. Then he sleeps; if he dreams, he remains in his astral body, \neffortlessly creating any object even as do the astral beings. If man's \nsleep be deep and dreamless, for several hours he is able to transfer his \nconsciousness, or sense of I-ness, to the causal body; such sleep is \nrevivifying. A dreamer is contacting his astral and not his causal body; his \nsleep is not fully refreshing.\"  \nI had been lovingly observing Sri Yukteswar while he gave his wondrous \nexposition.  \n\"Angelic guru,\" I said, \"your body looks exactly as it did when last I wept \nover it in the Puri ashram.\"  \n\"O yes, my new body is a perfect copy of the old one.

Now my finer \nfleshly body-which you behold and are even now embracing rather \nclosely!-is resurrected on another finer dream-planet of God. Someday \nthat finer dream-body and finer dream-planet will pass away; they too are \nnot forever. All dream-bubbles must eventually burst at a final wakeful \ntouch.

I was \nashamed that I had pitied Master when I had seen his lifeless body at \nPuri. I comprehended at last that my guru had always been fully awake in \nGod, perceiving his own life and passing on earth, and his present \nresurrection, as nothing more than relativities of divine ideas in the \ncosmic dream.  \n\"I have now told you, Yogananda, the truths of my life, death, and \nresurrection.

Often I scolded you more than I should have. You passed my \ntest; your love shone through the clouds of all reprimands.\" He added \ntenderly, \"I have also come today to tell you: Never again shall I wear the \nstern gaze of censure. I shall scold you no more.\"  \nHow much I had missed the chastisements of my great guru! Each one had \nbeen a guardian angel of protection.  \n\"Dearest Master!

During the two hours that he spent with me in the Bombay hotel \nroom he answered my every question. A number of world prophecies \nuttered by him that June day in 1936 have already come to pass.  \n\"I leave you now, beloved one!\" At these words I felt Master melting away \nwithin my encircling arms.  \n\"My child,\" his voice rang out, vibrating into my very soul-firmament, \n\"whenever you enter the door of nirbikalpa samadhi and call on me, I shall \ncome to you in flesh and blood, even as today.\"  \nWith this celestial promise Sri Yukteswar vanished from my sight.

Yogananda, tell all!\"  \nGone was the sorrow of parting. The pity and grief for his death, long \nrobber of my peace, now fled in stark shame. Bliss poured forth like a \nfountain through endless, newly opened soul-pores. Anciently clogged with \ndisuse, they now widened in purity at the driving flood of ecstasy. \nSubconscious thoughts and feelings of my past incarnations shed their \nkarmic taints, lustrously renewed by Sri Yukteswar's divine visit.  \nIn this chapter of my autobiography I have obeyed my guru's behest and \nspread the glad tiding, though it confound once more an incurious \ngeneration.

A short drive over the \nmuddy country roads brought us to Maganvadi, the ashram of India's \npolitical saint.  \nMr. Desai led us at once to the writing room where, cross-legged, sat \nMahatma Gandhi. Pen in one hand and a scrap of paper in the other, on his \nface a vast, winning, warm-hearted smile!  \n\"Welcome!\" he scribbled in Hindi; it was a Monday, his weekly day of \nsilence.  \nThough this was our first meeting, we beamed on each other \naffectionately. In 1925 Mahatma Gandhi had honored the Ranchi school \nby a visit, and had inscribed in its guest-book a gracious tribute.  \nThe tiny 100-pound saint radiated physical, mental, and spiritual health. \nHis soft brown eyes shone with intelligence, sincerity, and discrimination; \nthis statesman has matched wits and emerged the victor in a thousand \nlegal, social, and political battles. No other leader in the world has \nattained the secure niche in the hearts of his people that Gandhi occupies \nfor India's unlettered millions. Their spontaneous tribute is his famous \ntitle-Mahatma, \"great soul.\" 44-1 For them alone Gandhi confines his attire \nto the widely-cartooned loincloth, symbol of his oneness with the \ndowntrodden masses who can afford no more.  \n"}

A front-yard well, twenty-five feet across, \nwas used, Mr. Desai said, for watering stock; near-by stood a revolving \ncement wheel for threshing rice. Each of our small bedrooms proved to \ncontain only the irreducible minimum-a bed, handmade of rope. The \nwhitewashed kitchen boasted a faucet in one corner and a fire pit for \ncooking in another. Simple Arcadian sounds reached our ears-the cries of \ncrows and sparrows, the lowing of cattle, and the rap of chisels being \nused to chip stones.  \nObserving Mr. Wright's travel diary, Mr. Desai opened a page and wrote \non it a list of Satyagraha 44-2 vows taken by all the Mahatma's strict \nfollowers (satyagrahis):  \n"}

About twenty-five barefooted \nsatyagrahis were squatting before brass cups and plates. A community \nchorus of prayer; then a meal served from large brass pots containing \nchapatis (whole-wheat unleavened bread) sprinkled with ghee; talsari \n(boiled and diced vegetables), and a lemon jam.  \nThe Mahatma ate chapatis, boiled beets, some raw vegetables, and \noranges. On the side of his plate was a large lump of very bitter neem \nleaves, a notable blood cleanser. With his spoon he separated a portion \nand placed it on my dish. I bolted it down with water, remembering \nchildhood days when Mother had forced me to swallow the disagreeable \ndose. Gandhi, however, bit by bit was eating the neem paste with as much \nrelish as if it had been a delicious sweetmeat.  \nIn this trifling incident I noted the Mahatma's ability to detach his mind \nfrom the senses at will. I recalled the famous appendectomy performed \non him some years ago. Refusing anesthetics, the saint had chatted \ncheerfully with his disciples throughout the operation, his infectious \nsmile revealing his unawareness of pain.  \nThe afternoon brought an opportunity for a chat with Gandhi's noted \ndisciple, daughter of an English admiral, Miss Madeleine Slade, now called \nMirabai. 44-3 Her strong, calm face lit with enthusiasm as she told me, in \nflawless Hindi, of her daily activities.  \n\"Rural reconstruction work is rewarding! A group of us go every morning \nat five o'clock to serve the near-by villagers and teach them simple \nhygiene. We make it a point to clean their latrines and their mud-\nthatched huts.

Why \nthe ancient rishis selected the cow for apotheosis is obvious to me. The \ncow in India was the best comparison; she was the giver of plenty. Not \nonly did she give milk, but she also made agriculture possible. The cow is a \npoem of pity; one reads pity in the gentle animal. She is the second \nmother to millions of mankind. Protection of the cow means protection of \nthe whole dumb creation of God. The appeal of the lower order of \ncreation is all the more forceful because it is speechless.\"  \n"}

Bhuta Yajna thus reinforces man's readiness to \nsuccor the weak, as he in turn is comforted by countless solicitudes of \nhigher unseen beings. Man is also under bond for rejuvenating gifts of \nnature, prodigal in earth, sea, and sky. The evolutionary barrier of \nincommunicability among nature, animals, man, and astral angels is thus \novercome by offices of silent love.  \nThe other two daily yajnas are Pitri and Nri.

'Master,' she said \nhumbly, 'if I have ever offended you, please forgive me.'\" 44-9  \nAt three o'clock that afternoon in Wardha, I betook myself, by previous \nappointment, to the writing room of the saint who had been able to make \nan unflinching disciple out of his own wife-rare miracle! Gandhi looked up \nwith his unforgettable smile.  \n\"Mahatmaji,\" I said as I squatted beside him on the uncushioned mat, \n\"please tell me your definition of ahimsa.\"  \n\"The avoidance of harm to any living creature in thought or deed.\"  \n\"Beautiful ideal! But the world will always ask: May one not kill a cobra to \nprotect a child, or one's self?\"  \n\"I could not kill a cobra without violating two of my vows- fearlessness, \nand non-killing. I would rather try inwardly to calm the snake by \nvibrations of love. I cannot possibly lower my standards to suit my \ncircumstances.\" With his amazing candor, Gandhi added, \"I must confess \nthat I could not carry on this conversation were I faced by a cobra!\"  \n"}

I would not agree, and advised him to give her some egg-\nsubstitute.  \n\"'Gandhiji,' the doctor said, 'unfertilized eggs contain no life sperm; no \nkilling is involved.'  \n\"I then gladly gave permission for my daughter-in-law to eat eggs; she \nwas soon restored to health.\"  \nOn the previous night Gandhi had expressed a wish to receive the Kriya \nYoga of Lahiri Mahasaya.

The body is \nvisualized as divided into twenty parts; the will directs energy in turn to \neach section. Soon everyone was vibrating before me like a human motor. \nIt was easy to observe the rippling effect on Gandhi's twenty body parts, \nat all times completely exposed to view! Though very thin, he is not \nunpleasingly so; the skin of his body is smooth and unwrinkled.  \nLater I initiated the group into the liberating technique of Kriya Yoga.  \nThe Mahatma has reverently studied all world religions. The Jain \nscriptures, the Biblical New Testament, and the sociological writings of \nTolstoy 44-11 are the three main sources of Gandhi's nonviolent \nconvictions. He has stated his credo thus:  \nI believe the Bible, the Koran, and the Zend-Avesta 44-12 to be as divinely \ninspired as the Vedas. I believe in the institution of Gurus, but in this age \nmillions must go without a Guru, because it is a rare thing to find a \ncombination of perfect purity and perfect learning. But one need not \ndespair of ever knowing the truth of one's religion, because the \nfundamentals of Hinduism as of every great religion are unchangeable, \nand easily understood.  \nI believe like every Hindu in God and His oneness, in rebirth and salvation. \n. . . I can no more describe my feeling for Hinduism than for my own wife. \nShe moves me as no other woman in the world can. Not that she has no \nfaults; I daresay she has many more than I see myself. But the feeling of \nan indissoluble bond is there. Even so I feel for and about Hinduism with \nall its faults and limitations. Nothing delights me so much as the music of \nthe Gita, or the Ramayana by Tulsidas. When I fancied I was taking my \nlast breath, the Gita was my solace.  \nHinduism is not an exclusive religion. In it there is room for the worship \nof all the prophets of the world. 44-13 It is not a missionary religion in the \nordinary sense of the term. It has no doubt absorbed many tribes in its \nfold, but this absorption has been of an evolutionary, imperceptible \ncharacter. Hinduism tells each man to worship God according to his own \nfaith or dharma, 44-14 and so lives at peace with all religions.  \n"}

I believe that He \nbelongs not solely to Christianity, but to the entire world, to all lands and \nraces.\"  \nOn my last evening in Wardha I addressed the meeting which had been \ncalled by Mr. Desai in Town Hall. The room was thronged to the window \nsills with about 400 people assembled to hear the talk on yoga. I spoke \nfirst in Hindi, then in English. Our little group returned to the ashram in \ntime for a good-night glimpse of Gandhi, enfolded in peace and \ncorrespondence.  \nNight was still lingering when I rose at 5:00 A.M. Village life was already \nstirring; first a bullock cart by the ashram gates, then a peasant with his \nhuge burden balanced precariously on his head. After breakfast our trio \nsought out Gandhi for farewell pronams. The saint rises at four o'clock \nfor his morning prayer.  \n\"Mahatmaji, good-by!\" I knelt to touch his feet. \"India is safe in your \nkeeping!\"  \nYears have rolled by since the Wardha idyl; the earth, oceans, and skies \nhave darkened with a world at war. Alone among great leaders, Gandhi has \noffered a practical nonviolent alternative to armed might. To redress \ngrievances and remove injustices, the Mahatma has employed nonviolent \nmeans which again and again have proved their effectiveness. He states \nhis doctrine in these words:  \nI have found that life persists in the midst of destruction. Therefore \nthere must be a higher law than that of destruction. Only under that law \nwould well-ordered society be intelligible and life worth living.  \nIf that is the law of life we must work it out in daily existence. Wherever \nthere are wars, wherever we are confronted with an opponent, conquer by \nlove. I have found that the certain law of love has answered in my own life \nas the law of destruction has never done.  \n"}

I don't claim that nonviolence has \npenetrated the 360,000,000 people in India, but I do claim it has \npenetrated deeper than any other doctrine in an incredibly short time.  \nIt takes a fairly strenuous course of training to attain a mental state of \nnonviolence. It is a disciplined life, like the life of a soldier. The perfect \nstate is reached only when the mind, body, and speech are in proper \ncoordination. Every problem would lend itself to solution if we determined \nto make the law of truth and nonviolence the law of life.  \nJust as a scientist will work wonders out of various applications of the \nlaws of nature, a man who applies the laws of love with scientific precision \ncan work greater wonders. Nonviolence is infinitely more wonderful and \nsubtle than forces of nature like, for instance, electricity. The law of love \nis a far greater science than any modern science.  \nConsulting history, one may reasonably state that the problems of \nmankind have not been solved by the use of brute force. World War I \nproduced a world-chilling snowball of war karma that swelled into World \nWar II. Only the warmth of brotherhood can melt the present colossal \nsnowball of war karma which may otherwise grow into World War III. \nThis unholy trinity will banish forever the possibility of World War IV by \na finality of atomic bombs. Use of jungle logic instead of human reason in \nsettling disputes will restore the earth to a jungle. If brothers not in \nlife, then brothers in violent death.  \nWar and crime never pay. The billions of dollars that went up in the \nsmoke of explosive nothingness would have been sufficient to have made a \nnew world, one almost free from disease and completely free from \npoverty. Not an earth of fear, chaos, famine, pestilence, the danse \nmacabre, but one broad land of peace, of prosperity, and of widening \nknowledge.  \nThe nonviolent voice of Gandhi appeals to man's highest conscience. Let \nnations ally themselves no longer with death, but with life; not with \ndestruction, but with construction; not with the Annihilator, but with the \nCreator.  \n\"One should forgive, under any injury,\" says the Mahabharata. \"It hath \nbeen said that the continuation of species is due to man's being forgiving. \nForgiveness is holiness; by forgiveness the universe is held together. \n"}

Forgiveness and gentleness are the qualities \nof the self-possessed. They represent eternal virtue.\"  \nNonviolence is the natural outgrowth of the law of forgiveness and love. \n\"If loss of life becomes necessary in a righteous battle,\" Gandhi \nproclaims, \"one should be prepared, like Jesus, to shed his own, not \nothers', blood. Eventually there will be less blood spilt in the world.\"  \nEpics shall someday be written on the Indian satyagrahis who withstood \nhate with love, violence with nonviolence, who allowed themselves to be \nmercilessly slaughtered rather than retaliate. The result on certain \nhistoric occasions was that the armed opponents threw down their guns \nand fled, shamed, shaken to their depths by the sight of men who valued \nthe life of another above their own.  \n\"I would wait, if need be for ages,\" Gandhi says, \"rather than seek the \nfreedom of my country through bloody means.\" Never does the Mahatma \nforget the majestic warning: \"All they that take the sword shall perish \nwith the sword.\" 44-16 Gandhi has written:  \nI call myself a nationalist, but my nationalism is as broad as the universe. \nIt includes in its sweep all the nations of the earth. 44-17 My nationalism \nincludes the well-being of the whole world. I do not want my India to rise \non the ashes of other nations. I do not want India to exploit a single \nhuman being. I want India to be strong in order that she can infect the \nother nations also with her strength. Not so with a single nation in Europe \ntoday; they do not give strength to the others.  \nPresident Wilson mentioned his beautiful fourteen points, but said: \n\"After all, if this endeavor of ours to arrive at peace fails, we have our \narmaments to fall back upon.\" I want to reverse that position, and I say: \n\"Our armaments have failed already. Let us now be in search of something \nnew; let us try the force of love and God which is truth.\" When we have \ngot that, we shall want nothing else.  \nBy the Mahatma's training of thousands of true satyagrahis (those who \nhave taken the eleven rigorous vows mentioned in the first part of this \nchapter), who in turn spread the message; by patiently educating the \nIndian masses to understand the spiritual and eventually material \nbenefits of nonviolence; by arming his people with nonviolent weapons- \nnon-cooperation with injustice, the willingness to endure indignities, \n"}

Nonviolent methods for eradication \nof all wrongs and evils have been strikingly applied not only in the political \narena but in the delicate and complicated field of Indian social reform. \nGandhi and his followers have removed many longstanding feuds between \nHindus and Mohammedans; hundreds of thousands of Moslems look to the \nMahatma as their leader. The untouchables have found in him their \nfearless and triumphant champion. \"If there be a rebirth in store for \nme,\" Gandhi wrote, \"I wish to be born a pariah in the midst of pariahs, \nbecause thereby I would be able to render them more effective service.\"  \nThe Mahatma is indeed a \"great soul,\" but it was illiterate millions who \nhad the discernment to bestow the title. This gentle prophet is honored \nin his own land. The lowly peasant has been able to rise to Gandhi's high \nchallenge. The Mahatma wholeheartedly believes in the inherent nobility \nof man. The inevitable failures have never disillusioned him. \"Even if the \nopponent plays him false twenty times,\" he writes, \"the satyagrahi is \nready to trust him the twenty- first time, for an implicit trust in human \nnature is the very essence of the creed.\" 44-18  \n\"Mahatmaji, you are an exceptional man. You must not expect the world to \nact as you do.\" A critic once made this observation.  \n\"It is curious how we delude ourselves, fancying that the body can be \nimproved, but that it is impossible to evoke the hidden powers of the \nsoul,\" Gandhi replied. \"I am engaged in trying to show that if I have any \nof those powers, I am as frail a mortal as any of us and that I never had \nanything extraordinary about me nor have I now.

An Indian woman saint would be sincerely appreciated there by \nspiritual seekers.

Wherever she goes, \nwe must go.\"  \nReluctantly I abandoned the plan, as possessing an impractical feature of \nspontaneous enlargement!  \n\"Please come at least to Ranchi, with your disciples,\" I said on taking leave \nof the saint. \"As a divine child yourself, you will enjoy the little ones in my \nschool.\"  \n\"Whenever Father takes me, I will gladly go.\"  \nA short time later the Ranchi Vidyalaya was in gala array for the saint's \npromised visit. The youngsters looked forward to any day of festivity-no \nlessons, hours of music, and a feast for the climax!  \n\"Victory!

May I thus atone for the \nsin I have today committed against you, my guru.'  \n\"Even when I quietly accepted this proposal of my husband's, 'I was the \nsame.' And, Father, in front of you now, 'I am the same.' Ever afterward, \nthough the dance of creation change around me in the hall of eternity, 'I \nshall be the same.'\"  \n"}

She gave me, bit by bit, the \nfollowing information:  \n\"I have never had any children; many years ago I became a widow. I sleep \nvery little, as sleep and waking are the same to me. I meditate at night, \nattending to my domestic duties in the daytime. I slightly feel the change \nin climate from season to season. I have never been sick or experienced \nany disease.

My older brother had \nplayfully pushed me into a fifteen-foot pool in a small town in Nebraska. I \nwas only five years old then. As I was about to sink for the second time \nunder the water, a dazzling multicolored light appeared, filling all space. \nIn the midst was the figure of a man with tranquil eyes and a reassuring \nsmile. My body was sinking for the third time when one of my brother's \ncompanions bent a tall slender willow tree in such a low dip that I could \ngrasp it with my desperate fingers. The boys lifted me to the bank and \nsuccessfully gave me first-aid treatment.  \n\"Twelve years later, a youth of seventeen, I visited Chicago with my \nmother.

Blase' no longer, dear New \nYorkers; your hearts had soared out in a simple paean of rejoicing!
