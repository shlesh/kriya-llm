(These are the \"seven stars\" and ''seven churches\"\nspoken of by St. John in the little-understood book of Revelation in the Bible.)\nEncased in the bodily prison, the soul consciousness and life force become\nidentified with the physical vehicle and its mortal limitations. Scientific med-\nitation awakens the soul consciousness in the seven cerebrospinal centers. In\na state of divine recollectedness, the soul intuitively realizes its immortal\n\n| । we nature and origin. -The various progressive states of soul awakening are\naccompanied by an ever increasing accession of inner peace and joy. In the\nmost exalted states, soul and Spirit become reunited in ecstatic, blissful\ncommunion, or samadhi.\n\nBy meditation, then, we connect the little joy of the soul with the vast joy\nof the Spirit. Meditation should not be confused with ordinary concentration.\nConcentration consists in freeing the attention from distractions and in focus-\ning it on any thought in which one may be interested. Meditation is that spe-\ncial form of concentration in which the attention has been liberated from rest-\nlessness and is focused on God. Meditation is concentration used to know God.\n\nPOSTURE One of the first requisites for meditation is correct posture.\n\nThe spine should be erect. When the devotee is seeking to direct\nhis mind and life force upward through the cerebrospinal axis to the centers\nof higher consciousness in the brain, he should avoid stricture or pinching of\nthe spinal nerves caused by improper posture.\n\nThose persons whose legs are supple may prefer to meditate sitting cross~\nlegged on a cushion on the floor, or ona firm bed. However, Paramahansa\nYogananda recommended for most Westerners the following meditation pose:\n\n© Sit on a straight armless chair with the feet resting flat on the floor.\nHold spine erect, abdomen in, chest out, shoulders back, chin parallel to the\n\n"}

The hands, with palms upturned, should rest on the legs at the\njuncture of the thighs and the abdominal region to prevent the body from bend-\ning forward. The meditation chair should be of comfortable height, other-\nwise there is a tendency to allow the torso to lean forward or backward. If\nthe correct posture has been assumed, the body will be stable yet relaxed,\n\nso that it is easily possible to remain completely still, without moving a mus-\ncle.\n\nEach of the foregoing details is a contributing factor toward the chief\naim of the meditation posture--an erect spine, held stable without strain or\ntension for the duration of the meditation period. If, because of bad habits\nof posture or congenital defects of posture, you experience difficulty or dis-\ncomfort in maintaining the specified positions of feet, hands, shoulders,\nchest, and abdomen, make whatever commonsense adjustments are necessary\nto your individual need; but strive always toward accomplishing the ideal pos-\nture recommended by Paramahansa Yogananda.\n\nWhen you are established in the meditation pose, inhale slowly and deep-\nly (through the nostrils) to a count of 20; hold the breath to a count of 20;\nexhale slowly (through the mouth )to a count of 20. Practice this six to\ntwelve times. (A shorter count may be used, provided it is the same count in\neach of the three parts.) Then inhale, tensing the whole body and clenching\nthe fists. Relax all the body parts at once and, as youdo so, expel the breath\nthrough the mouth in a double exhalation, \"huh, huh.\" Repeat this practice\nsix times. Then forget the breath. Let it flow in and out naturally, of its\nown accord, as in ordinary breathing.\n\nWith the eyelids half closed (or completely closed, if this is more com-\nfortable to you), look upward, focusing the gaze and the attention as though\nlooking out through a point between the eyebrows. (A person deep in concen-\ntration often \"knits\" his brows at this spot.) Do not cross the eyes or strain\nthem; the upward gaze comes naturally when one is relaxed and calmly con-\ncentrated. What is important is fixing the whole attention at the point between\nthe eyebrows. This is the Christ Consciousness center, the seat of the single\neye spoken of by Christ: \"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine\neye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light'' (Matthew 6:22). When the\npurpose of meditation is fulfilled, the devotee finds his consciousness auto-\nmatically concentrated at the spiritual eye, and he experiences, according to\nhis inner spiritual capacity, a state of joyous divine union with Spirit.\n\nMaking a steadfast effort, the beginner may in time perceive light, or\neven see the spiritual eye of three colors-~-a reflection of the actual luminous\neye in the medulla oblongata (at the base of the skull where it joins the neck).\nThis single eye of light reflected in the forehead is the astral eye of intuitive\nomnipresent perception. It takes deep concentration and calmness to behold\nthe spiritual eye; a golden halo surrounding a circle of blue, in the center of\nwhich palpitates a five-pointed white star. Those who do see the spiritual eye\n\n"}

The depth of calmness and concentration necessary for this are\nnaturally developed through steady practice of the scientific SRF techniques\nof concentration and meditation (Lessons 21 and 29).\n\nWhether you see the light of the spiritual eye or not, however, you should\ncontinue to concentrate at the Christ Consciousness center between the eye-\nbrows, praying deeply to God and His great saints. In the language of your\nheart invoke their presence and their blessings. A good practice is to take\nan affirmation or a prayer from the Lessons, or from Paramahansa Yoga-\nnandaji's ''Whispers from Eternity\" or \"Metaphysical Meditations, \" and\nspiritualize it with your own devotional yearning. Silently chant and pray to\nGod, keeping the attention at the point between the eyebrows, until you feel\nGod's response as calm, deep peace and inner joy.\n\nVISUALIZATION Divine consciousness is omnipresent. In order to attune\n\none's consciousness to it, it is necessary first to expand\nthe mind by meditation on some aspect of God's infinite nature. Visualization\nis not realization; but visualization is an effective aid in deepening one's con-\ncentration, which is essential for the deep meditation that yields realization.\nThe following exercise in visualization and mental expansion given by Parama-\nhansa Yogananda will be found helpful in preparing the mind to practice the\nscientific techniques of meditation that are given in later Lessons:\n\n\"Sit upright. Focus your gaze and your mind at the Christ Consciousness\ncenter between the eyebrows. Fill your heart with joy. Behold! the sphere\nof darkness that you see with closed eyes is becoming a sphere of light and\njoy. This sphere is enlarging. Now it is bigger than your body. Go on\nexpanding the sphere of joy and light. Your home and everyone in it are pres-\nent in the sphere of light that you are beholding. Go on expanding it until you\nsee your whole city in this sphere of light and joy. Ever increasing, the\nsphere of light and joy is encompassing the entire United States, and still it is\nexpanding, including Europe, Asia, the world! See the world bathed in the\nlight of this peaceful sphere of joy. The earth appears as a little ball moving\nin the vast sphere of light and joy. The sphere is becoming even larger; see!\nour planetary and stellar system, the Milky Way, and island galaxies, like\nlittle bubbles, are floating in it.\n\n\"Expand the sphere of light and joy within you, in which all things are mov-\ning, glimmering like the lights of a city. Meditate on and try to be one with\nthat joy. God 15 joy, and we must find Him through joy. The scriptures say:\n'Thou art That.' Your Self is one with this vast sphere of light that is your\nFather. Youare this sphere of light and joy! Meditate on that. You have no\nboundaries-~-eternity above, below, everywhere. In this eternal sphere of\nlight and joy all things are moving. Mentally affirm: 'In me worlds are\nfloating like bubbles. I and my Father are One.'\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - How To Meditate (6p).pdf", "page": 4, "text": "Self- Realization Fellowship technique: How to Meditate 4\n\n\"Now open your eyes. Look at the body and see how little itis! Close\nyour eyes and realize again that you are not the'body. You are the eternal\nsphere of light and joy in which all things have their being. Go on meditating,\nmentally affirming: 'Iam the cosmic sphere of light, of joy, of love, in\nwhich worlds and universes are floating like bubbles. My Father is this cos-\nmic sphere of light; my Father and Iare One. Iam not the body; I am the\neternal sphere of light. Aum. Aum. Amen. 11\n\n(Paramahansa Yogananda cautioned devotees against the erroneous\nthought, \"Iam God.'! One should realize, rather, ''God has become myself.\"\nThe soul is like a wave on the sea-bosom of Spirit. The soul wave is one\nwith the Sea, but the wave is not the Sea. )\n\nThrough daily practice of the foregoing instructions, you can prepare\nyourself for the practice of the basic techniques of concentration and medita-~\ntion that are given in later Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons. These\nscientific techniques will enable you to dive ever more deeply in the great\nocean of God's presence. We all exist at this very moment in that ocean of\nSpirit; but only by steadfast, devoted, scientific meditation may we conscious~\nly perceive that we are individualized soul waves on the vast ocean of God's\nbliss.\n\nThe meditation period should last at least thirty minutes in the morning\nand thirty minutes at night. The longer you sit, enjoying the state of medi-\ntative calm, the faster you will progress spiritually. Carry into your daily\nactivities the calmness you feel in meditation; that calmness will help you to\nbring harmony and happiness into every department of your life.\n\nUnending joy awaits the sincere truth seeker who conscientiously medi-\ntates each day. Through the grace of God, through the blessings of the Mas-\nters, and through your own devotional effort you can achieve the state of\ndivine joy experienced by all saints that have become established in the Lord\n(that have become consciously aware of their soul unity with Spirit).\n\nKEY POINTS\n\n1. Set aside a regular time and place for your daily practices of the\nspiritual techniques taught by Self-Realization Fellowship. Try to find a quiet\nplace where you can be free from outside distractions and thus be able to con-\ncentrate with more intensity. If possible, never use that place for any other\npurpose than meditation. Thus you will impregnate the spot with spiritual\nvibrations that will help you to make each day's meditation deeper than the\nmeditation of the preceding day. You may have there a small altar with the\npictures of Christ, Krishna, and the Gurus of Self-Realization Fellowship.\n\n2. Always begin and end your meditation with a prayer, suchas: ''Heaven-\nly Father, Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna, Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri\n\n"}

Free my life from all obstacles of delusion, and lead me to\nThy shores of fulfillment. '' Or, \"May Thy love shine forever on the sanctu-\nary of my devotion, and may I be able to awaken Thy love in all hearts. \"'\n\n3. Early morning, upon arising, and the period just before retiring at\nnight are excellent times for meditation. Do not try to meditate just after\neating. Wait at least an hour if possible. The kind of food one eats also has\na definite bearing on one's health or ill health, not only of the body but of the\nmind. Be sure the diet includes an abundance of fresh vegetables and fruits.\nEat nuts, cheese, eggs, and vegetable proteins in preference to meat. Fruits\nare the most spiritually beneficial of all foods.\n\n4. It is good to use a woolen blanket or silk cloth (or both, with the silk\non top) to cover your meditation seat. Drape the cloth over the back of the\nchair if a chair is used, and place one end of the cloth on the floor under your\nfeet. The cloth helps to insulate the body from subtle earth currents. Their\nmagnetic downward pull toward material perceptions is undesirable for the\nmeditating devotee. The yogis have found, also, that facing East (the direc-\ntion from which subtle spiritual solar currents are always flowing) is helpful\nin meditation.\n\n5. Bathing has a cleansing effect not only on the body but also on the\n\n“mind, and is therefore a beneficial practice before meditation. Bathing opens = `\n\nthe pores allowing toxins to escape; it also helps to distribute life energy\nevenly throughout the body, quieting the nerves and inducing calmness. One\nshould also take a \"mental bath\" before meditation: put aside all worries and\nproblems. Completely give to God the time you have set aside for meditation.\nConcentrate on one of His infinite aspects--Peace, Joy, Wisdom, Love, Light,\nBeauty--or on a personal aspect, such as that of the ever-loving, all-forgiving\nDivine Mother. Many devotees find inspiration by meditating on divine incar-\nnations of God such as Christ and the Masters. Reading a devotional passage\nfrom \"Whispers from Eternity\" or \"Metaphysical Meditations\" or singing a\ndevotional song from ''Cosmic Chants'' helps to uplift the mind. Meditation\n\nin itself is an unequaled \"spiritual bath''--a cleansing and rejuvenation of\nbody, mind, and soul.\n\n6. Practice of the Self-Realization Fellowship Energization Exercises--\nand also certain yoga asanas (body postures) - -15 beneficial in preparing the\nbody for deep meditation. The life forces in the body are harmonized by these\nrelaxing and calming methods, and one's attention is freed from aches and\npains and from the drowsiness or restlessness that keep the mind sense bound\nand body conscious.\n\nBe regular in your meditations (whether they be deep, or, in the begin-\nning, restless ). Be persistent if you would attract God's attention. Remem-\nber that meditation should be practiced with devotion, with real love for God.\n"}

He cannot\nresist the magnetic attraction of human soul yearning. Meditation techniques\nhelp you to awaken and whet that divine craving which will take you to the\nheights of realization, of soul union with God-Bliss. Resolve that you will\nnever give up until He comes to you. Whether you realize it or not, He is\n\nlistening to the cry of your heart. In His own time He will bestow the supreme\ngift of Himself.\n\n"}
