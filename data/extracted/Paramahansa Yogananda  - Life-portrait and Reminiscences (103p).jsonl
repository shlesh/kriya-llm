{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 6, "text": " \nYEAR 2006 PREFACE \n \n \n \nSri Sailendra Bejoy Dasgupta had written this very manuscript near the end of his \nlife in the months of October 1983 through January 1984. In those days that great disciple \nof Sriyukteshvar Giri had perpetually sat on his bed in yoga posture in the little kitchen \nroom there in Barrackpore (across the river from Serampore) and he very rarely got up.  \nEach evening after my Kriya sadhana would be completed the Master liked that I should \ncome and sit beside him and for that purpose he had a chair next to his bed which was \nconsidered “my chair.” Sitting there together we would have our private and quiet talks \nabout Kriya sadhana as the blanket of night slipped over the sky and the kerosene lamp \nwould be lit. As the shadows danced on the walls we would speak of many things and he \nwould quietly tell me the stories of his Gurudev, Swami Sriyukteshvar Giriji Maharaj or \nstories of Yogiraj Sri Sri Lahiri Baba or deliver his peerless insights on the Kriya Yoga of \nLahiri Mahasay. In front of us was a small table on which we would take our meals. Dadu \nhad several things on the table such as an old Bengali anthropology book (which now sits \non the table next to me!) and a small bundle of pencils and so on. Also on that table at \nthat time was this very handwritten Bengali manuscript which he was working on. Each \nevening he would tell me what he had written that day in the manuscript which contained \nsome accounts concerning his brother disciple, the Paramhansa Yogananda Giri. At this \ntime in his life he was busy putting into writing much of his knowledge of historic Kriya \nYoga, both concerning the tradition and history as well as those portions of the traditional \ntechnical aspect of Kriya which could be spoken of publicly (see chapter 5 of his book \n“Kriya Yoga”). This he was doing in order to preserve the historic tradition and \nknowledge of the events. He had spent his whole life surrounded by Kriya and had \npersonally known several of the direct disciples of the Yogiraj Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasay. He \nhad received Kriya in year 1929 from Sriyukteshvar direct and sat at Swami’s feet as an \neminent and well loved disciple and as stated, the course of his life had brought him in \nintimate contact with several illustrious disciples of Yogiraj Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasay such \nas Shastri Mahasay and others and he also enjoyed close friendship with personages \nengaged in the preserving of Kriya tradition such as his friend Sri Ananda Mohan Lahiri, \na grandson of the Yogiraj (who was on the staff at Yoganandaji’s Ranchi school). \n \nDadu had been in a unique position during Yoganandaji’s return visit to India in \nyear 1935-36.  At that time a Bengali language secretary was needed (Yoganandaji’s \ndisciple Richard Wright had acted as the English language secretary). Due to Dadu’s keen \nintelligence (he had been an eminent scholar of the Calcutta University—First Class First \nin Anthropology) it naturally came about for him to fill that role and during these months \nhe was almost always in the presence of Yoganandaji and the two developed very great \nlove for each other. It was to accurately record the incidents of that time that Dadu set \nabout to write this book in the end months of his life (Dadu left this earth just weeks after \ncompleting this manuscript). His perspective is unique, recording the events from the \nstandpoint of being a spiritual brother and observer.  \n  \nRevered Swami Satyananda Giri Maharaj (eminent disciple of Sriyukteshvar) had \nwritten in his book “Yogananda Sanga” the following -- \n5 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Swamiji had a great wish that he would take Sailendra Bejoy to America. \nEven after [Yoganandaji] went back to America, he wrote to me about this many times. \nBut at that time, Sailendra Bejoy did not particularly have much interest in that \ndirection.” \n \nI feel it is relevant to include in this Preface a story which Dadu told me in private \nas he was writing this manuscript in year 1983. At Dadu's wish I had been staying with \nhim in his house. One sunny afternoon Dadu was in the kitchen working on this book and \nI had just risen from practicing Kriya. It had been our custom to have our tea and biscuits \ntogether in the afternoon each day. That particular day Dadu called me to his side in great \njoy with a smile on his face. He had been remembering the story of his first meeting with \nhis famous brother disciple, Paramhansa Swami Yogananda. Although the two were both \ndirect disciples of the Swami Maharaj (Swami Sriyukteshvar) the two had never met \nbefore that particular day in year 1935. The eventful meeting took place September 18 of \nthat year at the train station in Calcutta. Yoganandaji was triumphantly returning home \nafter spending many years in the western lands. A huge crowd had assembled at the train \nstation to greet him and among that crowd was Dadu. As Yoganandaji's train pulled into \nthe station the car which contained Swamiji stopped right in front of the exact spot where \nDadu was standing. As soon as Swamiji stepped out of the car and onto the platform he \nsaw Dadu and looked directly at him and he said— \n\"Ah! Here is the biographer!\" \n \nWe owe many thanks to various Kriyavans who triumphed over tremendously \ndifficult obstacles to tend to the work of translating the hand written manuscript from the \noriginal Bengali, in which it is written, and putting it carefully and exactly into the \nEnglish form found in this book and to those who worked so hard on the matter of \npublishing. Those selfless workers wish to remain anonymous and so their names cannot \nbe mentioned here. But we remain forever grateful. \n \nIt was Sri Dasguptaji’s intention that this manuscript be published after being \ncompleted but in the time following His passing in March 1984 there was not the means \namong those of us who sat at His feet to immediately go ahead with the project.  Now at \nthis time it is possible and the means are here. \nLet the Great One’s wish be fulfilled. \n \n                                                                       Salutations,  \n \n                                                                       n.w.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 8, "text": " \nDEDICATION \n \n \n \n \nParamhansa Yogananda himself published his autobiography more than a decade \nbefore leaving his body. Since then, his presence has spread through the current of his \nworld-encompassing work. In a highly-paced life, with every year filled with significant \nevents, he was guided in a singular direction through it all: India's ancient and beloved \nyoga-sadhana – his teaching and establishing of that science as well as its propagation. \nThis one-pointed motion of his life was not restrained by the following and adhering to \nsome previously formulated way; instead, it was as if all of the work was resolutely \ncarried out by the power of some unseen Force. Because of this, the lack of exacting \nprecision regarding the recording of many of the actual happenings has become \nincreasingly evident; on the contrary, because of emotionalism, it has been seen that \nimmaculate versions of those accounts have been accepted. \n \n \nThe guru for the disciple, or the worshipped being for the devotee – it is because \nsuch persons of reverence are portrayed as gods – avatars [incarnations of God] – that it \nbrings us such fulfillment in our connection with them; but in the spiritual perspective, \nevery single being is a child of the Eternal – be it guru, be it disciple. The difference \nbetween them is only in the state of Divine Experience – a difference of Awakening [or – \nRevelation]. Bhagavan Sri Sri Sai Baba said summarily in one statement, “I am God; you \nare also God; I know that I am God, but you don’t know that you are God.” This \nfundamental understanding of Truth is substantiated in six [primary] ways in Hindu \nphilosophy. In present times, life-portraits and reminiscient accounts have also been \nwritten regarding that field. “Dev-manav” – godman* –  these are terms which define a \nbeing in whom the attributes of “dev” [deity, god] are intermixed with those of “manav” \n[human]; they are not excluded from each other. Therefore, all of the qualities of a human \nbeing certainly must manifest in the “dev-manav” [godman]. Their exceptional feature is \nthat “God-ness” manifests much more through them. For thousands of years, the \nteachings of the Hindu scriptures – in study, instruction and sadhana [teachings in \npractice] – have been devoted to showing human beings the means of attaining the \nEternity/Immortality of “Dev.” From time to time, the appearance of certain God-\nintoxicated beings verifies the truth of these universal teachings and provides a visible \nexample to the world. Much of the life of Yogananda was also in this way and is one such \nexample. \n \n[*Translator’s note: The word “godman” is in English in the original.] \n \n \nYogananda played out his “lila” [divine sport] in this world for 59 years, 2 months \nand 2 days. He spent more than half of this continuously moving life – almost 32 years – \nin America, during which time he returned to India and stayed for exactly 3 years. This \nauthor was in his very close companionship for one year, during the time Yoganandaji \nhad returned to see and travel his Motherland. However, while attending the \nBrahmacharya Vidyalaya – a school which was founded by Yoganandaji himself – as a \nresident brahmachari student in 1928, this writer had already come to know something of \n7 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 9, "text": " \nhis glorious life, particularly from Yoganandaji’s childhood companion as well as \nunfaultable and obedient follower - Swami Satyananda. Satyanandaji was the principal of \nthe Brahmacharya Vidyalaya at that time, and one who acted as a guardian and benefactor \nto this writer, helping him in every area and every way, so that the writer could be ably \nestablished in this life. It is because of Satyanandaji’s graciousness that this writer was \nable to have the wondrous and great fortune of having a place at the feet of Yoganandaji’s \ngurudev, Srimat Swami Sriyukteshvar, and this writer is deeply gratified to have had his \nblessing and affection. Yoganandaji’s life was an “open book.” Even though this writer \nwas with him regularly for only one year, upon experiencing the touch of his loving heart \nand the profundity of his spiritual state, it did not take a great deal of time to get to know \nthe whole person. During his stay in India and for some time after returning to America, \nYoganandaji proposed many times that this writer take a vow of sannyas and go with him \nto America. Although deeply stirred, this writer did not have the good fortune of taking \nup that priceless proposition at that time. Refusing to accept this, Yoganandaji said, “Now \nI’m courting you. Later, even if you grind your head you won’t get this opportunity.” \nEven the efforts of some opportunistic people attempting to spread slander about this \nwriter in their correspondence with Yoganandaji did not end Swamiji’s efforts to take the \nwriter to America. Although Satyanandaji wrote many entreating letters to this writer to \nclarify the situation with Yoganandaji, this writer himself did not agree to write to \nYoganandaji and let him know the truth about what was being said about him [the writer]. \nYoganandaji would not settle for this and had said, “I’ll return to India and uncover the \ntruth about everything myself. There’s no need to write letters.” How could Yoganandaji \nhave been wrong about the man for whom he had had such great affection? The destroyer \nof vanity – God – annihilates everyone’s vain pride. So, shattering this writer’s vanity \nlike lightning striking with no clouds in sight, this extraordinary “manav santan” [son of \nhumanity] suddenly left this Earth in 1952. The possibility of talking openly was forever \nerased; one’s pain was destined to remain within forever. \n \n \nThe author of this book gathered most of the material for this book directly from \nhis personal talks with Swami Yoganandaji himself, as well as from personal talks with \nYoganandaji’s childhood companion Satyanandaji and Swamiji’s relatives, friends and \nstudents. Some material was collected from “Inner Culture,” a journal published by the \nprimary spiritual organization founded by Swamiji in America. But most importantly, this \nwriter was made aware of many hitherto unknown things via three particularly essential \nways. First: this writer was blessed with Yoganandaji’s affection and trust. Second: this \nwriter was directly initiated by Swamiji’s guru Sriyukteshvarji and he was regularly in \nSriyukteshvarji’s physical company. During this time, this writer was privileged to hear \nhis Gurudev speak descriptively about Yoganandaji carrying out his duties when he was \nstill living in India, as well as Sriyukteshvarji’s own feelings at the time and the Divine \nGrace around such activities. And third: this writer was the exceptional recipient of \nSwami Satyanandaji’s great affection and trust. At an incalculably precious moment in a \ntime when the secret methods of Kriya Yoga sadhana were being spread in India and \nsubsequently in the world, the goddess of fate placed upon this writer this undertaking. \nWhether the writing of this life-portrait properly carried out this unforeseen service can \nonly be judged by fellow spiritual practitioners and the readers. This book has no \nintention of spreading any defamation or debating any useless matters. \n8 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 10, "text": " \n \n \nIn English, Bengali and Hindi, this writer’s book on Kriya Yoga* covered the \nendeavors of three extraordinary beings regarding the spreading of Kriya Yoga – Yogiraj \nSri Sri Shyama Charan Lahiri, Srimat Swami Sriyukteshvarji and Paramhansa Swami \nYogananda. Recently, this writer completed his English work “Ten Eminent Disciples of \nBanares\" (Yogiraj and His Eminent Disciples).** In this book, Yogiraj and Swami \nSriyukteshvarji’s lives were expounded upon in detail. The life of Yoganandaji could not \nbe included in that book simply because Yoganandaji was not a direct disciple – \n“shishya” - of Yogiraj; he was Yogiraj’s “prashishya” - a disciple of Yogiraj’s disciple \n[Sriyukteshvarji]. For this reason, it was felt that a separate biography of Yoganandaji \nwas necessary. This Bengali version of the book has come to be because the writer felt it \neasiest to write about the memories of being with Yoganandaji in Bengali, even though \nmany friends, devotees and interested persons have asked for this biography to be written \nin English as well. \n \n[*Editor’s note: Please see the book \"Kriya Yoga\" by Sailendra Bejoy Dasgupta at \nwww.yoganiketan.net.] \n \n[**Editor's note: yet to be presented] \n \n \nThe author of this biographical work has simply put to paper the different life-\nsituations with Paramhansaji just as the writer experienced and felt them.

It \nis proper here to mention a laudatory statement regarding Yoganandaji made by a \nprogressively minded Parsi lady of very high distinction from Bombay. Srimati Firoza \nTaliyar Khan* has traveled widely, including many places in India, Europe and the \nUnited States. She visited and met with Yoganandaji several times at his primary spiritual \ninstitution’s headquarters at Mount Washington in Los Angeles, and she came to know \nabout every area of Yoganandaji’s work. Although she leads the life of a very modern \nwoman, Ms. Firoza Khan is exceptionally knowledgeable about Indian culture and has \nbeen in the company of many Godlike saints and sages. She was an ardent devotee and \nsupporter of Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi of Tiruvannamalai. She often resided in a small \ncottage that she procured near the Maharshi’s ashram, and was regularly in his presence. \nSometime during the 1930’s, this noble and distinguished woman visited the Yogoda \nSatsanga Ashram in Ranchi for a few days. One day during that time she said to this \nwriter, “I’ve seen many Godlike saints and spent time in their company as well, and \nYogananda is truly great, because he knows how to love.” Those who were close \nto him and who were blessed to be touched by his loving heart are well aware of the truth \nof this statement. This magnanimity of heart was at the root and center of all of the \naccomplishments of Yoganandaji’s life. \n \n[*Editor’s note: Saintly Srimati Firoza Taliyar Khan, or “Mother Thalaiyar Khan,” had \ngreat love for the devotees of God and she used to visit them all, from Anandamoyee Ma \nto Yogananda Paramhansa. In her Autobiography entitled “Arunachala Ramana,” she has \nrecounted how she received darshan of one of the forms of Divine Mother (Tulija-\nBhavani) at the age of eight. From her childhood she received loving guidance in \nmeditation from a divine form. She came to Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi and stayed in \nArunachalam. As a lofty spiritual devotee, she faced severe trials of life to stay in the \npath.] \n \n \nThe biographer has a very difficult responsibility. Himself being the recipient of \nthe love and respect of such a soul, the writer is bound and compelled to a perspective \ndirected by his greatest influence. One is pulled to portray everything in a brilliant life \nonly from that side. Because of this, it is not a simple task to draw an impersonal and \ncomplete picture of the person. In 1935 Yoganandaji had returned to India and this writer \nwent to visit him at Swamiji’s residence. Upon seeing the writer, Swamiji turned to his \nAmerican personal secretary Charles Richard Wright and said, “Look, look! Doesn’t he \nlook just like Mahadev Desai?” After arriving in Bombay from America, Swamiji had \ntaken a detour from his train journey to Calcutta and had gone to Wardha to see Mahatma \nGandhi at Gandhiji’s ashram. There Swamiji had met Mahatmaji’s personal secretary, \nbiographer and publisher of the “Navajivan” journal – Mahadev Desai. There must have \nbeen some similarity in the appearances of Mahadev Desai and this writer, hence that \n10 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Perhaps it was because in those days this writer used to dress in plain cotton \ndhoti and kurta when attending to his full-time responsibilities with Yoganandaji. \nSwamiji used to introduce this writer as “My Indian personal secretary.” Sometimes as \nsoon as he would see the writer, he would speak out, “Here comes the biographer.” Of \ncourse, he addressed the writer in this way only out of love and affection. The writer \ncould not even imagine at that time that someday long afterwards - almost a half-century \nlater – he would be endeavoring to write the biography of Swamiji himself. Perhaps this \nis how the spontaneous impressions in the minds of realized beings and prophecies that \nspring forth from their saintly mouths become fulfilled. \n \n \nBirth and Childhood \n \n \nIn the final decade of the 19th century, on January 5, 1896 a child was born to a \nBengali couple residing in the town of Gorakhpur in what is now known as the province \nof Uttar Pradesh. Named Mukunda Lal, later in life this child would be known as Swami \nYogananda and eventually as Paramhansa Swami Yogananda. Father Bhagabati Charan \nGhosh kept his household in Icchapur in the 24 Pargana District of Bengal. But because \nof being in an administrative position in governmental service, he often had to travel to \nUttar Pradesh, Punjab and other places outside of Bengal for his work. Bhagabati Charan \nwas respected as a dedicated, serious-minded, highly-skilled and proficient administrator. \nGyanprabha Devi was a devout wife, pious and religiously observant, and the epitome of \na loving and affectionate mother. Exceedingly beautiful, she was the possessor of a pair \nof indescribably striking eyes – eyes in which Mukunda Lal felt the Mother of the \nUniverse. All of Mukunda Lal’s brothers and sisters were born with their mother’s \nstunning eyes. A few years before Mukunda Lal’s birth, Bhagabati Charan and his wife \nwere initiated into the practice of Kriya Yoga by Kashi Baba Yogiraj Sri Sri Shyama \nCharan Lahiri. It was as if a dictum of the Bhagavad Gita had become exemplified: the \nresult of Mukunda Lal’s beneficent efforts in his previous life had awarded him a \npriceless birth in a household of yogis. \n \n \nBhagabati Charan and Gyanprabha Devi had eight children – four boys and four \ngirls. Mukunda Lal was the fourth. Brother Ananta Lal was the eldest; after him was \neldest sister Roma Devi and middle sister Uma Devi. Mukunda Lal and Roma Devi were \nvery close. The third daughter was Surjabati Devi and the youngest of the girls was \nNalini Devi who was very dear to Mukunda Lal. Brother Sananda Lal was the seventh \nchild, and the youngest of all of the children was brother Bishnu Charan. Bhagabati \nCharan spoke sparingly and was of a somber nature, and his children looked up to him \nwith deference and respect. Mother Gyanprabha was the opposite; full of expressive \naffection, she was the embodiment of compassion and extremely religious. The children \nwere primarily brought up in their mother’s influence. For Mukunda Lal his mother was \nlife itself. Gyanprabha Devi would often be taken aback and concerned by signs of her \ndear son’s uncommonly spiritual nature and extraordinary supernatural abilities, even as a \nchild. When she took Mukunda Lal in his infancy to Sri Guru Yogiraj Shyama Charan for \nHis blessings, the Great Yogi held the child in His lap and said, “I see that this boy will be \nan engine in the future.” Perhaps this prophetic statement of blessing was an indication of \n11 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

By the time of their \narrival, she was gone – leaving all. There was a strange incident that had happened \npreviously that shadowed over this rush to make arrangements for Ananta Lal’s wedding. \nSome days before, Bhagabati Charan was with his family in Lahore [in what is now \nknown as Pakistan]. One day, in the middle of the day when Bhagabati Charan was away \nat work, an elderly sannyasi knocked on the door of the Ghosh residence. Just as \nGyanprabha Devi opened the door, the holy man walked in and said that he was directed \nby a great Himalayan saint to come there. He handed an amulet to Gyanprabha Devi and \nsaid that that amulet should be given to Mukunda Lal one year after her death. The \nsannyasi also said that Gyanprabha Devi’s lifespan had come to its end and that the \nillness that would befall her in the coming days would be the cause of her death. He \ncontinued and told her that Mukunda Lal would not lead a householder’s life; he would \nbecome a sannyasi and renounce worldly life, and as soon as he found his Sadguru, the \nsacred amulet would go away by itself. Because of her impending demise, Gyanprabha \nDevi became deeply concerned about who would take over the household duties of the \nfamily – hence the haste to make arrangements for her eldest son’s marriage. She wrote \ndown the words spoken by the sannyasi on a small piece of paper, very carefully placed \nthe paper and the amulet in a small closed container and kept it constantly with her. In \nCalcutta, when she saw that her time of death was approaching, she called Ananta Lal by \nher side and told him to keep this container under great care, to never open it himself, and \ngive it directly to Mukunda one year after her death. \n \n \nAttraction to the Himalayas \n \n \nAfter the loss of his mother, Mukunda Lal felt as if his world was one great void. \nHis only sanctuary was his affectionate mother’s tenderness and her incredibly beautiful \neyes – the only place of serenity and security. Losing that ever-loving one, his heart no \nlonger wanted to stay home. His spirit constantly craved to escape life in the world, and it \nwas as if the Himalayas were calling him to come. His mother had taught him to keep \nsecret within his heart his longing to lay his head at the Feet of the Universal Mother, and \nnow it seemed to him that he would find that same Universal Mother in the mountains of \nthe Himalayas. This feeling was constantly awake in him and made him restless and \nwanting to leave. He even tried to run away from home to the Himalayas and got as far as \nNainital, but he was not able to escape his eldest brother Ananta Lal’s alertness and had \nto return home from there. Still, he always felt the calling of the Himalayas within him. \n \n \nIn the Company of Saints at an Early Age \n \n \nFourteen months after their mother’s death, Ananta Lal presented Mukunda Lal \nwith the small container he had received from Gyanprabha Devi. Upon opening the box \ncontaining the amulet and reading the letter accompanying it, Mukunda was overcome. \nThe nectarous memories of his virtuous and compassionate mother flooded his eyes with \nloving tears, and having received direction at the same time from an unknown Great \nPower Who was invisibly governing his destiny of spirituality, his heart overflowed with \n13 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Fearing that he may again try to run \naway from home, they tried to keep an eye on him at all times. Regardless of this, when \nfrom time to time he would find out about some sages and saints coming nearby, \nMukunda Lal would sneak away from his family and secretly go and visit them. In order \nto satisfy Mukunda Lal’s desire to go around and see spiritual persons, Bhagabati Charan \nlet him travel to many places. One of these times, he went to Benares [Varanasi]. \nMukunda Lal was twelve years old. Bhagabati Charan had two friends in Benares, Kedar \nBabu and Swami Pranabananda Giri. Mukunda Lal stayed at Kedar Babu’s house. One \nday, Kedar Babu went to bathe in the Ganges and Mukunda Lal was visiting Swami \nPranabanandaji’s hermitage. Mukunda Lal sat in front of a meditating Pranabanandaji, \nseated in yogic posture and absorbed in Divine Ecstasy. Just a short while afterwards, \nMukunda Lal was surprised to see that Kedar Babu had left the Ganges and was coming \nin their direction. As soon as Kedar Babu came near, Mukunda Lal asked how he came \nhere so quickly, thinking that Kedar Babu would still be by the riverside. Kedar Babu \npointed to Pranabanandaji and answered that it was Swamiji himself who had come to the \nbanks of the Ganges and had asked him to come. Mukunda Lal was stupefied. Swamiji \nwas always in front of him, absorbed in meditation! When could he have gone to the \nbanks? And so, right at that early age, Mukunda Lal realized that this type of \nextraordinary act could only be performed by a great yogi. In later life as Swami \nYogananda, he would speak descriptively about this act by the miraculous power of \nPranabanandaji in many gatherings and talks around the world.* \n \n*[English Editor’s note: We were told the following rare stories about Swami \nPranabanandaji by our friend who is a direct disciple of Pranabanandaji’s eminent \ndisciple, the late Sri Jnanendra Mukhopadyay. Our friend had heard these stories direct \nfrom the mouth of the late Sri Jnanendra: \n  \nBefore Swami Pranabananda left this world he told his followers that after his death they \nshould put his body inside a trunk (box) and keep it immersed in the holy Ganges water \nfor one night and next morning they should lift the trunk and do the required formalities. \nSo accordingly the disciples put his body inside a trunk after death & locked it and tied \nthe trunk with chain so that it would not float away and immersed it in Ganges water and \nwaited throughout the night on the bank of the Ganges. The next morning they lifted out \nthe trunk and found it was still locked but yet was empty! His body was not found! His \nbody had vanished.   \n  \nSwami Pranabananda had a Siddhi (power) of producing Khichri (a mixture of rice & \npulse) as much as he wanted to. He used to cover a container with cloth then removing \nonly half portion of the cloth he used to take out ready made Khichri. When the half \nportion of khichri was finished he used to cover the empty part of the container with cloth \n& open the other half portion which was found to be filled with khichri. In this way \nalternatively the khichri was produced automatically & endlessly. That is why a lot of \n14 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

He told him to come to the \nGanga early in the morning & he will give him the siddhi & if he fails he will give it to \nthe Ganges.

If he saw any wrongdoing, he would dive into the conflict fearlessly, \nregardless of whether the opponent was more powerful. There was a particularly tough \nbully among his classmates; all of the others were terrorized by this “macho” boy.

At \nabout this time, Bhagabati Charan bought a house at No. 4 Garpar Road and became a \npermanent resident of Calcutta. Exactly opposite this house, on the south side of the \nstreet, was the Calcutta Deaf and Dumb School. The late Mohini Mohan Majumdar, the \neminent founder – and professor – of this university, lived in the residence quarters of the \nschool as the superintendent of the dormitory. His son Manomohan Majumdar was often \nwith him. Although Manomohan was five or six years younger than Mukunda Lal, a deep \nfriendship formed between them within a very short time. Manomohan was captivated \nand taken by Mukunda Lal’s natural spiritual awareness, his deep reverence for saints and \nsages and resolute aspiration to live the spiritual life. Unbeknownst to himself, \nManomohan had not only become Mukunda Lal’s friend but also his disciple and \nfollower.* Mukunda Lal did not wait long to teach everything about meditation and \nspiritual practice he had learned from his loving mother and his eldest sister Roma Devi \nto his young friend-disciple. Going together to see saints and sages, visiting Belur Math, \nDakshineshwar Temple and such holy places, meditating together, sometimes sitting \ntogether in meditative absorption in some place of solitude away from the city at night – \nall such things became a regular part of their lives. It was only natural that Mukunda Lal \ntook the position of guru. And this was somewhat true at the Hindu School as well. \nAlthough most of his classmates may not have been so spiritual-minded, many of the \nyouths of good character were attracted to Mukunda Lal and were fascinated by his \nvirtues. One among them who became particularly devoted to Mukunda Lal was Amar \nMitra of the Mitra family from Kumartoli. Even in his neighborhood in Garpar, quite a \nfew friends and relatives held Mukunda Lal in very high regard. Their reason for \nassociating with Mukunda Lal was primarily to discuss religious and spiritual things. \n \n[*Publisher's note: Manomohan Majumdar [Swami Satyananda Giri] is referred to as \nYoganandaji's disciple\" in only an informal sense. This is an expression of the deep \nrespect and love Satyanandaji held for his elder brother Yoganandaji. Satyanandaji and \nYoganandaji had not yet met their formal Guru in Kriya Yoga who was none other than \nSwami Sriyukteshvar Giri. As Satyanandaji writes in Yogananda Sanga: \n \n\"It is needless to say that because this servant [Satyanandaji] has had the company of \nSwami Sriyukteshvar Giri Maharaj, it is he [Sriyukteshvarji] who holds the place as \n'Guru Maharaj' for this servant.\" (Swami Satyananda Giri from Yogananda Sanga \nChapter 1)] \n \n \n16 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

He began to confer with his \nclosest friends about finding a way to escape to the Himalayas. \n \n \nEscaping for the Himalayas \n \n \nOne day, three young friends – Mukunda Lal, Amar Mitra and Jotin Ghosh – \nplanned to run away to Hardwar [Haridvar - in the foothills of the Himalayas]. Making up \nan excuse that they were just going for an outing in the vicinities around Calcutta, they \nwent directly to the Howrah train station instead. Remembering his brother’s alert \nwatchfulness, Mukunda Lal even made arrangements to change into different clothes \nduring their journey. Amar Mitra brought a horse-drawn carriage to Garpar, feigning that \nhe and friend Mukunda Lal were just going out and about in Calcutta; they somehow \nsecretly loaded a small-sized bundle onto the carriage as they were leaving. Jotin Ghosh \nthen joined them. So that brother Ananta Lal would not easily catch on to where they \nwere headed, they first bought tickets to Burdwan [Bardhaman – in Bengal] at the \nHowrah station. The plan was that they would get off at Burdwan and buy another set of \ntickets for Hardwar and head that way in the morning. After they reached the station in \nBurdwan, Jotin suddenly ran away as they were preparing to get tickets to Hardwar.

However, Amar and Mukunda Lal were \nsteadfast in pursuing their goal; they were going to go to Hardwar, no matter what. \nPurchasing upper class train tickets, the two of them headed towards Hardwar. When \nYoganandaji came back to India from America, Jotin-da* came to see his relative, leader \nand friend from their adolescent years. After sharing heartfelt greetings and joyful \nembraces, at one point, Jotin-da stretched out on Swamiji’s bed and Swamiji humorously \nrecounted the story of that secret adventure. As Swamiji descriptively spoke about Jotin-\nda’s “act of fear” and running back home, Jotin-da also laughed and joined in on this \njocularity. Swamiji was yelping out in laughter and trying to “pull Jotin-da’s leg.” That \nwas a wonderful scene to behold. \n \n[*Translator’s note: The Bengali suffix “da” - literally meaning “elder brother” - is often \nused to denote a sign of casual respect and is not restricted to family members only. \n“Babu” and “Mahasaya” are the Bengali adjuncts for addressing someone more \nformally.] \n \n \nBhagabati Charan and Ananta Lal became deeply worried as Mukunda had not \nreturned home. Everyone was full of anxiety at Amar Mitra’s house as well. News of this \nwas spread out; the police were also informed. Ananta Lal did not take long to figure out \nthat they may be traveling to Hardwar. Information about them were given to the police \nnetworks covering India and the police were now allowed to arrest them and bring them \nback. Mukunda and Amar had already assumed that this type of thing may happen and \nthey were prepared to fool the police as well. They had taken Western clothes with them \nin their bundle and had changed into them during the journey. When the train reached the \nMogulsarai Junction, a police officer spotted them and began to ask questions. The \nfearless Amar Mitra convinced the officer that one of them was named “Thomas” and the \nother “Thompson”. Not only was the officer satisfied with this answer, he actually \napologized to the young gentlemen for disturbing them and asked for their forgiveness. \nBut this tactic did not work in Hardwar. As they disembarked at the station, they were \nboth immediately taken by the waiting police to the station master’s office. Within two \ndays, Ananta Lal and Amar Mitra’s elder brother arrived, ready to take their brothers back \nhome. Amar agreed to return without much hesitation but Mukunda protested heavily. In \nthe end, both had to go back to Calcutta with their elder brothers. Father Bhagabati \nCharan’s agonizing anxiety was finally quelled. And this time, Bhagabati Charan gave \nstrict orders to Mukunda Lal that he must promise not to leave home until he at least \npassed his Entrance Exams. However, the habit of being with sages and running to see \nsadhus and yogis as soon as he would hear of their proximity never stopped - still eluding \nAnanta Lal’s watchful eyes. \n \n \n \nAt this time, there were two places to which Mukunda Lal went - almost as a \nregular discipline: Belur Math with his companions and friends, and No. 50 Amherst \nStreet, the residence of “Master Mahasaya” Sri Mahendra Nath Gupta, also known as Sri \n“M” - the author of the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. Swami Prajnananda - or “Rakhal \nMaharaj” - who was the president of the Sri Ramakrishna Mission, loved Mukunda Lal \nvery much. Whenever Mukunda Lal would go to the Belur Math, Swamiji would call him \nover and affectionately say, “Mukunda is ‘our’ boy.” To go and see Sri “M” in the \n18 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

First, Sri “M”s residence was not very far \nfrom Garpar Road, but besides that, there was something else that drew Mukunda to that \nplace. His beloved mother had drawn her last breath in an apartment they were renting in \nthat very building. Mukunda Lal experienced several spiritually revelatory experiences \nwith Sri “M” and because of this he revered Sri “M” like his guru. He had even \nbeseeched Sri “M” to please accept him as a disciple. Once he had made the same request \nto Rakhal Maharaj as well. But both of them gave Mukunda Lal the same answer, “I am \nnot your guru. Your guru is coming. You will have him very soon.” \n \n \nA little while after settling permanently in Calcutta, Bhagabati Charan retired \nfrom governmental service. During the term of his employment, word had spread to \neminent trading companies and railway services about his management and accounting \nskills, and the executives of these firms held him in very high regard. It was heard that he \nhad masterfully and swiftly resolved a heavy financial burden that had been outstanding \nfor many years in the Eastern Bengal Railway Company. In those days, all of the rail \ncompanies in India were run by British firms. After thirty years of straight service in \ngovernmental work, when Bhagabati Charan began to receive his pension upon reaching \nthe age of fifty and retired from that work, the Bengal Nagpur Railway immediately \nenlisted his services in a high and powerful position in their company. He became the \nP.A. (personal assistant) of the Company Agent. The “Agent” of a British company was \nthe executive in charge of every facet of the entire enterprise, and being his P.A. meant \nreceiving exceptional financial remuneration as well as power. It was actually the P.A. \nthat carried out the daily responsibilities of the Agent. In those days, it was virtually \nunthinkable for an Indian to reach such a position at a British company; it is not difficult \nto surmise the level of respect this drew from society. Bhagabati Charan held this position \nfor many years. \n \n \nBeing in the Company of Acharya Shastri Mahasaya \n \n \nAt the time of the “Himalayan escape,” Mukunda Lal’s home tutor was a \nrespectable man of erudition named Rakhal Kabiraj. Although he was not a spiritual \npractitioner [sadhak], he often engaged the spiritually inclined Mukunda Lal in \ndiscussions about many aspects of philosophy and spiritual teachings. After Mukunda \nLal’s flight towards the mountains, Ananta Lal firmly concluded that it was this elderly \nSri Kabiraj Mahasaya who was the cause of this; talking about nothing but spiritual and \nphilosophical things all the time corrupted his brother’s mind. It was decided that he \nshould no longer be kept as home tutor. He was replaced by an ordinary-looking, soft-\nspoken teacher from the Metropolitan High School named Sri Ashutosh Shastri. It was \nnot possible to guess from this man’s demeanor that he was a scholar of the highest level. \nFurthermore, Ananta Lal did not have the slightest inkling of Shastri Mahasaya’s \nimmensely advanced stage of spirituality. He could not imagine in any way at the depths \nof water in which this “fish” swam, and ironically it was in the waters that Ananta Lal \nfeared in the first place. How could he have known that in trying to rescue him from \nspirituality that he would actually be handing his spiritually mad brother over to a \n“spiritual bandit”?! By the time Ananta Lal realized that not only did his father Bhagabati \n19 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

This new teacher Ashutosh Shastri Mahasaya was not just a \ndisciple of Yogiraj Shayama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya; he was an eminently advanced \nKriya Yogi and yoga-guru. Thus, what happens when like minds meet began to happen. \nIn the name of academic studies, the teaching of Kriya Yoga and its practice went on \nbehind closed doors. And the study and analysis of the meanings of the Gita and other \nsuch essential scriptures also went on as an adjunct. Mukunda Lal was extremely happy \nthat together they were finally able to evade his brother’s sentry-like watch. \n \n \nIt is at this time that Mukunda Lal’s training in spiritual work began. The \nassociation with Manomohan Majumdar has already been mentioned. Now, joining him \nwere schoolmate Upendra Nath Mitra from Garpar, Tulsi Narayan Basu (the son of the \nprincipal of the Calcutta Art School, Sri Hari Narayan Basu) and Jitendra Lal Majumdar \nwho was studying at the Herr School and was of the same age as Mukunda Lal. There \nwas a young admirer-friend of Tulsi Narayan named Prakash Chandra Das, who was \nmuch younger than Tulsi Narayan. Prakash Chandra’s family was deeply involved with \nthe newly founded Brahmo Samaj; he was very intelligent and sharp in mind. He also \ncame with Tulsi Narayan and joined this congregation from time to time. Jitendra Nath’s \nfather was an eminent businessman in the paper industry in Calcutta; he was known to \nhave only traveled in trams and buses until his personal net worth had accumulated to at \nleast 100,000 rupees. It was only after he attained this goal that he purchased a car. Of \ncourse “car” in those days meant horse-drawn carriages – Landau carriages; the practice \nof driving automobiles had not become that prevalent yet. He also had a palatial mansion \nbuilt on Rani Swarnamayi Road. Eldest son Upendra Lal Majumdar was the heir to his \nfather’s business. Jitendra Lal, fair in complexion, was very attractive physically and in \nbehavior as well. Mukunda Lal’s brothers and sisters were all very drawn to fair-skinned \nboys and girls. Although every one of them had inherited their mother’s wondrously \nbeautiful eyes, all of them were basically dark in complexion. Perhaps one reason for \nMukunda Lal’s exceptional love for Jitendra Lal was because of the color of his skin. It \nwas at Upendra Nath Mitra’s house that Mukunda Lal began his regular gatherings of \nspiritual discussions. Of course, Manomohan was there, following like a shadow, and the \nabove-mentioned new friends also began to join in. Among them, Tulsi Narayan was \nparticularly drawn to Belur Math. As the number of friends continued to grow, the place \nof congregation was moved to a one-storey house adjoining Tulsi Narayan’s family \nhome. \n \n \nLoved and Blessed by Sri “M” \n \n \nIt has been previously mentioned that Mukunda Lal spent time with Master \nMahasaya Mahendra Nath Gupta every day. It has also been stated that Mukunda Lal had \nhad certain supernatural experiences with him. A couple of such incidents are being put to \npaper here, as heard by this writer directly from Yoganandaji’s own mouth. One day, \nsometime around midday, Mukunda went to Master Mahasaya’s residence; possibly it \nwas a holiday. Master Mahasaya was not in his room. Mukunda looked out and saw that \n20 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Mukunda quickly ran to him and with great curiosity \nasked, “Master Mahasaya! Who are you talking to?” Without returning any answer \nwhatsoever, Master Mahasaya continued to look up at the sky and laugh and laugh. \nMukunda’s curiosity was fueled even more, and with a beseeching tone of voice, he \nasked again, “Who are you talking to? Won’t you please tell me? Please, won’t you tell \nme?” Master Mahasaya had had great affection for this dear child. Eventually, he turned \nto Mukunda and, completely astonishing him, said, “With Mother.” Mukunda’s \nexcitement intensified even more: “I also want to see Mother! And talk to Her!” As \nMukunda continued to beg and demand for this to happen, Master Mahasaya finally said, \n“It will happen later.” With uncontrollable eagerness Mukunda Lal asked, “When will it \nhappen?” The answer was again, “Later.” From this point on, every single day, Mukunda \nwould ask Master Mahasaya, “Won’t you please tell me, when it will happen?” And he \nhad to hear the same answer every day, “Later.” \n \n[*Translator’s note: Rooftops in India are, in most cases, habitable and with a protective \nwall surrounding the edges of the roof.] \n \n \nIn the meantime, dodging his brother’s watch, Mukunda would sit for meditation \nevery day at dusk in their house’s storage room. One day, his mind became very absorbed \nas he was meditating, and a short while after that he had a vision of the Goddess Kali. His \nheart danced with joy. But he kept this experience completely to himself. Next afternoon, \nas was his daily ritual to do so, he went to see Master Mahasaya. And immediately upon \nseeing him, Mukunda again asked in that pleading tone of voice, “Every day you say ‘it \nwill happen later, it will happen later, it will happen later.’ But why don’t you tell me \nwhen it will happen?” Master Mahasaya did not answer back. Mukunda again said \ninsistently, “Is this how sadhus are? You give your word and you don’t keep it! All you \nsay is ‘it will happen later!’” Then Master Mahasaya grinned and said, “Are you being \nmischievous or what?” Mukunda said, “What mischief? You gave your word that you \nwill show me Mother. Where have you kept your word?” Master Mahasaya looked \ndirectly into his eyes and spoke out, “Why – oh about eight o’clock or so last night? In \nthe storage room?” As soon as Mukunda Lal heard this, he fell and hugged Master \nMahasaya’s feet. Master Mahasaya lifted him up in loving embrace. \n \n \nFirst Uses of Mental Power \n \n \nThere was an incident that Mukunda Lal caused which was associated with his \nsecretly meditating every day in the storage room. From his very birth, he was the \npossessor of an extraordinary ability. Sometimes certain statements would spring forth \nfrom him that would unfailingly come true. During childhood when his family was living \nin Northwest India, a boil appeared on his sister Uma Devi’s foot one day. As she was \nnursing it by applying balm on it, Mukunda Lal showed up from somewhere and started \nto massage the same balm on his own hand. Uma Devi yelled at him, to which Mukunda \nLal said, “Look sister. Tomorrow this boil you have will grow twice its size and a boil \nwill appear on my hand here.” The regular bickering between these two close siblings \n21 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

But the next day, Uma Devi’s boil really did grow twice its \nsize, causing her pain as well, and a boil appeared on Mukunda’s hand. Mother \nGyanprabha Devi was well aware of these “qualities” of her son. She tried to reason with \nMukunda that one should not cause other people this kind of pain. There was a also \nsimilar incident of will power associated with his meditating in the storage room. This \ntype of power was demonstrated by him many times in later life; this writer himself has \ndirectly witnessed it. Only the Oriya* cook of the house knew about his secret meditation \nsittings in the storage space. One day, the cook more or less jokingly said, “See here \n‘middle sir’. I will tell ‘big sir’ about your hiding around and meditating in the storage \nroom.” “Big sir” was Ananta Lal. It was wholly disagreeable to Mukunda Lal that his \ndaily spiritual duty would come to an end; he became very angry upon hearing this type \nof threat. But controlling himself, he simply said, “Look. If I wish, your hand will be \nstuck to the wall.” The cook challenged him, “Let’s see how you can do that!” Mukunda \nLal took the cook’s left palm and put it up against the wall, kept it extended from his \nbody, and counted “1,2,3,4,5,6” and immediately, the cook’s hand became locked to the \nwall. He could not pull himself off no matter how much he tried. He begged, “Sir, please \nrelease my hand!” Mukunda said, “Stand here just like this. This is your punishment.” \nAnd then he went out to play with his mates and forgot about the whole thing. Panchakoti \n[the cook] was in a sense “handcuffed” to the wall. Gradually, evening came. The work in \nthe kitchen area was completely at a standstill. People in the household also started to \nwonder where their cook was; finally they were astounded to find him standing there in \nthat condition. The cook tearfully said that it was “middle sir” who had put him in this \npredicament. The news went to Bhagabati Charan. Upon coming there and seeing this \nsituation, he cried out, “Where is that dastardly son of mine?” Right at that time, \nMukunda Lal returned home. Suddenly he remembered what he had left behind. He ran \nto the cook, touched his hand and the hand was free. The cook fell to Mukunda Lal’s feet, \nbegged forgiveness and said that he would never again try to do anything against him. \nMukunda replied in a reproaching tone, “You won’t ever do this again, right?” The cook \npulled his ears in a gesture of being ashamed and said that he would never do it again. \nThe members of the household were stupefied by this whole happening, and they all \nbreathed a collective sigh of relief after it was over. In 1935, when Yoganandaji had \nreturned from America he recounted this story to us one day, and no one could help \nlaughing at his descriptive telling of it, imitating the cook and his condition. \n \n[*Translator’s note: “Oriya” - person from the province of Orissa.] \n \n \nThe days passed on like this, but at the same time, the Entrance Exams were fast \napproaching. Mukunda Lal’s schoolmates were working diligently at preparing for the \ntests. But he was “treading in deep waters.” Where’s the time to study when you’re \nconsumed with spiritual practice and spending time with saints and sages? He would \nhave been very happy to not have to sit for the exams at all, but then again, he had \npromised his father that he would forsake his desire to leave home until he at least took \nthe exams. So, there was no way out. He had to sit for the tests. Mukunda Lal thought \nabout things for a while and decided that he would take the help of a fellow schoolmate \nwho lived in their very neighborhood – a very good student. As soon as he requested this \nschoolmate to help him, the boy immediately agreed and happily promised to help in any \n22 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Mukunda went to his house every day with all of his schoolbooks and such. \nLaboring incessantly, he felt at one point that he had made some sort of progress in \npreparing for the tests. In due time, the exams were held. When the results were \nannounced, it was seen that somehow, by some kind of grace, Mukunda Lal actually \npassed the Entrance Exams. Now the waves of renunciation again began to sway his \nentire being. But because of his schoolmates and his father’s insistence, he enrolled in the \nMetropolitan College. But can one who is a “wild bird” at heart ever be happy in a cage? \nHis spirit cried out within, “Run! Run!” And right at this time, he was blessed with yet \nanother wondrous supernatural experience with Master Mahasaya. \n \n \nRevelation of the Divine through Sri “M” \n \n \nAs was his regular routine, Mukunda went to Master Mahasaya’s residence one \nafternoon. On this day Master Mahasaya was getting ready to go out. After he got dressed \nhe said to Mukunda Lal, “Come. Let’s go to the cinema.” Mukunda immediately agreed. \nIt wasn’t that the cinema was of much interest; he simply wanted to spend time with \nMaster Mahasaya. They went out to the street and took a horse-drawn taxi. The cab had \ntwo long seats that faced each other and it was quite comfortable to travel in these \ncarriages. Master Mahasaya and Mukunda Lal sat side by side in the seat facing the front. \nOn the way Master Mahasaya spoke about many spiritual things and of course, Mukunda \nwas elated out of his head at this. After going a little distance, an elderly gentleman saw \nthem and shouted out, “O Master Mahasaya! Where are you going? Stop, stop! I’ll join \nyou!” Without any way out of this, they had to stop the carriage; this gentleman got into \nthe cab and sat in the facing seat. He began to speak about many things about regular \nworldly life. Mukunda Lal became quite irritated inside. They were having a conversation \nabout such nice things and this man came and ruined everything. At that time, the \ncarriage was trotting through Cornwalis Street. Master Mahasaya leaned over to \nMukunda’s ear and whispered, “You don’t like this – hm? You see that lamp post ahead? \nAs soon as we reach there this man will get out of the car.” Just as the carriage reached \nthe spot by the lamp post, the man suddenly cried out, “Stop the car! I left something at \nhome! I have to get off!” The carriage was immediately stopped and the gentleman left. \nRelieved, Mukunda resumed his conversation with Master Mahasaya. When the carriage \nwas passing by the University Senate House, they saw that there was some sort of \nconference taking place there; many people had gathered. Master Mahasaya had the \ncarriage stopped, took Mukunda by the hand and said, “Come. Let’s go and hear what is \nbeing said at this meeting.” They found two seats next to each other in the hall and began \nto listen to the lecture that was going on. Mukunda was getting completely annoyed at \nhaving to listen to the talk, and right at this time Master Mahasaya said, “You don’t like \nthis, hm? In just a little while all the lights will go out and we’ll sneak out of here.” Just a \nfew moments later, suddenly the lights all went out, and the hall was filled with the \nyelling and screaming of the audience. Master Mahasaya grabbed Mukunda’s hand and \nsaid, “Ok, this is our chance. Come on, let’s get out of here.” As soon as they both got out \nof the hall, they saw that all of the lights had come back on inside. They went down the \nstairs and on to the sidewalk. After walking a little distance to the place where the Herr \nstatue stood, Master Mahasaya stopped in front of the statue and said, “So, we didn’t get \n23 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

He could see everything and on all sides. He could even see inside \nthe trees and the fluids they were drawing from the earth. He did not remember for how \nlong this state lasted. When Master Mahasaya again touched his body, Mukunda Lal \nfinally came back to body-consciousness. Saying, “So now that we’ve seen the cinema, \nlet’s go home,” Master Mahasaya began to turn back. Overcome with reverence, love and \ngratitude, Mukunda fell and embraced Master Mahasaya’s feet. Again he asked to be \ntaken as a disciple. The Shakti-endowed sadhak Master Mahasaya answered, “I’m not \nyour guru. He will be coming into your life very soon.” \n \n \nSecond Escape from Home and Finding Sadguru \n \n \nA short while after enrolling in college, Mukunda Lal determined within himself \nthat enough had been done in this area, no more; now it was time to go out to find \nSadguru. And he did just that, taking with him his companion and follower-disciple \nJitendra Lal Majumdar; he said nothing of this to his father. Mukunda Lal decided that he \nwould first go to Benares, practice sadhana there and search for his guru. So one day, the \ntwo friends quietly set forth towards Benares, and Mukunda Lal took the small container \nwith the amulet from the unknown sage that his mother had passed on to him. They had \nno idea where they would go in Benares, where they would stay – nothing. They \nwandered around. Fortunately they came upon a chance meeting with Paramhansa Swami \nJnanananda, the head sannyasi [monk] of a spiritual center called “Bharat Dharma \nMahamandal.” Upon seeing these two youths – not yet adults - dressed in garb associated \nwith celibates, Jnanananda Maharaj surmised that they must have run away from home to \nbecome sadhus. After questioning them, he found that his supposition was correct, and \nfinding out that they had no place to stay in Benares, he took them in to stay at his \nashram. At the ashram, Jnananandaji let them know clearly that the life of a sannyasi is \nextremely difficult; one has to prepare oneself for that way of life. He proposed that they \nstay at the ashram for sadhana, devotional service and scriptural study and that he would \nmake them fit for the renunciate way of life. Mukunda took a liking to this mahatma. He \nwas overjoyed at having a separate cottage at the ashram. He began to practice sadhana \nwith his whole being, but he also had to perform other ashramic duties. Others in the \nashram berated him for his obsession with sadhana. All the things of daily life he had \nabandoned to come here for sannyas - he had to do the same tasks, and also lowly tasks \nthat he did not ever have to do at home! And on top of that, Mukunda Lal could not \ntolerate sentiments of disregard for meditative practices. No. He determined he had to \nleave this ashram too. One day, Mukunda Lal was sent to the market with a co-worker to \npurchase some things for the ashram. As they walked along in the streets of Benares, on \nthe opposite side of an intersection of two roads, he saw a tall, majestic sage, with long, \nflowing hair, coming towards him from the other road. There was a momentary \ndistraction in the bustle of the crowd at the intersection, but as Mukunda looked again, he \nsaw that the saint was looking steadily at him. Immediately upon seeing his gaze, \nMukunda began to feel an intense magnetic pull towards the sage. Mukunda continued to \nwalk in the direction he was walking, but as he looked again, the sage was standing there \n24 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 26, "text": " \nand still looking unwaveringly at him. In a few moments, Mukunda was out of the sage’s \nsight, but it seemed that his feet would no longer move; they did not want to keep going \nin that direction any more. The image of that sadhu at the intersection seemed to take \nover his mind and heart and he could not think of anything else. He gave the money for \nthe market to the person accompanying him, turned and moved quickly back towards that \nintersection. He saw that the sage was still standing in that same spot he had seen him \nbefore. Shouting “Gurudev! Gurudev!” Mukunda ran to the saint and fell at his feet. The \nsaint picked him up, embraced him and said, “Thou hast come at last my boy!”* \nAlthough not introduced yet in this life, they had known each other since time \nimmemorial – tied together by one string. That mysterious sage was Swami \nSriyukteshvar Giri himself, Mukunda Lal’s destined Sadguru. With great love and \naffection, Sriyukteshvarji took Mukunda Lal to his Ranamahal residence. After they \nspoke for a while, Sriyukteshvarji came to know that Mukunda Lal was his guru-brother \n[fellow disciple of the same guru] Bhagabati Charan’s son, and how and why Mukunda \nhad come to Benares and all such things. Mukunda Lal beseeched him to please initiate \nhim, receive him as his disciple and make him a sannyasi. Swamiji Maharaj assured him \nthat initiation would certainly happen now, but this was not yet the time for sannyas. \nMukunda had to finish other necessary work before taking sannyas; he had to receive a \nuniversity degree first. Mukunda Lal did not like this proposition at all; he was \ndetermined that he had to become a sannyasi now; this is why he had left home and come \nhere. Swamiji Maharaj said, “You have to become great. Of course you’ll be a sannyasi \nbut what will you be able to do by being a little weakling baba [sage]? You have to \nbecome like Swami Vivekananda. It is for this reason that you have to get a B.A. degree.” \nThe example of Swami Vivekananda stirred Mukunda’s heart, because in those days all \nspiritual-minded, patriotic Indian youths’ ideal was Mother India’s valiant son Swami \nVivekananda. Nevertheless, Mukunda again requested sannyas right then. He felt \nhesitation in going back and admitting defeat, after having left all of the complications of \nhouse and home. Sriyukteshvarji assured him that he would write to Mukunda’s father \nand explain everything. Thus it was set that Mukunda would return home, go back to \ncollege and visit Sriyukteshvarji at Serampore [Srirampur]. Mukunda Lal went back to \nthe Bharat Dharma Mahamandal ashram and told his friend Jitendra Lal about all that had \nhappened and said, “Now we’re free from here. Let’s go home.” He opened the container \ngiven by his mother and saw that the amulet was gone; it had done its work and had gone \nback to its original abode, evidencing that he had not made a mistake in recognition; he \ntruly had found his Sadguru. Before going to Calcutta, first they went to Ananta Lal’s \nhome in Agra, where he had relocated from Calcutta. Ananta Lal again rebuked his \nspiritually-mad brother, but his brother remained unmoved, saying, “All is possible by \nGod’s Grace.” After arguing with him, Mukunda Lal made a bet with his brother and \nwithout taking a single penny, Mukunda and Jiten left for Vrindavan, and they toured \nVrindavan in princely fashion and came back to Agra. Even the unbelieving Ananta Lal \nwas astounded by this. Mukunda and Jiten then headed straight for Calcutta from Agra. \n \n[*Translator's note: The statement within quotation marks is written in English in the \noriginal manuscript.] \n \n \nUpon returning to Calcutta, instead of going back to the Metropolitan College, \n25 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 27, "text": " \nMukunda Lal enrolled in the Scottish Church College. One day soon after this, he went to \nSwamiji Maharaj Sriyukteshvar Giriji in Serampore and received initiation from him into \nthe practice of Kriya Yoga in the traditional way. Having fulfilled the greatest desire of \nthe heart – having one’s Sadguru – Mukunda Lal busied himself in his college studies as \ninstructed by Sri Guru. However it was spiritual work that received more of his attention \nalthough he managed to be regularly present in class with books and papers. Whenever he \nfound an opportunity, he would run to Sri Guru at Serampore. Mukunda Lal was a natural \nleader; thus within a short time, college-mates oriented towards higher things began to \ngather around and follow him. Manomohan Majumdar and the other follower-friends \npreviously mentioned were of course there, but now there were new friends with spiritual \ninclinations. Among them was Basu Kumar Bagchi, the son of P.M. Bagchi from \nShantipur of the Nadia district. Seeing Mukunda Lal’s ever-joyful behavior, genuine \naffection towards friends, deep longing to live the spiritual life, intense devotion to Sri \nGuru and the great beings of the guru-parampara [spiritual lineage], and sometimes \nbearing witness to his extra-rational powers in certain situations, Mukunda Lal’s friends \nand companions wholly took him up as their leader. Not only did the gatherings of \nspiritual discussions go on just as before, but visiting Sri Guru Maharaj with one or two \nfriends at a time also became a regular thing. Mukunda Lal dove deeply into long \nsessions of Kriya sadhana; constantly with him like a shadow was Manomohan and now \nBasu Kumar as the third close-companion. Mukunda Lal taught Kriya to Manomohan \nand Basu Kumar. From very early on in childhood, Mukunda Lal was devoted to Mother \nKali as his Divine Supreme Goddess; after his birth-mother passed away, he saw her as \nbeing one with the Divine Mother and received great energy and uplift from Her in that \nway. The other godman in his life was Paramguru Thakur [Lord] Sri Sri Shyama Charan \nLahiri Mahasaya. The Universal Mother, Paramguru, and his own guru were the \nhelmspersons of his life, the fulfillers of his destiny and his Supreme Shelter. \n \n \nStudying at College and Being in the Company of Sri Guru \n \n \nIt has already been mentioned that Mukunda tried to be present in class as much \nas possible. However, he always looked for an excuse to go to Serampore. His uncle \n[younger brother of his father] Sri Sarada Charan Ghosh, a prominent man in the field of \nlaw, lived in Serampore as a highly respected member of the community. Thus, when it \nwas necessary, there was no problem with Mukunda’s staying overnight in that town. In \nany case, most of the time he stayed with Sri Guru himself. Whenever he would learn any \nnew wisdom or process regarding sadhana, he would return to Calcutta and teach these \nthings to the disciple-like Manomohan and Basu Kumar. In this way, his role as a teacher \nwent on unabated. They regularly practiced Kriya, meditation and contemplation \ntogether. Although Manomohan had known Mukunda longer than Basu Kumar, he was \nthe youngest of the three. Basu Kumar was not only of the same age as Mukunda Lal, he \nwas a schoolmate in the same class-year, highly intelligent, energetic and physically very \nhandsome. Gradually, Basu Kumar became Mukunda Lal’s favored one; it can even be \nsaid that they were seen by others as inseparable. Manomohan remained as part of the \ntriumvirate but he was considered third in the hierarchy. Mukunda Lal became very \ndrawn to Basu Kumar and Basu Kumar’s influence also began to show on him.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 28, "text": " \nit can be said that Mukunda Lal became more or less mesmerized with Basu Kumar’s \npresence. He also took both Basu Kumar and Manomohan many times to guru \nSriyukteshvarji. Gurudev was well aware of the relationships between the three of them. \nMukunda Lal was extremely feeling-oriented, a vessel of love, uncomplicated, a natural \nsadhak and mad for spirituality; Basu Kumar was steady, stoic, renunciate, analytical and \nintellectual; Manomohan was also feeling-oriented, uncomplicated and renunciate and \nMukunda Lal’s shadow-like follower. Although Mukunda Lal was very close to Basu \nKumar, it seems that he would sometimes say, “You [Basu Kumar] are extremely ‘dry’! It \nis with Manomohan that my destiny lies.” The writer heard this directly from Swami \nSatyanandaji’s mouth. Also, Gurudev Sriyukteshvarji did not like Mukunda Lal’s \nexcessive closeness with Basu Kumar, and Mukunda Lal was aware of this himself. For \nthis reason, whenever he had to carry out a task that he knew would not be looked upon \nfavorably by Gurudev but had to do it because of Basu Kumar’s persistent insistence, he \nwould try to do it without Gurudev knowing about it. But nothing remained hidden to his \nomniscient Gurudev, especially when it concerned his Spirit-intoxicated Mukunda, \nhumanity’s son.

However, some of the times he would go without telling his \nGurudev, and when this would happen, Mukunda Lal would approach Sri Guru with \ntrepidation, fearing that Gurudev may admonish him for his actions. But when it came to \nthese matters, Gurudev never showed any signs of disapproval; instead, he behaved in a \ncompletely nonchalant manner, as if nothing had happened. Because of this Mukunda’s \nreverence and devotion towards his Gurudev grew tremendously. The feeling of wanting \nto escape to the Himalayas still had not abated in him completely, but his heart did not \nwant to leave his guru’s side. Once he actually had asked permission from Sri Guru to go \nto the Himalayas; Gurudev neither forbade him nor outwardly expressed anything \naffirmative. At this time, Mukunda Lal did go away to have audience with a holy sage, \nbut not in the Himalayas; it was in a village near Tarakeshvar, where he went to see Sri \nSri Ram Gopal Majumdar of Ranarajpur. That was a wondrous experience for Mukunda \nLal. He had heard about the advanced yogic achievements of the sage of Ranarajpur from \nhis Sanskrit professor at Scottish Church College. This great yogi-saint was an eminent \ndisciple of Yogiraj Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasaya. Mukunda Lal felt that instead of going to the \nHimalayas, it was more important to go and see this great being. Determined to find him, \none day he took a train to the Tarakeshvar station. Ranarajpur was a few miles farther via \na footpath. After asking around a bit, he began walking on that path. Everyone had said \nthat it would be best to try to reach the village by nightfall. But no matter how far he \nwent, when he would ask the passersby, they would tell him that he still had the same \ndistance to go as he was told previously. The sense of distance in rural peoples – as far as \nmiles and furlongs and such – is often very unreliable. Those who have traveled in the \njungle areas of Chota Rampur – at least during the time before Independence – know this \nto be true. [Translator’s note: Sri Sailendra Bejoy Dasgupta gives examples of confusing \nideas of distance that are typical of the rural folk mentality in Bengal. Because of the \ncolloquial terms used in this segment, the translator has tried to reword this segment in a \nway that can be understood by international readers. This segment is set off by “+” signs \nat its beginning and end.] + One mile remains “just a mile” even after traversing five \nmiles. This is why experienced travelers of the jungle area sarcastically call “a mile” the \n“broken-branch mile.” When one breaks off a young and thin branch from a tree and \nwalks until the leaves become dry – until this time has passed one has not crossed the \njungle’s “just a mile” distance. + Mukunda Lal’s situation was somewhat like this. He \nhad been walking and walking, and evening was approaching, but he still had far to go \nbefore he would reach his destination. On top of this, he eventually found out that he was \nnow traveling for a good long while on the wrong road, and the village was actually very \nfar from where he had ended up at this point. Night was falling; there was not a soul \naround. What would he do now? Fortunately, he saw a bullock cart at a distance. \nMukunda Lal approached the driver of the cart and asked him about some possible \nlodging for the night. The driver took pity on the young man and made arrangements for \nMukunda Lal to spend the night at his home, which was a short distance from where they \nmet. The next morning, after receiving directions to Ranarajpur once more, he again set \nout with haste. The sun was rising higher and higher in the sky; there was nothing but \ndesolate countryside all around; Ranarajpur was still “a long way, over on the other side.” \nWhen the sun was directly above his head and Mukunda Lal could barely keep going \nwith heat, hunger, thirst and exhaustion, he saw a man far away who seemed to be \n28 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

As the man came closer, upon seeing his radiant, \nmeditative and yogic eyes Mukunda Lal knew instantly that this stranger was Sri Ram \nGopal Majumdar himself. After introductions and ceremonially taking the dust off of the \nsage’s feet, Mukunda Lal followed the saint and finally reached his destination. The \nShakti-endowed yogi must have come to know through his yogic powers that a young \nKriya yogi-sadhak was coming to see him and was suffering on the road after going in \nthe wrong direction. The residence of Ram Gopalji was nothing but a little hut with palm \nleaves for a roof. The room was more or less bare; there was a blanket for sleeping, a seat \non the floor for meditation and a few utensils for cooking. Immediately upon their arrival, \nSri Ram Gopal made Mukunda a drink of sweetened lime juice and water, relieving his \nthirst and tiredness. Later he prepared some “khichuri” [blend of rice and pulse] by his \nown hands and satisfied Mukunda’s hunger. Sri Ram Gopal spread out a blanket for \nMukunda and told him to get some sleep. But sleep would not come. He kept seeing a \nradiant glow all around, whether it was with his eyes closed or open, but there was no \nlighted lamp. Sometime in the deep night the great sage said, “Now go to sleep.” \nMukunda did then go to sleep, but Ram Gopalji remained seated on his meditation seat. \nIn the morning, when Mukunda was bidding farewell, Sri Ram Gopal asked Mukunda to \nstand in front of him for a short while, and then they took their goodbyes. Mukunda Lal \nsuddenly realized that within this momentary period, a pain that he had had in his back \nfor quite a long time had instantly vanished. Later, Mukunda Lal came to find out that Sri \nRam Gopal lived for many years without sleep; he was absorbed in meditation almost \nceaselessly. \n \n \nAfter returning home, Mukunda Lal went to see Sri Guru in Serampore at the first \nopportunity he got, but with some fear, because Sri Guru had not outwardly given him \npermission to go away. However, when they met, Gurudev welcomed Mukunda in his \nusual affectionate manner. And Gurudev also expressed joy upon hearing Mukunda’s \ndescriptive telling of his experience with Sri Ram Gopal Majumdar in Ranarajpur. \n \n \nExperiencing Sri Guru’s Divine Grace in Puri \n \n \nIn the following year, when college was on hiatus during the holy holiday season, \nMukunda Lal spent practically the entire holiday with Gurudev in his Puri ashram. This \nwas the first time he had spent this amount of uninterrupted time with his guru. During \nthis period, Mukunda Lal bore direct witness to Gurudev’s unimaginable yogic powers \nand the unfathomable depths of his wisdom. Among many divine and supernatural \nexperiences, one particular event seems appropriate to elucidate here. While Mukunda \nLal stayed with Gurudev, he had a great deal of time and opportunity available – \nmorning, dusk, night – for the regular practice of Kriya Yoga, deep meditation and \nsadhana. One late afternoon, when Mukunda Lal had sat for meditation, Gurudev called \nhim from the veranda. At first, Mukunda Lal did not want to get up from his seat of \nmeditation. He heard the voice of Gurudev again, this time far more severe. He quickly \ngot up and went and stood before his guru on the veranda. Gurudev immediately touched \nhim on the forehead and chest and Mukunda Lal lost all physical consciousness. It \nseemed that he had become one with the Infinite.

This was an \nincredible, indescribable experience. He had no knowledge of the amount of time that \nhad passed while he was in this state. When Gurudev again touched his forehead and \nchest, he returned to his normal state of consciousness. Overcome with reverence, \ndevotion and gratitude, Mukunda Lal was about to fall in full prostration at his guru’s \nfeet, when he heard Sriyukteshvarji’s stern order, “Go quickly and sweep the veranda. \nThen we must take a walk by the seaside.” Mukunda Lal was heartbroken when he heard \nthis. In place of expressing his being overcome with devotion at his guru’s feet was now \nthis order to do something as mundane as sweeping! Even in 1935, when Yoganandaji \ndescribed this event, he still could not hide his heartbrokenness of that time. Who knows \n- perhaps this was the type of discipline he needed. Perhaps this type of dry physical task \nwas assigned so that this ecstatically prone “child of humanity” would not float away \nwith the buoyancy of Divine Ecstasy and forget the mundane. Among all of the disciples, \nMukunda Lal was exceptional in that he was witness to more of the rare outward \nexpressions of Gurudev’s tender heart. About this, the world-conquering Swami \nYogananda said later, “I have never seen a more wise and powerful yogi such as Swamiji \n[Sriyukteshvarji], but if he had just showed a little more of the loving feeling and \nsweetness in his heart, it would have been so nice. He was a bit too tough in his ways.” \nAs Mukunda Lal held Sriyukteshvarji in the highest spiritual place, he feared Gurudev \nterribly when it came to practical matters of daily life. His behavior towards Gurudev \nalways was like that of a child, even after Yoganandaji attained worldwide eminence. At \nthe time when Yoganandaji stayed in India during the years 1935-36, this writer himself \nwas a direct witness to Yoganandaji’s “desperate” condition; like a schoolboy who had \ncome to his teacher without having studied, he would sit in front of Sriyukteshvarji in this \nkind of apprehensive state. In any case – with the regular company of Gurudev, the \npractice of Kriya Yoga, meditation, devotionals, spiritual discussions, being guru-like for \nhis friends and follower-companions, and sometimes playing hooky from school for these \nreasons – the days moved forward like this. The I.A. examinations were soon \napproaching, but Mukunda Lal had not prepared at all for the tests. Where was the time – \nor desire – to read and study? All of his college-mates at that time would spend most of \ntheir free time intensely preparing for the exams. Whenever he would even think about \nthe tests he would become terribly frightened; he would have been extremely happy not \nto have to sit for the tests. Everyone else would forgive him. But Gurudev?!! Oh no, there \nwas no hope of any deliverance from him on this matter; he was a “very hard nut to \ncrack”! Also, it was because of Gurudev’s instructions that Mukunda Lal had re-enrolled \nin college and, as per Gurudev’s directive from quite a while ago, he absolutely had to \nreceive a B.A. degree. But the boat was about to sink! Who could save it from drowning \nnow? What other recourse was there for Mukunda Lal other than relying on Sri Guru’s \nGrace? At that time, Gurudev was in Puri, staying for the time being in his ashram there. \nWithout any other way out, Mukunda Lal hurried off to see his guru in Puri. Upon \nhearing about his disciple’s situation regarding preparations for the exams, Gurudev \nsolemnly said, “Go back home. Work as hard as you can and get ready for the tests. Do \nnot waste even a single moment.” Mukunda Lal had thought that perhaps after hearing \nabout his predicament Gurudev would be a bit sympathetic towards him and perhaps he \nwould advise Mukunda to not sit for the exams this year and prepare for next year.

And Mukunda of course had to follow his guru’s orders. \nHe returned to Calcutta in this crestfallen state, and putting his faith fully upon Sadguru, \nimmersed himself into studying day and night for the exams. He had not even a drop of \nfaith in his own ability to pass the tests; his sole reliance was his all-beneficent savior \nGurudev. In due time, the exams were held and completed. The announcement of the \nresults showed that Mukunda Lal had passed. \n \n \nStudying for the B.A. Degree in a College in Serampore and Traveling to Kashmir \nwith Sri Guru \n \n \nThe other shore was not yet in sight; Mukunda Lal still had to finish the B.A. \ndegree. He felt that it could not go on like this any more. If he had to continue with \ncollege then he had to enroll in some college close to Gurudev’s residence. This running \nback and forth between Calcutta and Serampore to have only a little time in Gurudev’s \ncompany – this situation had to change. Mukunda Lal proposed to Gurudev that if he had \nto study for the B.A., then he wanted to do so at a college in Serampore, and he prayed \nfor Gurudev’s permission. Hearing this proposal, Gurudev smiled within and said that he \nwould write to Mukunda’s father Bhagabati Charan and organize everything. Gurudev of \ncourse knew what his spiritual son’s real intentions were. Arrangements were then made \nfor Mukunda Lal to begin the B.A. program at the Wesleyan Mission College in \nSerampore and to stay at his previously mentioned uncle Sarada Charan’s home. Sarada \nCharan’s house was on Rani Road (presently Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road), only \ntwo or three minutes from Gurudev’s house. Sarada Charan set up separate quarters for \nMukunda in which he could live and study in privacy. Mukunda Lal was extremely \nhappy; now it was very easy to be in Gurudev’s company daily. However, within a short \ntime, he came to know that his father and aunt back home were being informed of his \nactivities, and that his father was finding out that Mukunda was spending most of his time \nwith his guru instead of studying! In order to keep an eye on him, the pragmatically \nexperienced Bhagabati Charan took measures to have Mukunda’s younger brother \nSananda Lal to also stay and study with him. Mukunda Lal began to think of a way out of \nthis distressing situation. And a resolution was found. It was arranged for Mukunda to \nstay in the college hostel itself. Now there was no hindrance in going to see Gurudev. \nAnd this happened not only during off-hours; many times he skipped class to spend time \nwith Gurudev, if not every day, then certainly very regularly. Mukunda Lal was now like \na free bird. However, Sananda Lal tried to keep track of his elder brother’s whereabouts, \nand he reported whatever he found out to his father. But there was nothing more that \ncould be done about his spiritually-mad son; Bhagabati Charan had to resign to be \ncontent with Mukunda Lal studying for the B.A. at all. The result of staying at the hostel \nwas this: not only were classes skipped from time to time, but Mukunda Lal would not \neven come back to the hostel some nights, spending the time instead with Gurudev. It was \nat this time that Mukunda Lal experienced the touch of the outwardly stern \nSriyukteshvarji’s tender heart within. Among the many disciples of Sriyukteshvarji, only \nMukunda Lal had the fortune of experiencing this very secret and unknown side of \nGurudev’s nature. When Yoganandaji returned to India in 1935, he spoke of two such \nincidents; it is possible that these accounts came out of his mouth when he was not being \n31 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Once Swamiji Maharaj Sriyukteshvarji fell very ill; \nthere was tremendous pain in his head. Mukunda Lal was tending to his Gurudev. At \nsome point he held Sriyukteshvarji’s head on his lap and was stroking his Gurudev’s \nforehead in order to relieve the pain. At this time, Swamiji Maharaj spoke out, “If I ever \nfall, will you be able to take me up in your lap like this?!” When the world-renowned \nYoganandaji was recounting this event, his eyes welled up with tears. And it seems there \nwas another time when Gurudev said to him, “After you came, any desire I may have had \nto marry again completely disappeared.” When recounting this expression of Gurudev’s \nlove towards him, Yoganandaji had his head bowed and was lost in the absorption of love \nfor his Gurudev. The writer has heard from Swami Satyanandaji: it seems that Mukunda \nLal used to whisper in the ears of his dearest friends and followers Basu Kumar and \nManomohan, “The Beloved is the Supreme Guru.” It is very possible that he used to state \nthis maxim of conduct to them after experiencing Gurudev’s expression of Divine Love. \nTo see this kind of depth and beauty in a guru-disciple relationship is unquestionably very \nrare.  \n \n \nDuring one of the summer holidays at this time in Serampore, Mukunda Lal made \nplans to visit Kashmir with some of his friends and Gurudev. Gurudev agreed to go. \nEntreating his father, Mukunda Lal was able to procure the money needed to fund the \ncost of the trip and gather the required necessities such as railway passes etc.  The date \nfor travel was then set. On that date and time, all of his friends assembled at the train \nstation; it was planned previously that Mukunda Lal would bring Swamiji Maharaj to the \nstation. A short while before leaving the house, Swamiji Maharaj said that they should \nleave just a little later. A few moments after that Mukunda Lal was suddenly struck with a \ncombination of diarrhea and vomiting, and he fell terribly ill. Gurudev hurriedly began to \ntend to him. His friends waited at the station and when they did not see Swamiji Maharaj \nor Mukunda after a long period, they went to Swamiji Maharaj’s house. They were \nstunned to see their dear friend’s condition. A physician was called, and after being \ntenderly taken care of by his Gurudev and friends, Mukunda Lal recovered his health, \nmuch to the relief of everyone. Yoganandaji used to say that Gurudev knew beforehand \nthat he would be stricken like that at that time and that is why Swamiji Maharaj said that \nthey should leave a little later. After Mukunda Lal’s recovery, Swamiji Maharaj himself \nset the new date for traveling to Kashmir, and soon enough, everyone again became \nexcited about going to the land that was known as “bhusvarga” [heaven on earth]. The \ntrain journey took them through stops at Simla and Rawalpindi. Everyone was captivated \nby Simla’s beautiful scenery. From Rawalpindi the travelers took horse-drawn carriages \nto Srinagar, the capital city of Kashmir. No one could hold back their joy upon seeing the \nloveliness of this “heaven on earth.” After spending a few days and seeing all the major \nsights, they also experienced the attraction for which Kashmir is well known – residing in \none of the famous houseboats in Srinagar. Finally, Mukunda Lal and his friends had to \nleave for home. Swamiji Maharaj would stay in Kashmir for a few more days with two \nassistants at his side. When they were saying their goodbyes, Gurudev told Mukunda Lal \nthat most likely a dangerous illness would befall him [Sriyukteshvarji] very soon; it could \neven take his life. Mukunda Lal was absolutely beside himself upon hearing this. He \ncried out to Gurudev that there for no reason whatsoever could he cast off his body now, \nand that he had to promise this before Mukunda and his friends would leave for home. \n32 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

But within just a few days, news arrived saying that Gurudev \nwas extremely ill in Kashmir. In desperation, Mukunda Lal said to his father that he \nimmediately needed to write a telegram to his Gurudev. In the wire, Mukunda \nbeseechingly reminded Gurudev of his promise, and begged him to not even think about \nleaving his body in any way whatsoever. Swamiji Maharaj recovered a few days later and \nreturned home from Kashmir. \n \n \nReceiving the B.A. Degree \n \n \nThe beginning of the year 1914 came and the B.A. examinations were also at \nhand. One day, Gurudev asked how the preparations for the tests were going. Mukunda \nLal dried up inside upon hearing this question. How could he possibly tell Gurudev the \ntruth? Somehow he answered, “Preparations are happening.” But far from preparation \neven being mentioned, just thinking that he would have to sit for the exams made \nMukunda Lal completely discombobulated. Gurudev asked the same question another \nday and although not sounding completely sheepish and helpless, Mukunda was not very \nconvincing in his answer. When Gurudev asked a third time on another day, Mukunda \nsaid with trepidation, “I’m thinking that maybe I won’t sit for the tests this year. I’ll \nprepare well for the exams next year and take them then.” Upon hearing this answer, \nSwamiji Maharaj stared directly at Mukunda and gravely said, “You have to take the \nexams this year and you also have to pass. I won’t hear another word. Now go. Study and \nprepare.” There was no possible way Mukunda Lal could say anything in response to this, \nand neither did he have the courage to do so. With his head lowered like a sacrificial \nanimal, he returned to the college hostel. But before he left, Gurudev named a certain \nclassmate and told Mukunda to discuss and get advice on the subjects from this student \nand to study with him as well. Swamiji Maharaj had actually heard about this excellent \nstudent previously from Mukunda Lal himself. After returning to the students’ quarters, \nMukunda met that classmate friend, revealed his sorry predicament, and asked him for \nhis help in studying. The friend enthusiastically agreed and said that he would help in \nevery way he could. Steadying himself, Mukunda Lal began to study for the exams. His \nfriend tried to help as much as possible. But the more he studied, the more discouraged \nMukunda Lal became. It became obvious that however far he felt that he had fallen \nbehind, he was actually much, much farther behind than where he thought he was. It was \nnothing but misguided bravado to even imagine sitting for the exams in this state. But \nhow could he explain this to his leonine Gurudev? Thinking about that regal, fiery form \nmade Mukunda cringe with apprehension. He resigned himself to whatever fate had \nwritten; he had to take the tests; there was no way out. He immersed himself day and \nnight in study, but there was not even a glint of light showing any sort of progress. The \nexamination days had almost arrived. One day right at this time, Mukunda was walking \non the road with books in hand when a piece of paper – a page from a notebook – floated \npast him. It was bouncing and rolling – moving away slowly on the road ahead. He \nquickly went and grabbed the paper and saw that on it were some test questions from one \n33 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Saying “whatever fate may hold,” he \ndecided that he would just prepare for those questions alone. Those questions happened \nto be for the subject in which he was the most behind and which he feared the most. He \nreturned to the students’ quarters and carefully began to prepare for all of the questions on \nthat paper. Finally, the first day of the exams arrived. Taking blessings and the dust off of \nthe feet of Sri Guru on his head, Mukunda Lal sat for the exams, relying on nothing but \nSri Guru. But he was amazed and overjoyed to find out that most of the questions for his \nmost feared subject happened to be printed versions of the questions on the questionnaire \nhe had found lying around on the road. Happily, he wrote down what he had studied. He \ntried his best on the other days with the other tests as well. But Mukunda Lal felt that \nthere was no hope of succeeding without his Gurudev’s Grace. The results were \neventually announced. When he saw that his name was printed among those who had \npassed, he could not find any reason for this being possible other than his Gurudev’s \ndivine powers and his infinite Grace towards his disciple. Mukunda Lal had fulfilled his \nspiritual teacher’s wish and was now the recipient of a B.A. degree! Dancing with joy, he \nwent first to his Gurudev, prostrated to him and presented him with this wonderful news. \nAnd no matter whom Mukunda Lal met to tell them of this joyous happening, right at the \nvery beginning he would say that this achievement had absolutely nothing to do with his \nown abilities; it was possible only by the might of his supremely compassionate Guru’s \nimmeasurable yogic powers.

But he stopped going to the \nuniversity after just a few days. It was at this time that his future life of service would be \nset in motion. It can be said this was the beginning of becoming the “engine of the \nfuture,” as was prophesied by the Supreme Yogi and Holy of Holies, Paramguru Lahiri \nBaba. The two follower-friends Basu Kumar and Manomohan were overjoyed to now \nhave their leader in Calcutta all the time. Manomohan had passed his matriculation exams \nand had just enrolled in college, and Basu Kumar was enrolled for M.A. studies. The \nthree of them again began to do sadhana together, along with performing devotionals and \nhaving spiritual discussions. And now, a desire to have an “ashram” of their own arose in \nMukunda. But from where would the funds come? His father was taking care of his \nregular needs. Mukunda could not possibly ask him to fund this kind of whim on top of \nthe support he was already providing. The prayer room at Tulsi Narayan’s house was not \nthat appropriate, and it was not private or quiet enough. After a long search, a place was \nfound in a shantytown of Muraripukur by the canal in north Calcutta. It was nothing but a \nshack in a shantytown, but still it was their own! It was in this new “ashram” that the \nthree friends practiced Kriya Yoga, meditation and devotionals together, and they also \nbegan to hold gatherings of spiritual discussions from time to time. Mukunda Lal and his \ntwo follower-friends were extremely happy at having founded this first “ashram.” No one \n– not even Mukunda Lal himself – could imagine at that time that this totally \nunremarkable and seemingly insignificant “ashram” would grow into an immense world-\nwide institution as the primary example of Mukunda Lal’s – later Yoganandaji’s – \nachievements, and would evolve into a shining beacon of the ancient spiritual wisdom of \nIndia. \n \n \nRefusal of the Allure of a Lucrative Job \n \n \nHowever, Mukunda’s extremely wise and life-seasoned father Bhagabati Charan \ndid not remain a silent witness. This highly able, vigilant man with great insight in human \nnature was well aware of his son’s tendencies since birth and was trying to find some way \nto make Mukunda Lal into a householder. Being the tremendously adept and powerful \npersonal secretary of the Agent of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway Company, this great \nachiever secretly received permission from the Agent to create a high and very well-paid \nposition within the rail company for his B.A. graduate son. Along with the railway, this \ncompany also earned tens of millions of rupees from the manufacturing and sale of \nequipment for businesses. The main yard of the company was in Kharagpur, which is also \nwhere the deals and shipments were made for the aforementioned equipment. But there \nwas only one managing director of operations for all the work in this area, a controller \n35 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 37, "text": " \nwho carried out his duties from the company’s central offices in Calcutta. Stating that \nthere was a need for more organization in this massively important division of the firm, \nBhagabati Charan convinced the Agent to create a position of Deputy Controller for the \nKharagpur affairs. The monthly salary for this position was six hundred rupees. How \nattractive a salary this was for that time can only be understood in comparison to salaries \nin other high level positions; for example, the monthly income for an I.C.S. officer of the \nGovernment of India at that time was two hundred fifty rupees. One day the astute \nBhagabati Charan struck up a conversation with his son about the goings on at the \nashram. After listening for a while he said, “Because you’re having to do this by begging, \nhaving to run this ashram by getting whatever you can from begging, I’ve found a very \nwell paid job for you. You can do whatever you like from that salary; make and run an \nashram, or spend that money on whatever you like. I don’t need any money; so you don’t \nhave to worry about giving even a cent of that salary to me.” Mukunda Lal’s clever father \nhad the contract papers for his son with him, already signed by the Agent, which he now \nput in Mukunda Lal’s hands. Mukunda was astounded at the seeing the amount of the \nmonthly salary written in the contract. How much effort they had to make to just make \nends meet at their poor ashram! Although he found the idea of working at a job for \nsomeone else an absolutely repulsive thing, he could not reject his father’s proposition \noutright, especially on account of the salary. He said that he needed to think about it for a \nfew days. He returned hastily to the ashram in Muraripukur and the three friends began to \ndeeply analyze the proposition. Seeing that the salary was beyond anything that any of \nthem could have thought up, all three were at a loss for what to do. It would make things \nso much easier if this kind of money came in every month. But alas, it had to end up like \nthis! Taking a job after all?! All three were united at heart; they were true friends; they \nwere tied together by a vow that they would formally take sannyas; they were only \nyouths, not mature about the world; it was indeed a difficult decision for them to make. \nBut the main character in this particular situation was Mukunda Lal; thus he was the one \nwho had to make the decision. The three friends stayed up all night discussing the matter. \nFinally, Mukunda came to a resolution and made his decision. He said that no matter how \nattractive the money is, if one steps in that trap once, there is no way of escaping it. But it \nwould not be right to just throw away this much money. “The snake must be killed, but \nwithout breaking the stick.” If some kind of way could be found to achieve this, it would \nbe the ideal thing. And such a way was found. Mukunda Lal’s cousin, Serampore’s Uncle \nSarada’s son Prabhas Chandra was a diligent B.A. graduate, sweet in behavior, physically \nvery attractive and very sharp in intellect. And he was also a true follower-devotee of \nelder cousin-brother Mukunda Lal. Although in the B.A. exams he placed second with \nhonors in philosophy, it was in the second class. Prabhas Chandra’s classmate friend \nSaroj Das – who would later become the head of the philosophy department of a \nuniversity and a venerated professor as well – placed first in first class. Feeling angry and \ndejected at not being placed in first class, Prabhas Chandra decided to not pursue the \nM.A. And Mukunda Lal decided that he would tell his father to give that job to Prabhas \nChandra, with the condition that Mukunda’s cousin would freely donate funds from his \nsalary to help the ashram. This decision was satisfactory to all three friends. Mukunda \ntook this proposition to his father and said that Prabhas Chandra was far more qualified \nfor this type of work, and besides that, he did not at all want to take up a regular job \nhimself. Mukunda Lal requested his father to please consider this option. Bhagabati \n36 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 38, "text": " \nCharan knew his son’s nature and mentality very well, and on the outside at least, he said \nwith anger and disappointment, “All right then. Just go and do whatever you want.” He \nhad had to flatter and indulge his Agent boss quite a lot to be able to create this position \nin the name of his son. But now his son was completely against taking this job; how \ncould he face the Agent now? And he also had to acknowledge that Mukunda Lal’s \nstatement was correct: Prabhas Chandra actually was a much better candidate for the \nposition than Mukunda – in every way. Besides that, after creating a job with this kind of \nsalary and prestige, it would also not sit well if someone outside the family got the \nposition. After mulling it over for a while, Bhagabati Charan somehow, with great effort, \nmade the Agent understand this situation and thereafter hired Prabhas Chandra for the \nposition. Getting a job with that kind of salary with a railway company at such a young \nage was unthinkable in those days. But because of Mukunda Lal’s love and compassion, \nPrabhas Chandra had just such a position, and his facial hair was not even like a full \ngrown adult’s at this time. Even in later years there was no sign of any change in the love \nthat Yoganandaji and Prabhas Chandra felt for each other. Prabhas Chandra and his \nvirtuous wife were an ideal couple; however they had no children. His younger brother \nPrakash Chandra’s son and daughter were looked upon as children of both brothers. Both \nof their wives were also very close and were there for each other in every way. Elder \nstepbrother Prasad Chandra Ghosh also held a high position with a rail company – the \nE.I. Railway. Prabhas Chandra continuously gave a great deal of financial support to \nYoganandaji’s ashramic work; he even donated his paternal home in Serampore. When \nYoganandaji established his Yogoda Satsanga Society in India, he assigned the position of \n“Saha Sabhapati” [Co-Director or Co-Chairman] to Prabhas Chandra. Even before \nBhagabati Charan retired, Prabhas Chandra proved himself as an indispensable and \nhighly respected member of the company. And this was not at all an easy achievement at \nthat time, because in those days, all of the rail companies’ highest positions were taken by \nBritish personnel, and there was a monopoly held on the jobs just under them by the \n“anglo-Indian” collective. \n \n \nTaking the Vow of Sannyas \n \n \nIn any case, after all of this, Mukunda Lal made up his mind that he was not going \nto wait any longer; it was time to take the formal vow of sannyas [renunciation/renunciate \nmonkhood]. When he expressed this desire to Gurudev, Sriyukteshvarji happily agreed. \nMukunda Lal now presented himself by his sannyas name – Swami Yogananda. \nImmediately after having become a sannyasi, a desire to make new efforts at service \ndawned in him. Of course, first and foremost, he would put his whole being into the work \nof his guru’s Yogoda Satsanga Sabha. Up to now, the main center for the Calcutta-based \npart of this organization was in Kidderpore [Khidirpur], a branch which had some highly \nadvanced disciples of Sriyukteshvarji in attendance, such as Amulya Charan Santra, \nAmulya Das, Charu Chandra Mitra and writer Roy Bahadur Atul Chandra Choudhury. \nNow, Swami Yogananda set up another center in Calcutta, comprised mostly of educated \nyouths who were disciple-devotees. The elder Kriyavans in Kidderpore were delighted at \nthe efforts of this energetic, young yogi guru-brother. The Kidderpore Kriyavans were \nwell aware of Yogananda’s father Bhagabati Charan’s renowned status, because the B.N. \n37 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Among the guru-brothers [in this \ncase, the disciples of Sriyukteshvarji] Moti Babu was considered most senior and in \n1902, it was to him that Sriyukteshvarji bestowed the title of “sampadak” [executive or \ndirector] of Swamiji Maharaj’s newly created Satsanga Sabha.

Yogananda \nalso wanted to follow in Vivekananda’s footsteps in a similar way. He set it in his mind to \ngo to Japan to spread the wisdom and teachings of yoga. In those days, Japan was sort of \na place of pilgrimage for independence-hungry Indians.

The astounding battle at Port Arthur had become \na sort of symbol. All Indian youths knew that Swami Vivekananda had said that the city \nof Yokohama was like a paradise on earth. For all such young Indians, traveling and \nseeing Japan was the same as going on a great pilgrimage. Yogananda decided that he \nwould go and see this dreamland of a nation. The year was 1916; he was twenty-three \nyears old. Yogananda boarded an eastbound ship, crossed the Sea of China to the Pacific \nOcean and eventually arrived in the city of Kobe. He was highly impressed by the \ncleanliness and orderliness of the city. However, he became absolutely disillusioned by \nthe societal behavior of the people. He had believed the type of cultural and societal \nbehavior by which he was brought up since birth to be the foundation of his life, and the \nnorms and mores of this land seemed to be in conflict with his ideals. Yogananda was \nmentally distressed. He thus concluded that it was actually better to leave this \ninappropriate atmosphere. After just a few days of being in Japan, he returned on an \nIndia-bound ocean-liner. There were two significant events related to the Japan journey – \nthe creation of a manuscript by Yoganandaji while on the ship and the establishment of \nclose friendships with a couple of the passengers on board. The manuscript was later \npublished in the United States as “Science of Religion,” and this was the very first book \nhe composed. Among the passengers on board, one was Dr. Satyendra Nath Mitra, who \nbecame very drawn to Kriya Yoga after conversing with Yoganandaji, and upon his return \nto India, Dr. Mitra received Kriya Yoga initiation from Swamiji Maharaj Sriyukteshvar \nGiri. The second significant passenger was Captain Rashid from an eminent family in the \nIndian city of Bombay. He had Western blood in him from both sides of his family. Very \nspiritual-minded, intelligent and open-hearted, this young man received Kriya Yoga \ninitiation from Yoganandaji himself. Although he was Muslim by birth and family, his \nperspective was very open and he carried a lively and uplifted attitude in work and \ndealings with others. He had traveled to Europe, America and other countries since he \nwas very young and he moved in the most exclusive and highest circles of society in \nevery place. When Yoganandaji was facing many sorts of difficulties in America, an \nunexpected meeting occurred in the United States between him and Captain Rashid, and \nCaptain Rashid took up the responsibility for setting up an organization there. Helping \nSwamiji substantially and in many ways, Captain Rashid was invaluable to Swamiji \nbeing established successfully in America. \n \n \nFounding the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya \n \n \nAfter returning to India from Japan, back together with friend-followers Basu \nKumar and Manomohan, Yogananda again dived fully into his previous work with the \nYogoda Satsanga Sabha. A short while afterwards, upon reading and hearing about the \nworld-renowned Nobel-laureate Rabindranath Tagore’s Shantiniketan Ashram, where \nmodern academic education was being disseminated in an ideal and natural atmosphere \nlike the days of yore, a desire arose in him to establish an ashram-school similar to that. \nHe also came to know from Gurudev about the ideal kind of “guru-kula” [guru-disciple \nlineage] based “brahmacharya vidyalaya”* that needed to be established at this time and \nreceived Gurudev’s advice on its philosophy and mode of operation.

This very intelligent \nand devotion-oriented youth, named Sujodhan Das was the one with whom the imagined \n“brahmacharya vidyalaya” was begun. It was this boy who would later be known to all \nthe students at the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya as “Sujodhan-da” [elder brother Sujodhan].  \n \n[*Translator’s note: “Brahmacharya vidyalaya” in the generic sense means: an \nacademically oriented school/college with an emphasis on studying while observing \ncertain codes of living – including chastity, spiritual reverence, morality, social service \netc. – during the time of studentship. Later, Yoganandaji’s school would use \n“Brahmacharya Vidyalaya” as its official and registered name.] \n \n[**Translator’s note: “Oriya” – person from the province of Orissa.] \n \n \nThe Maharaja of Kashim Bazar was renowned for his generous support of \ncharitable work throughout India. This great man had once hidden Lord Clive in his \nhouse and saved the nobleman from being attacked and killed by mutinous soldiers. \nManindra Chandra Nandi inherited his wealth and historically famous business empire \nfrom his maternal aunt, the Maharani [queen] Swarnamayi, and was subsequently \nbestowed the title of “maharaja.” By God’s Infinite Compassion, this great man of such \nimmense wealth did not spend his finances in the superficial enjoyment of worldly \npleasures like other maharajas. His nature was such that he took it as his life’s purpose to \nuse his fortune for good works for the people of the country. It is very rare in India \nnowadays to see anyone like this freely giving and generous man. There were very few \ninstitutions or programs of higher culture – no matter what the field – which were not \ntouched by his beneficent hands or the aid of his influence and power, whether they were \nacademic and scientific institutions, or establishments related to social work and art. \nMaharaja Bahadur [Maharaja of Kashim Bazar] was Vaishnav [worshipper of Vishnu], \nand his generosity in the area of the religious and spiritual affairs of the Hindus was \nknown to all. One day, it dawned on Yogananda that he would like to see the Maharaja \nand ask him for his partnership and help in establishing the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya. \nThus, on an auspicious date, he went to the Maharaja’s residence in Calcutta and was able \nto have an audience with him. After introductions, when the Maharaja heard Yogananda’s \nproposition, he looked silently at Yoganandaji for a short while and said, “You are God-\nsent.* During the last few days, I had also been thinking about establishing just such an \nashram-school.” It was as if they both were cut from the same mold as visionaries – a \nperfect fit of gem and gold. Yogananda let the Maharaja know that he had already begun \na very small version of the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya with his friend-followers in \nCalcutta. Very happy at hearing this, the Maharaja asked Swamiji to prepare and present \nto him a document outlining the mission, description and plan of operations for the \nashram school as soon as possible. \n40 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

The three friends were ecstatic. Now, \nfirst and foremost was the preparation of a detailed description of the goals and methods \nof the school and arranging for the Maharaja to have a look at the efforts – albeit \nminiscule in scale – they had made already. The responsibility of writing the description \nwas put on Basu Kumar because he was considered to be the best in the area of academic \nstudies – most probably passed the M.A. by this time – and was the clearest thinker. \nYogananda organized a gathering to welcome the Maharaja to see what they had begun as \nan example of the brahmacharya vidyalaya to come. The detailed proposal was finished \nand Basu Kumar delivered it to the Maharaja by his own hand. Upon reading the outlined \nplans, Maharaja Bahadur became extremely interested and said that he would like to see \nthe ashram-school that had already been begun, small or not. Yogananda was preparing of \ncourse for just such an event, but one uncomfortable thing was that the total studentship \nof their school amounted to only one – Sujodhan. Some others had to be called in to \nrepresent themselves as brahmachari-students, at least for that day in front of the \nMaharaja. Among them was Yogananda’s youngest brother Bishnu Charan and \nManomohan’s third brother Khireshmohan. Giving them some quick training in reciting \nsacred Sanskrit verses and clothing each of them in yellow garments, these youths were \ndressed up as little “brahmacharis” [chaste monks]. In the welcome committee were of \ncourse Tulsi Narayan and other such regular attendees; Acharya Ashutosh Shastri \nMahasaya was one among the elders present. With the clarion call of conch shells, \nMaharaja Bahadur was welcomed and ushered in. The gathering took place in the one-\nfloor cottage adjacent to Tulsi Narayan’s family home. After the children recited sacred \nSanskrit verses with palms in prayerful gesture, there was devotional singing and \nchanting. The virtue-minded Maharaja was enchanted by seeing the brahmachari-garbed \nyouths, and was very pleased at hearing the recitation of sacred verses and devotional \nsinging. He enthusiastically promised to take up the financial responsibility for the \nestablishing and daily running of a brahmacharya vidyalaya. Seeing this extraordinary \nand unimaginable way by which his vision became fulfilled, Yogananda became \novercome with joy, as he acknowledged the unseen hand of God and the Masters of his \nlineage behind it all. \n \n \nFirst Establishment of School in Dihika – Relocating Later to Ranchi \n \n \nIn the district of Burdwan [Bardhoman], on the banks of the Damodar river, in \nlovely and serene setting in a village named Dihika, there was a landowner’s office-house \nbelonging to the princely estate of the Maharaja of Kashim Bazar. Maharaja Bahadur had \nthe edifice repainted, cleaned up the land on which it was situated and added other \nrooms/cottages as was necessary, and handed over the entire property to Yoganandaji for \nthe establishment of the brahmacharya vidyalaya.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 43, "text": " \non the 22nd of March in 1917 of the Christian year, 12th of Chaitra in the Bengali calendar \n– on the Great Spring Equinox, the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya was founded on this very \nproperty. The official patron was of course the previously mentioned Maharaja of Kashim \nBazar, Manindra Chandra Nandi Bahadur. Many personages of noble repute were in \nattendance on that day of founding. Many people also came from Asansol. The heads of \nschool naturally were Yogananda, Basu Kumar and Manomohan. To give them and show \nhis enthusiastic support, Acharya Ashutosh Shastri Mahasaya was also present. \nManomohan still had not finished his college studies at that time. Thus, the faculty of the \nschool was comprised of Yogananda as principal/director, Basu Kumar as headmaster and \na local colleague as another teacher. Shastri Mahasaya resided in the ashram as spiritual \nteacher, teaching the students on the virtuous aspects of living. It was in this very place – \nmeaning the ashram-school in Dihika – where Yogananda initiated Basu Kumar into the \npath of sannyas and gave him his new name – Swami Dhirananda. The Brahmacharya \nVidyalaya began with only six students in residence. However, this number quietly began \nto grow. At that time, there were only two ashram-schools of this type in Bengal – one \nwas the Shantiniketan Vidyalaya and the other was this Brahmacharya Vidyalaya in \nDihika. Shantiniketan was influenced by the openness of Rabindranath Tagore, leaning \nsomewhat towards the philosophy of the Brahmo Samaj,* and most of its students were \nfrom wealthy families. The Dihika Brahmacharya Vidyalaya was founded upon the \nHindu “guru-kula” ideals, and was very attractive to conservative and middle class \nparents. Thus, the good reputation of this ashram-school began to spread all over, and \nalong with that the number of enrollees also began to increase greatly, and problems with \nthe allotment of space for the school began to be seen. At this time, Maharaja Manindra \nChandra himself came to visit the school, and was very satisfied upon seeing the program \nat work. Swamiji Maharaj Sriyukteshvarji also came to see the ashram once. When \nYogananda heard that Sriyukteshvarji was approaching the school, he became so \novercome with joy that he darted out bare-chested and barefooted, and he more or less \nran for quite a distance until he reached Sriyukteshvarji, welcomed him and escorted him \nto the ashram himself. This was a very special opportunity for Yoganandaji to show his \nfirst creation and the first big accomplishment in his life to the one who was his teacher \nof teachers. \n \n[*Translator’s note: The “Brahmo Samaj” was a non-deistic sect in Bengal whose \nphilosophy emphasized the aspect of the Divine beyond all attributes.] \n \n \nAs the good name of the school spread, highly educated and qualified young \nteachers began to express interest in joining the institution. Among the first to join was \nSri Shashi Bhushan Ghosh from the town of Bankura; he was an M.A. degree holder and \na mantra-initiated disciple of Mother Sri Sri Sarada Moni Devi.* Although not a Kriya \nYoga practitioner like Yogananda and his follower-friends, Shashi Babu was wholly \nrevered and loved by all of them. It seems that Yoganandaji had said, “So what if Shashi \nBabu isn’t a Kriyavan. When we see him close his eyes and sit for meditation, can \nanyone say that he is less than us in any way?” Meanwhile, the number of students \nincreased daily and the lack of space became a serious problem. It was concluded that the \nschool had to be relocated. After much deliberation, Maharaja Bahadur himself found a \nsolution by opening up an enormous mansion on one of the properties of Kashim Bazar. \n42 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 44, "text": " \nAlthough the lack of space was solved, another more horrific problem confronted the \nashram-residents. At that time, these parts of Bengal were beset with a malaria epidemic. \nBoth students and teachers of the ashram became bedridden with the disease. Maharaja \nBahadur was extremely distressed. As it was usual practice to change patients’ location \nand climate to improve health in those days, the entire school was moved again to another \nof the Maharaja’s palaces, this time to a place called Madhopur, somewhat far from \nKashim Bazar. And though this place was comparatively better, the ashram-residents \ncould not still fully recover from the illness. The exasperated Maharaja then took \neveryone to his resort house called “Jamai Bari,” and while there, the Maharaja himself, \nalong with his very able attendants, nursed and brought everyone back to health. And for \na while the austere ashram-residents enjoyed a bit of princely leisure as well. At this time, \nAnanda Mohan Lahiri – the grandson of Yogiraj Sri Sri Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya \n– joined the faculty of the school. In any case, this respite did not last for very long; signs \nof malaria began to show in some students again. To end this once and for all, Maharaja \nBahadur sent everyone to his immense palace in Ranchi, situated on a seventy-five bigha \n[approx. 25 acres] sprawling estate in idyllic surroundings. The ashram and everyone in it \nwere moved to Ranchi in July of 1918. After only a short while, all who were ill regained \ntheir health at the lovely Ranchi summer home of Maharaja Bahadur – who also was the \nGovernor of Bihar and Orissa.** No one wanted to leave Ranchi now, although it was \nonly supposed to be a healing retreat. The compassionate and virtuous Maharaja fulfilled \neveryone’s inner wish and designated the Ranchi estate to be the new place where the \nschool would be established. From then on the school became known as the “Ranchi \nBrahmacharya Vidyalaya” as its official name. \n \n[*Translator’s note: Sri Sri Sarada Moni Devi was the venerated wife of Sri Sri \nRamakrishna Paramhansa.] \n \n[*Translator’s note: Ranchi is in the province of Bihar.] \n \n \nOn the same year that the school was permanently established in Ranchi, the one \nwho followed Yoganandaji like his shadow – Manomohan – became a B.A. degree \ngraduate. Immediately after that, he was initiated by Yoganandaji into the path of \nsannyas, and was hereafter known as Swami Satyananda Giri. He then completely \ndedicated himself to the work of the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya. At this time, two teachers \nof high standard joined the faculty. One was Bijoy Krishna Dutta of Burdwan, who held \nan M.Sc. degree and was also a student of Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose, and the other \nwas Pandit Ramendra Nath Bhattacharya from Bishnupur of the Bankura district. Bijoy \nKrishna was married; Ramendra Nath was unmarried and celibate. The three swamijis \nwere the heads of the school. Yogananda was head swamiji, Basu Kumar was middle \nswamiji, and Satyanandaji was young swamiji. It could be said that the entire faculty was \nbasically comprised of young people, whether supervisors or teachers. Yogananda was \nonly twenty-five years of age; the teachers were also of similar age, and everyone called \neach other with the adjunct “dada.”* Excepting the three swamijis, the students also \ncalled their teachers with the “dada” adjunct, such as: “Shashi-da, Ananda-da, Bijoy-da” \netc. Of course the Pandit Mahasaya [Ramendra Nath] was not addressed as “Ramen-da”; \nhe was simply called “Pandit Mahasaya.” Other than Ananda-da, the teachers were not \n43 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Acharya Shastri \nMahasaya lived in the ashram itself; he was in charge of spiritual and philosophical \neducation, teaching the Gita and other spiritual and philosophical works. He also initiated \ncertain older students into the path of Kriya Yoga, if they were serious in their interest \nand fit for the practice. From time to time, Gurudev Sriyukteshvarji would come to the \nashram for three or four days at a time. During those days, with Yogananda leading the \nway, the ashram would be filled with a festive atmosphere. It was more or less certain \nthat Sriyukteshvarji would always be present on the anniversaries of the founding of the \nschool. \n \n[*Translator’s note: As has been stated previously, the Bengali adjunct “dada” (or “da” in \nthe short form) literally means “elder brother.” However, this is used in addressing boys \nor men who are not from one’s family, as an informal suffix of respect for those who are \neither similar in age or older (never to those who are significantly younger).] \n \n \nIt has already been mentioned that, in those days, there were only two ashram-\nbased schools in the province of Bengal. Shantiniketan – both in patronage and ideals – \nwas open-minded and operated in modern ways; the Ranchi Brahmacharya Vidyalaya \ntook the ancient “guru-kula” ideals and blended them with modern methods of teaching, \ncreating a new educational system by which they were engaged in trying to create \nsocietal reform. The students at the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya had to wear garments \ncolored with a natural yellow dye; hair was kept long; as a bedspread or as body-covering \nfor cold, only a wool blanket was allowed; and the use of mattresses or comforters was \nforbidden. The diet was lacto-vegetarian. To prevent the students’ hair from becoming \nmatted, they were required to apply mustard-oil once a week – on the hair and also on the \nbody. But usually the students could not take care of their hair, particularly the young \nones, and because of this many of them also had to suffer from lice in the scalp. About \nthis, a funny statement made at that time by an eminent Bengali lady comes to mind. This \ncultured lady was very interested in enrolling her son in a residential school of excellence \nand she had been gathering information about Shantiniketan and the Brahmacharya \nVidyalaya. Confused about where to enroll her son, she described both schools to her \ngirlfriend and said, “If I enroll him in Shantiniketan, he’ll come back with some girl for a \nwife, and if I enroll him in Ranchi, he’ll come back with a head full of lice!” This \nstatement brought to surface an unsaid division that existed between the two schools’ \nenvironments. \n \n \nAmong the three swamijis, Acharya Yogananda was an open-hearted vessel of \nlove; his deeply spiritual nature and innocent, childlike behavior was attractive and \nenchanting to everyone. Swami Satyananda was like Yogananda’s reflection, and even if \nhe was not the same as Yogananda, he was very dear to the students. Dhirananda was \nsomber, discipline-oriented and a stern enforcer of rules. Sometime later, Swami \nSatyananda was posted as the head of the brahmacharya vidyalaya in Swami \nSriyukteshvar Giri Maharaj’s ashram in Puri, and he had to leave the Ranchi school. The \nscene that was made when he was saying his goodbyes was such that Sriyukteshvarji later \njokingly remarked to Satyanandaji, “By the way they kicked you out – it looks like it’ll \nbe quite a problem for you to go back to Ranchi!!” But Satyanandaji did not stay in Puri \n44 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Satyanandaji later said, “The time I spent with \nmy Gurudev in Puri in those days was the greatest time in my life of sadhana.” \n \n \nJourney to America \n \n \nThe year 1920 was the year of greatest transformative importance in Yogananda’s \nlife, where the events themselves transpired in somewhat supernatural ways. One Sunday \n– the off day at the ashram-school – Yoganandaji was lying on his bed, resting in his \nquarters after the midday meal. The afternoon moved into its later stages. The students \nwere busy playing sports and such outside. Yoganandaji got up and went to the storage \nroom of the ashram, where Bijoy-da – in charge of supervising the meals at the ashram – \nand the two cooks were organizing and gathering the foodstuffs necessary to prepare the \nevening meal. Standing in the doorway of the storage room, Yogananda asked Bijoy-da \nabout what was being prepared for the evening meal. But before Bijoy-da could answer, \nSwamiji became transfixed, looking outside the opposite window, and seconds after that \nhe said excitedly, “Bijoy-da, I’m going to America. I saw just now that I am lecturing in \nfront of hundreds and hundreds of white men and women.” And immediately after saying \nthis, he quickly headed back to his room. Bijoy-da and the cooks were shocked and \nstupefied at Swamiji’s exclamation. The Ranchi train station was fairly close to the \nashram and the train to Calcutta left a little before dusk. Bijoy-da saw that Yogananda \nwas packing to leave for Calcutta. Within a short time, the students at play found out that \ntheir beloved “head swamiji” was leaving for Calcutta in order to go to America. Students \nand teachers crowded at Swamiji’s door; they watched him with pained hearts as he \nprepared for the journey to Calcutta. As Yoganandaji walked to the station with Swami \nDhiranandaji, all of the ashram’s residents – basically leaving the ashram empty – \nfollowed him, overcome with sorrow. Saying farewell to the one so dear to all the \nstudents was unbearably painful for them. Many began to cry helplessly. The teachers \nwere also full of tears, stunned and dumfounded upon hearing from Bijoy-da about what \ncaused this sudden departure to take place out of the blue. \n \n \nAfter arriving in Calcutta, Yoganandaji immediately went to his father, touched \nhis feet and presented him with this news that he is going to America. Bhagabati Charan \nknew his spiritually mad and spontaneous son all too well. Once his son set his mind on \ngoing to America, Bhagabati Charan was well aware that that decision was impossible to \nchange. So he asked, “Where will you get the money?” His sannyasi son responded with \nperfect certainty, “God will provide it.” Yogananda’s father became silent. Completely \nswept away with the dream of going to America, Yogananda was all-consumed with \nfinding a way to make it happen. After talking to his old classmates, professors, friends \nand well-wishers, he found out that there was an international conference of religions \nbeing held in the American city of Boston that very year, with representatives from all of \nthe religions of the world. And very quickly, papers to be present at that conference as a \nrepresentative for India were arranged and procured. What was left now was the financial \nmeans for travel. Yoganandaji just could not find it anywhere. During one of these days \nhis father asked, “So! Did your god get any money for you?” Although hurt by this \nquestion, Bhagabati Charan’s son replied with the answer he had given before, albeit a bit \n45 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 47, "text": " \nmore soberly than before, “God will surely provide it.” The father answered, “Let’s see \nwhich god gets you money!” Bewildered, Yogananda just kept going everywhere round \nand round, as if he forgot about everything else. Since the time of the vision at the storage \nroom of the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, it seemed that he became oblivious to all but what \nthe vision foretold. It was so much so that he even forgot to see the most revered and \ndearest one in his life – his beloved guru Sriyukteshvarji – who had actually prepared him \nfrom behind the scenes, step by step, for this very journey. But the ever-compassionate \nguru kept abreast of every movement of his dear disciple. In any case, the money for \ntravel was nowhere to be found. Yoganandaji’s father asked for the final time, “So! Did \nyour god get you the money?” Yogananda’s mental state was desperate at the time. Still, \nhe gathered mental strength and said, although very softly, “God will surely give.” By \nthat time, Bhagabati Charan’s hand had slipped under his pillow, from where he pulled \nout a piece of paper and handed it to his son, saying, “Here. Take it.” It was a bank check \nwritten out for a large amount. Yogananda was overcome with tears of gratitude, \nreverence and devotion as he embraced his father’s feet and said, “I know it was God \nHimself who gave me this money through your hands.” With the finances secured, the \npreparatory matters for the journey to America were completed. Now all of his friends, \nrelatives and acquaintances began to look for the ship schedules and fares and such, and \nan America-bound ship that would soon be leaving from Calcutta itself was found right \naway. That ship had only one first class cabin, and it was still vacant. For the sake of time \nand convenience, that cabin was booked. All of the shopping was done as quickly as \npossible. No one came to think about the meals on the ship; there was just one person \nwho brought a tin of ghee for Swamiji, thinking that he would need it because he was \nvegetarian and this ghee could come in handy [because of the possibility of a limited \nchoice of food]. \n \n \nThere was only a little time left before the ship pulled away from the port. It had \nturned at the jetty; all of the passengers were on board; and Yogananda still had no idea \nhow big a task lay ahead of him. Suddenly he saw that his Gurudev was walking with \nsteady gait to the jetty, and upon arriving there, began walking up the steps to board the \nship. Feeling both beset with regret and thrilled with overflowing joy, as soon as Gurudev \nset his foot on board, Yogananda tearfully fell at his feet. The reason for regret: forgetting \nthe ever-compassionate one who prepared him for this path all along, and at the very time \nof the fulfillment of his loving preparation – the remorse over this was tearing apart \nYogananda’s heart. The reason for joy: even if Yogananda forgot, his infinitely \ncompassionate guru certainly did not forget to come to bless and encourage his dear \ndisciple on the day of his victorious journey! Sriyukteshvarji picked up his repentant \ndisciple and embraced him, and they both entered the cabin together. What was discussed \nwithin between guru and disciple was not possible for anyone else to know. It has been \nheard that Sriyukteshvarji had a copy of the book he had written – “The Holy Science” – \nin his hand. After the meeting of guru and disciple behind the closed doors of the cabin, \nSriyukteshvarji came out, directly alighted from the ship, and without speaking or \nlooking at anyone present there, walked away from the jetty, boarded the waiting car of \nRoy Bahadur Atul Chandra Choudhury and departed. When Gurudev was leaving the \nship, the previously mentioned book was no longer in his hand; it is possible that he gave \nit to his disciple on board. Whether before or after deciding to go to America, whether \n46 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Sriyukteshvarji was aware of every single movement \nand feeling of the ecstatically inclined and unworldly “child of humanity.” The America-\nbound ship slowly left India’s shore and began to move mid-river on the Ganges, carrying \nYoganandaji towards the ocean. Although Yoganandaji himself did not know about it, \nSriyukteshvarji knew all about the journey to America and news of all of the details of his \nmovements and doings would come to him. With the help of his disciple Atul Babu, \nSriyukteshvarji had procured the necessary papers that would allow him to board the ship \nahead of time. Roy Bahadur Atul Chandra Choudhury was a respected stevedore at the \nCalcutta port; therefore it was an easy matter to get the permission papers to board the \nship as a non-passenger. \n \n \nFellow Passengers on the Ship and First Lecture in English \n \n \nThe only Indian passenger on the ship was Swami Yogananda, and on top of that, \nhe was also the only First Class passenger. Dressed in the flowing saffron colored garb of \nHindu sannyasis, long haired and long bearded, he certainly stood out. The other \npassengers were mostly white Europeans and quite a few were English-Indians – “anglo-\nIndians.” It seemed that most of the other passengers took care to avoid Yoganandaji. He \nrealized that it must be the long hair or the long beard that the passengers did not like. \nMany of his friends and relatives had commented to him before his journey, “You’re \ngoing abroad. You should cut your hair and shave your mustache and beard.” But he did \nnot pay any attention to these statements. After all he was a sannyasi, and he would go \nlooking like a sannyasi; he was firm on this. Seeing the behavior of the passengers, he \nmay have thought that perhaps he would face the same kind of attitude in America. When \nthe ship anchored at the port of Eden, Yogananda wrote a letter to his friends that he had \nshaved his beard and mustache while docked at that port. It is possible that the fellow \npassengers on board were pleased at this, because, other than a particularly rude couple, \neveryone else began to behave normally towards him. They became especially interested \nin conversing with him upon discovering that he would be representing India at an \ninternational conference of religious representatives from around the world. However, the \npreviously mentioned couple did not hesitate to show their disdain for Yoganandaji \nwhenever their paths crossed. They were full of the racial vanity that was unfortunately \ntypical of many anglo-Indians. Yoganandaji laughed silently within and looked for a way \nto teach this racially vain couple a lesson. The most tiresome of things to endure on the \nlong liner journeys in those days was the choice of food available to the passengers. \nPractically every night they were served some sort of dish made of beans, which \neveryone grew to abhor after a while. Thinking about this predicament, Yogananda found \na way to give that couple a taste of his medicine. He spoke to the ship’s steward and \narranged to make a meal of “luchi” [Bengali deep-fried flat bread] and “aloor dom” \n[special Bengali potato curry] using that previously mentioned tin of ghee that he had \nwith him. Yoganandaji was an expert cook; this was one of his specialties. The ship’s chef \nagreed to prepare the meal according to his instructions. Meanwhile, Yoganandaji himself \ninvited all of the passengers on board to have this feast of “luchi and aloor dom” – \nexcept, very intentionally, that very special couple. As the cooking began, the passengers \n47 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

The fragrance was mouth-watering to the \ncouple as well, yet they were not invited! The woman of the couple kept walking past \nYoganandaji, back and forth, trying to get him to notice. But Swamiji behaved as if they \ndid not even exist. The closer the time of dinner approached, the more the couple became \nrestless. Finally, leaving aside her pride, the lady asked Swamiji, “The aroma of the meal \nis so wonderful. Won’t you please invite us to the dinner?” Seeing a sort of desperation in \nher eyes, Swamiji laughed within himself and said, “Of course, of course! Both of you \nare also invited. Of course you will eat with us.” Yoganandaji later said that from that day \non that couple completely shed their racial arrogance and rude attitude, and behaved \ntowards Swamiji with great openness and camaraderie for the remaining days on the ship. \nIt was during this dinner that Yoganandaji gave the first English lecture of his life. He \nwas not particularly known as a studious person in school, and he had never had the \nopportunity to lecture in English; nevertheless, he certainly did not lack in courage to \ncarry out his talk. Regarding this first lecture Swamiji had said, “When I stood up to \nspeak, everything got all confused inside my head, and for an instant I even became a bit \nfearful. I closed my eyes and remembered Gurudev. A good while passed in this silence. I \nseemed to even hear some smatterings of derision coming from the group! Suddenly I \nsaid ‘Jai Guru!’ [glory to guru] and forced myself to open my mouth. I don’t remember \nfor how long I spoke. It seemed like I was speaking effortlessly and fluently – as if it was \ncoming out automatically from within. When I finished speaking and took my seat, a roar \nof applause went up.

He was highly praised for his lecture by prominent attendees there. The most \nnoteworthy among them as far as Yoganandaji’s work was the eminent and wealthy Dr. \nLewis, who was also a citizen of Boston. It was he who began the first Yogoda Satsanga \nin Boston. He was initiated by Yoganandaji into the practice of Kriya Yoga as well. From \nthis time on, this affluent, generous and dedicated being’s love, devotion and reverence \ntowards Yoganandaji remained unbroken. Dr. Lewis was supportive of all of \nYoganandaji’s endeavors, giving enthusiasm and aiding him in his work. Yoganandaji \nworked to spread the message of yoga to Americans in many cities, but he could not quite \nget established in America. He adhered to the renunciate mentality of the sannyasis in \norder to remain detached from the American way of life. He was not able to earn enough \nto meet his basic needs.

As was expected and logical, Swami Dhirananda \ntook over the principal position of the school, and his colleague Swami Satyananda had \nto return from the Puri ashram. Dhirananda worked his post within the same protocol set \nby Yogananda, carrying out the responsibilities with perfect precision. Physically \nimpressive, magnetic, virtuous, somber, a strict disciplinarian and an acute observer and \nenforcer of rules, Dhirananda was not only respected by the students but was feared by \nthem as well. This was because he did not know how to forgive; errors had to be \npunished. This extremely stern side of Dhirananda’s character stood out in everyone’s \neyes. However, Swami Yogananda and Swami Satyananda were of a completely different \ncharacter. Love was the most prominent aspect of their nature. The writer has heard this \nfrom Satyanandaji: before any of them had become sannyasis, Mukunda had deep \naffection for Basu Kumar, almost as if he was entranced. But even Mukunda would be \ntaken aback by the sternness of Basu Kumar’s character and would comment, “My \nManomohan is the one who is good. You are much too ‘dry’!” In any case, with \nDhirananda heading the school and Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi providing \nfinancial support, the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya’s operations went on smoothly, and the \nnumber of students continued to grow. New renunciation-minded, well-educated and \nrighteously-directed students and teachers joined the institution. Particularly noteworthy \namong them was Kshitish Chandra Basu from Tutpara of the town of Khulna, located in \nwhat is known today as Bangla Desh. Handsome, intellectually sharp and eloquent in \nspeech, Kshitish Chandra was regarded with great respect by everyone within a very \nshort time. Because of the continuously growing number of students and the daily \nincrease of applications for new students, Maharaja Bahadur donated another palace for \nthe school’s use. This was a two-floor mansion located about four or five miles away \nfrom the ashram-school in an area called “Madhuban” in the Chota Nagpur area, on route \nto the Maharaja’s home in Rantu. The palace was situated on a forty-bigha [approx. 10 \nacres] expanse. This new “Madhuban” ashram was set up for students of the primary \ngrades. The Yogiraj’s grandson Ananda Mohan Lahiri was the first head of school for this \nbranch of the Ranchi Brahmacharya Vidyalaya. “Madhuban” was designated for teaching \nand housing students of primary levels, and the main school was for the students of the \nupper grades. The daily affairs of the branches were carried out by each branch on its \nown; however, for special occasions and events, the assemblies took place at the main \nbranch, and all of the faculty and students spent those days together. \n49 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Later, Yogananda would say that lack of success in life had no place in \nAmerica, and the only accepted and approved mark of success was financial prosperity – \nbeing a multimillionaire. And this was the mark of success regardless of the line of \nendeavor, whether one was a businessperson, worker or spiritual leader. If one was not \nwealthy, there was no practical way to be established. It was accepted that people should \npay to attend conferences; if a conference or lecture was free, then it was assumed that \nthere was nothing worthwhile to be gained from that lecture. There is a practice of \nceremonial financial offering at the time of spiritual initiation which is accepted \nthroughout India, that of “guru dakshina” [ceremonial offering to the guru]. In place of \nthe one-time offering of five-rupees as per the injunctions of dakshina in Kriya Yoga \ninitiations, Yoganandaji accepted five American dollars. But if one looked at the financial \nstate of that country, this donation was not enough for the priceless initiation of Kriya \nYoga. But Swamiji was not interested in these American ways of doing things; thus, the \nprocess of being established was extremely slow; one can even say that the import of the \nwork was negligible. But right when the state of affairs was in this kind of desperate \ncondition, Captain Rashid – Yoganandaji’s young friend-disciple whom he had met on the \nship during the return journey from Japan – suddenly appeared. Although Captain Rashid \nwas born as an Indian, his behavior and attitude was completely Western. Naturally open-\nhearted, he had great love for Swami Yogananda. Meeting him after many years, Captain \nRashid now came to know about Swamiji’s state of affairs in America. After hearing \neverything thoroughly, Captain Rashid said, “Swamiji! You’ll have to forget about the \nIndian ways of austerity and moving in this snail-like pace. You are in America now; if \nyou want to make roots here, you’ll have to master the ways and rules of this country. \nOtherwise, it would be much better for you to return to India.” Swamiji fell deeply into \nthought upon hearing Rashid’s words. He began to think, “It would be quite nice to have \nRashid assist me,” and other such things. Rashid was not formally employed anywhere at \nthat time. He was a wanderer at heart and spent his time traveling. Somehow provisions \ntook care of themselves. When Swamiji asked Rashid if he would like to help him in his \nwork, Rashid happily said that he would take full responsibility for building the \norganization. After Captain Rashid joined Yoganandaji in his work, the propagation \nmethods changed completely. He expertly arranged all of the necessities for high-level \npropagation – renting the best halls in whichever city they would be in, advertising in the \nmost respected newspapers of those cities, putting up posters with color pictures of \nSwamiji from street corner to street corner, and charging a proper entrance fee for the \nlectures. Right from the start, Carnegie Hall in New York was rented for a lecture. The \nrental cost for this hall was high; on top of that, the other preparations mentioned above \nwere also made. The entrance fee was set at one dollar. Rashid had done all of this on his \n50 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

He said, “Rashid! What have you done? There’s not enough money in the \nbank account to rent Carnegie Hall! If we can’t pay the rental fee, we’ll have to go to \njail!” When Yoganandaji was describing this situation to us, he commented, “It seemed \nthat Rashid believed in the efforts to cause a stir to bring people to Yogoda Satsanga even \nmore than I did. He said, ‘Swamiji, what are you saying? If we have to go to jail, then \nwe’ll continue with Yogoda Satsanga right from jail itself!”’ As it turned out, there was \nnot even space enough for a seed to be squeezed into the hall during the lecture, and \nSwamiji gave a beautiful talk as well. At the end of it, after all the expenses, they found \nthat they had made a few thousand dollars. The next day, an article came out in a \nrespected newspaper lauding Swamiji and his lecture. Of course, behind this too was \nRashid’s skillful maneuvering. From this point on, the name of “Yogoda” spread \nthroughout America, and Swami Yogananda was in high demand as lecturer, receiving \ninvitations from many cities and institutions. Money also began to come in abundance, \nand Yogoda centers were established in several cities. Now arose the necessity of having \nsomeone to manage this side of the organization; this was not in Captain Rashid’s area of \nexpertise. Thus, word was sent to India for his close friend Dhirananda to come to \nAmerica. All of Yoganandaji’s friends in India knew that Yoganandaji would not keep \nDhirananda apart from him for very long. In 1922, turning over all of the responsibilities \nof running the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya onto Swami Satyananda’s hands, Dhirananda left \nfor America. \n \n \nFounding the Headquarters at Mount Washington in Los Angeles \n \n \nSwami Yogananda breathed a great sigh of relief after Dhirananda’s arrival, as \nDhirananda’s skill in managing ashram-like institutions was well known. Handing over \nthe entirety of the organizational aspects of the work, Yogananda went on to give lectures \nthroughout the United States. Alongside propagation, there was also tremendous financial \ngain, and Yogoda Satsanga centers were set up in many cities. Swami Yogananda was \nnow well established in American society. Everyday people looked at him basically as a \nwealthy man worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. At this time – in 1925 – he visited \nthe city of Los Angeles in the state of California, which is situated in the west coast of the \nUnited States. This is the city which is also known for the fantasy land of the world of \nmotion pictures – Hollywood. While going about and seeing different sights of the city, \none day he went to visit an immense hotel on top of a large hill named Mount \nWashington. The industrial and crowded cities of America were mostly on the east coast. \nThe western coast of that vast country has rolling hills and mountains linked to mountain \nranges such as the Rocky Mountains, which are a bit further inland, running more or less \nin the same north-south direction as the coast. The eastern part is linked to a mountain \nrange comparatively lower in altitude to the Rockies – the Appalachian Mountains. The \nareas alongside the Appalachians are known for mines producing coal, iron, copper and \nother raw materials. One cannot see such huge deposits of so many different types of \nnatural resources located in such close proximity to each other in any other nation. This is \nwhy many factories, manufacturing plants and industries related to them were built in this \npart of the country. Easterners would often visit the west for holidays and health \n51 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

It was because of this that farsighted businessmen invested \nin building resorts, hotels and spas in places like Los Angeles and other cities of \nCalifornia. The site that Swamiji went to visit at Mount Washington was also a hotel, \nestablished by three friends who had formed a business partnership. Because of conflicts \nin interest among the partners, the hotel was closed for business and the entire property, \nincluding furnishings and land, was ready to be sold to an appropriate buyer. Swamiji had \nsaid to us that as soon as he set foot in the building, he immediately knew that that place \nbelonged to him. Finding out that the property was actually for sale, his assistants made \narrangements to acquire the sixteen acre property. The enormous hotel was purchased for \nforty five thousand dollars. At that time, three rupees equaled one dollar, which means \nthat the purchasing price of the property was one hundred thirty five thousand rupees. \nThe entire peak of the mount with the exception of one solitary acre was within the \nboundaries of this property. Later, even that one acre was acquired and became a part of \nthe center. The magnificent Mount Washington center is thought of as one of three \nprimary sites for tourists in Los Angeles, the other two being the world renowned \nHollywood and the city’s famous planetarium. The present [1983-84] value of that \nproperty is certainly not less than several hundred thousand dollars – quite likely much \nmore. The headquarters of the Self-Realization Fellowship (the name of the Yogoda \nSatsanga) in America were established at the center in Mount Washington. Yogananda’s \nhappiness knew no bounds; with the help of Dhirananda, he had established a permanent \nstructure from where Kriya Yoga could be spread. \n \n \nPropagation in Different American Cities – Meritorious Recognition by President \nCoolidge \n \n \nLeaving the responsibility of running the main center and consequently the work \nof the branch completely in the hands of Dhirananda – Swami Yogananda went on to \ntravel the whole of the United States, giving lectures, teaching Yogoda classes and \nestablishing new centers. By this time he was renowned in America for being a master \nspeaker. He later said to us that he was counted among the very best lecturers in the \ncountry. His compelling voice, beautiful and effortlessly flowing language, and speeches \nfull of spiritual feeling drew listeners in droves, sometimes spilling out of the hall and \nstanding on the street, listening to the talk through loudspeakers mounted outside the hall. \nOnce, in a lecture hall in the southern city of Miami, he had to give talks every day for a \nweek. Overflowing crowds kept packing the hall incessantly. Certain white religious \nleaders became envious of this phenomenon taking place. With heavily racist tones, they \nconspired to bring a false accusation against Swamiji and took the case to a court of law. \nThat state had always been infamous for its racism. Swamiji arrived in court on the day \nof the trial – radiant, magnetically attractive in form, with beautiful yet incisive eyes \nbrimming with virtue. When those eyes cast their gaze on the judge, the magistrate could \nnot withstand its power. “Away with that!”* he said. Regardless of the judge’s \ndiscomfort, Swamiji was cleared of all charges and walked away in dignity with the \nhighest respect of the court. The next day, most newspapers and journals had their \nheadlines boldly announcing the verdict, and Swamiji’s message of practical spirituality \n52 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Perhaps nothing exemplified the level of respect that \nYoganandaji had attained in America than when the man holding the highest position of \nall in that country – President Calvin Coolidge – invited him to the presidential mansion \n[the White House]. Yogananda was the very first Indian to have been honored by an \nAmerican president in this way. This event was extensively written about in the journals \nof India as well. When this writer and the one who is presently known as Swami \nShuddhananda went to have an audience with Sri Mahendra Nath Gupta, the author of \n“Sri Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita” [The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna], Sri “M” was \noverjoyed at the news and told us, “Please give Yogananda my heartfelt congratulations.” \nBecause of the increase in amount and complexity of the work in America, the need arose \nto bring more helpers from India. To fulfill this need, former graduate and founder of the \nstudents’ board of the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, Sri Jotindra Nath Banerjee – “Jotin-da” – \nleft for America as a “brahmachari” [celibate monk]. At first he was known as “Sri Jotin,” \npossibly following Swami Sriyukteshvarji’s precedent of using “Sri” as part of the \nmonastic name. Yogananda restarted this practice in America almost after two decades. \nLater however, Jotin-da was known by the more usual name of “Brahmachari Jotin” until \nhe was initiated according to scriptural injunctions into the Swami Order by his guru \nYoganandaji, after which he was known as Swami Premananda. From that time in 1928 \nuntil the present day [1983-84], Swami Premananda has lived in America. He is a man of \ngreat accomplishment; one of his greatest achievements has been being the only Asian in \nthe capital city of Washington, D.C. who has an ashram-temple situated on his own \npersonal residential property. There is no possibility any more for anyone to own such a \nproperty in that city because the United States Government secured all of the appropriate \navailable land many years ago for the future development of the capital. Like any other \ncapital city in any other nation, Washington is very well known for circulating gossip and \ncontroversy. For Swami Premananda to live in a city of this type for this long a period \nand still maintain the highest level of dignity and respect – much the same as Yoganandaji \n– up to the very present certainly reflects his great courage and abilities to interact \nskillfully and graciously with the surrounding society. There were several others besides \nSwami Premananda who took up the responsibilities of different centers set up by \nYoganandaji’s mission, such as Sri Nerode in Miami, Sri Ranendra Kumar in Cincinnati \nand Indianapolis and Sri Khagen in St. Louis. There were many American devotees who \nwere also given responsibilities for running different centers, such as Dr. Lewis in \nBoston, Dr. Rowan in Cleveland, Alice Gabler in Salt Lake, etc. Yoganandaji and \nDhirananda were in the Mount Washington center, and there were several American \nwomen devotees who were also there. In some places members of the same family were \nmembers in the organization as well, and they basically lived in the center’s quarters in a \npermanent sort of way. One can take for example the Wright family – the mother of the \nfamily, two sisters and two brothers. The youngest of the Wright sisters would become \nSister Daya and later Daya Mata, the head of the entire Yogoda Satsanga/Self-Realization \nFellowship worldwide. However, many of the participating branches previously \nmentioned are no longer connected in an official way to the main center. \n \n[*Translator’s note: The phrase in quotations is written in English in the original \nmanuscript.] \n \n53 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 55, "text": " \n \nIn order to be able to give the message of Kriya Yoga to large numbers of seekers, \nYoganandaji set up a way to spread the teachings through the written medium, which \nbecame known as “Precepta Lessons.” This method of study and testing can be seen in \nmany universities and other institutes of learning. A very influential American movement \nknown as “Christian Science” gained its popularity and strong foothold in spreading its \nphilosophy by teaching lessons via this very method. To propagate the teachings of Kriya \nYoga, Yogananda followed the same procedure set previously by the Christian Scientists. \nAs the philosophy spread to all parts of the globe, the income for the organization also \ngrew immensely, because there was an initial fee to receive the lessons and each lesson \nalso had a separate cost. In 1935, Yogananda said that his Kriya disciples or students in \nAmerican exceeded one hundred fifty thousand. It is needless to say that this amount of \ndiscipleship could have only happened through the above-mentioned lessons in print. In \nreality, there is reason to doubt whether Kriya can be given or taught properly by letters \nand circulars. After Yogananda’s passing, the Precepta Lessons were increased greatly in \nnumber and changes were also made to the original lessons. Yogananda’s American \ndisciples of earlier years were not happy with these changes. \n \n \nGeorge Eastman \n \n \nIt has already been mentioned that Yogananda was thought of as a wealthy man \nby ordinary Americans. The ashram had around six automobiles, and petrol guzzling cars \nsuch as the Pullman could only be afforded by persons of considerable means. And when \na person is wealthy, hordes of people show up to follow and praise him. Whenever \nYogananda would go to hotels and such places many such people would follow him \naround. Once he was at a hotel where one of the richest Americans – George Eastman – \nwas also staying. Being the inventor and producer of the Kodak camera, this man of \nimmense fortune was known worldwide. He had quite a few men and women following \nhim around as well. The hangers on from both sides became very excited about \nintroducing their leaders to each other, because getting important persons to meet each \nother was the usual practice in these types of situations. Swamiji’s devotees took him to \nmeet Eastman and both shook hands in greeting. As a gesture of courtesy, Eastman \ninvited Swamiji to see the Kodak laboratories. The offer of such an invitation in itself \nwas the height of civility and graciousness, what to say of receiving it from a man of such \ngreat fortune and fame as George Eastman. But Swamiji immediately replied, “Of \ncourse! I’m honored to accept your invitation, but on the condition that you first come to \nsee my ashram.” At first, Eastman was taken aback a bit; he did not expect Swami \nYogananda to attach a condition to the acceptance of his invitation. But because this \nproposition was made by Swamiji in front of onlookers, he had to accept in order to save \nface. Swamiji had said that when George Eastman visited Mount Washington, right from \nthe time he alighted from his car, he carried himself throughout his visit with the severity \nof a man well aware of his wealth and position. At one point he and Swamiji sat on a \nbench in the garden in front of the mansion. Eastman’s behavior was full of the \nunderlying feeling that he was doing Swamiji a favor by gracing the ashram with his \npresence. They were conversing, but Eastman’s responses were serious and very short; \nthere was no expression of any kind of openness. Suddenly, Swamiji looked directly at \n54 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

He was leaning regally on the backrest just \nbefore this statement; he now started to shrink down into the bench. Then he let go of all \nof his seriousness and began to talk to Yogananda open-heartedly, laughing and speaking \nfreely, and he spent a long time with Swamiji. George Eastman was an incredibly wealthy \nman, but he never gave any presents of his Kodak cameras. This time he broke his own \nrule. After returning home, he sent Swamiji a full set of Kodak photographic equipment \nas a gift. A short while after this meeting, George Eastman committed suicide, shooting a \nbullet from his own gun into his mouth. He left a note by his body saying, “Thy task is \ndone. Why wait?”* In his will, he left his vast wealth to be used for charitable work. \n \n[*Translator’s note: The quoted statement is in English in the original manuscript.] \n \n \nDhirananda Severs with Yogoda Satsanga and Encounters Illness \n \n \nIn the early 1930’s, Swami Yogananda’s personal life and Yogoda Satsanga’s \nwork faced an unimaginable breach. Because of a difference in views, Swami Dhirananda \nsevered all ties with Yogoda Satsanga, and furthermore, cut off all communication and \nended all relations with his beloved childhood friend Yogananda. What possibly could \nhave caused a friendship of such strength and depth to break in this way was not known. \nThereafter, Dhirananda set out to form another organization to spread the teachings of \nyoga. There was no questioning his erudition, intellectual brilliance and deftness at \naccomplishing goals, but perhaps he did not possess the kind of personality needed to \nattract a congregation, and perhaps he did not have the depth of mystic realization \nexpected of a spiritual leader. Dhirananda sent descriptive letters about his organization to \nSwamiji Maharaj Sriyukteshvarji and Acharya Shastri Mahasaya in India, seeking their \nwords of support. Sriyukteshvarji did not respond in any way whatsoever. All along, he \nhad disapproved of the extreme closeness with which Yogananda treated Dhirananda. \nHowever, Shastri Mahasaya did express his support for Dhirananda’s work. From this \npoint on, the two organizations worked separately at spreading the same spiritual \nmessage. Dhirananda’s leaving left Yogananda deeply hurt, but there was nothing that \ncould be done. He rejected all of Yogananda’s efforts at reconciliation. Some time before \n– around 1925-26 – the two friends had planted some fruit trees on the Mount \nWashington property. One mango tree among them was now bearing fruit. Seeing the \nmangoes as they were becoming ripe broke Yogananda’s heart. They had planted the trees \ntogether; one of them was now bearing fruit; how could he possibly eat these mangoes \nwithout sharing them with Dhirananda? Yogananda had said that Dhirananda was so \nproud that in no way could he be persuaded to ever set foot again in the Yogoda center. \nReligious leaders and associations now invited both institutions for their events. At that \ntime, once Yogananda was invited to a certain church. He was certain that Dhirananda \nwould also be invited. Before leaving for the occasion, Swamiji took one ripe mango and \nhid it in his pocket. When he arrived at the gathering, he saw that he had surmised \ncorrectly; Dhirananda was also there. However, their seats were quite a distance apart. \nAnd it seemed that Dhirananda did not want any eye contact to be made between them. \nFailing to get his attention, Yogananda seized an opportune moment and went and sat \n55 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 57, "text": " \nnext to Dhirananda. He leaned over and said, “Dhirananda, the mango tree we planted is \nnow bearing fruit! I’ve brought one for you!” Without even looking at Yogananda, \nDhirananda said disdainfully, “I have no time for you!”* This rejection struck Yogananda \nunfathomably deep; the pain was such that everything seemed be enveloped in darkness. \nAnd upon receiving this profound blow to the core of his being, Yogananda began to be \ngravely concerned about Dhirananda’s well being. He thought to himself, “Oh no! What \nterrible misfortune will come upon him now?” He had known from the past the types of \nrepercussions that could befall those who did him wrong. He began to fear that \nDhirananda may have to suffer some devastating consequence. When Yogananda was the \nhead of the Ranchi Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, he had seen an example of this type of \nramification, just a short while before he left for America. A brahmachari residential \nstudent named Dhiren was once looking at a picture of the Lord Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasaya \nand, for whatever reason, made some unflattering comment about the Yogiraj’s physical \nform. Yoganandaji was nearby. He became overcome with anger and the wrathful words \n“Your face will become twisted!” spewed forth from his mouth. Immediately, the boy’s \nface, head and neck turned to a crippled and twisted position. Because of this the boy \neventually had to leave the ashram. This writer had not yet enrolled in the school. Some \nof the students who were present at the time are still alive today. The boy’s home was on \nBechu Chatterjee Street. During 1934-35, when the Calcutta Yogoda Satsanga center and \nits students’ quarters – managed by the students’ committee at the time – were on 84 \nBechu Chatterjee Street, this poor man came to visit this writer several times. Neck and \nface twisted to one side, a handkerchief stuffed in his mouth to stop the uncontrollable \ndrooling, Dhiren could barely walk without swaying and his speech was slurred, having \ndifficulty forming words correctly with a crooked mouth. The purpose of his visits was to \nfind out when Swami Yogananda would return from America; Dhiren wanted to fall at his \nfeet and beg forgiveness. When Swamiji had returned, one day at his father’s house on \nRam Mohan Roy Street, Dhiren turned up. This writer was present at the house at the \ntime. Swamiji was getting ready to leave for someplace or other. He was taken aback \nupon seeing Dhiren, but did not recognize him. This writer introduced the cursed fellow \nand refreshed Swamiji’s memory about the past incident. By this time, Dhiren had \ntouched Swamiji’s feet. Yoganandaji looked at him with deep compassion, but there was \nno change in the man’s condition. Swamiji did not have the power to take back the curse \nwhich had sprung forth spontaneously from his heart. Although nothing immediately \nhappened to Dhirananda after his harsh rejection of Yogananda, he fell very ill only a few \ndays afterwards. So serious was the infirmity that he had to be hospitalized. It took about \nthree months of hospital stay for him to recover. But this stay in the hospital profoundly \nchanged the course of Dhirananda’s life. The tender, selfless and ceaseless care of a nurse \nat the hospital helped him regain his health. He fell in love with this kind-hearted woman. \nSubsequently, he reassumed his family-given name of Basu Kumar Bagchi and left the \npath of sannyas. The bond of affection and love that had blossomed between Mukunda \nLal and Basu Kumar from the beginnings of their youth and which continued later as \nYogananda and Dhirananda – a relationship that seemed inseparable – now had no \npossibility of reunion or reconciliation. Although this friendship was not one that his \nGurudev had looked upon favorably, this love had held Yogananda’s heart all these years. \nBut the curtain had now fallen on that act in the drama. \n \n56 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Dhirananda and Satyananda were the ones \nwho fulfilled that lack. Leaving Satyananda to run the Ranchi Brahmacharya Vidyalaya \nand having Dhirananda at his side in America, the propagation of the mission was \nmoving along quite well and easily. Now Dhirananda was gone and the entire \nresponsibility of running the headquarters of the institution was left in Yogananda’s \ninexperienced hands. Naturally the result was problematic. He was never fully abreast of \nthe income and expenses of the ashram, neither could this be expected of him. With \nunshakeable faith in God and the lineage of masters, brimming with divine spiritual \nconsciousness, carrying out the propagation of Kriya Yoga and witnessing its massive \nsuccess, Yogananda remained totally absorbed in the beautiful way his life was playing \nout. One afternoon, he was about to leave the ashram grounds to go somewhere in the \ncity. His car was ready outside. Right at that time, one of the secretaries came downstairs \nand presented him with a notice from the electric company. The letter said that the \nashram still had one thousand dollars outstanding and if this amount was not fully paid by \nthe final due date given on the notice, the electricity would be completely shut off. And \nthe secretary said that the worse part of it all was that there was practically nothing left in \nthe bank. Swamiji was heavily distressed. Known as one of the wealthy men of America \nand reputed for establishing Yogoda Satsanga throughout the country, finding himself in \nthis desperate financial predicament was certainly a very worrisome thing. He \nimmediately sent the car back to the garage, and instead took the House Car and speedily \ndrove away until he reached an area of the desert about fifteen miles from the ashram. It \nhas already been mentioned that Los Angeles is rich in natural splendor. Situated by the \nocean, Los Angeles also has deep forests, hot and dry desert areas, as well as mountains \nin the same area of land. It is as if God beautifully decorated this city on every side and \nplaced it on the Earth. Reaching the desert and parking the car on the side of the highway, \nSwamiji began to walk on the desert sand. He went quite a distance and then sat down in \nasana right on the sand, and began to cry out his deepest concerns and pains to the \nMother of the Universe. When he was describing this later, he said that he kept saying, \n“O Mother of the Universe! I’m just a sannyasi, I did not ask for fame or fortune – \nnothing at all! Why give me all of this and then have the pressure of financial want \nthrown upon me?!” Swamiji did not remember for how long he continued to bring out all \nof his grief in this way. The desert was desolate and night was growing deep. Completely \nimmersed in his wailing, suddenly he heard someone far away saying, “Ma bhaih! Ma \nbhaih!” All of his anguish instantly vanished upon hearing this sacred chant. Swamiji felt \nthat this was a sign that the Divine Mother had heard his aching call and was giving him \n58 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

He got up off of the desert floor, walked back to the \nhighway where he had left the House Car and drove straight back to Mount Washington. \nSwamiji went directly to his room, without speaking or looking at anyone in the ashram, \nand locked his door. At quite another place, an extraordinary and related event took place \nthat night; that will be brought to light shortly. A few days after Swamiji’s prayers in the \ndesert, the ashram received a check for a large sum from an unknown person, \naccompanied by a message saying that he would like to visit the ashram on a certain day. \nThe donation relieved the organization’s financial woes for the time being. Yoganandaji \nknew that this unexpected gift was a demonstration by the lineage of the masters and the \nMother of the Universe, but he told no one about this understanding and kept it \ncompletely to himself as he secretly and silently bowed in gratitude for this blessed gift \nfrom the Divine. This unknown benefactor’s name was Mr. Lynn. On the specified date \nof his arrival, Swamiji told everyone that if some person by the name of Mr. Lynn should \ncome, he should be taken directly to the prayer chapel of the ashram. Swamiji himself \nwas in the chapel, seated in asana and meditating. Mr. Lynn arrived and was taken to see \nSwamiji in the prayer house. Swamiji later said, “Immediately upon Lynn setting foot in \nthe prayer house, I saw the entire room of the chapel filled with a blue light. I gave him \nKriya right away, at that time!” After he entered the chapel Lynn was struck by seeing the \nform of Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasaya on the altar and he said in astonishment, “This is the \nvery same saint that came to me in a dream and asked me to send a donation to the \nashram!” Lynn went on to describe the dream. The same night when Yoganandaji went to \nthe desert to pray, he had had this dream where he saw an Indian sage asking him to send \nsome financial help to Swami Yogananda. Because of some difference in views, Lynn \nwas at that time living separately from his wife. He was an internationally reputed \nbusinessman and possessor of immense wealth and property. Although he had absolutely \nno lack in material abundance, he was suffering at the time from marital problems. And \nthen came this dream. Lynn did not especially believe nor was he much interested in \nreligion. But he had plenty of money for charity, and he decided to send a donation to \nSwami Yogananda and see what it would be like to meet him. This supernatural event of \nthe dream is the hidden chapter behind the story of the ashram receiving an unexpected \nfinancial donation and the donor wishing to visit the Mount Washington center. \nYoganandaji gave Kriya Yoga initiation according to traditional injunctions to Lynn there \nat this first meeting. Immediately upon the completion of the initiation, Lynn went into a \ndeep meditative trance and remained unmoving in asana for over an hour. From this day \non, Mr. Lynn would come to the ashram almost daily, and when he would come, he \nwould go straight to the prayer house and become absorbed in Kriya Yoga and \nmeditation. Often no one knew when he left for home. Because he was a man of such \nwealth and at the same time so deeply devoted to the practice of Kriya Yoga, the regular \npresence of Mr. Lynn changed the atmosphere of the ashram. The respect and love for \nSwamiji deepened. The void that was left in Yogananda’s life after Dhirananda’s \ndeparture was filled for the most part by the appearance of Lynn. The propagation work \nin America again moved forward with even greater ease. \n \n \nDirecting and Managing the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya – Swami Satyananda \n \n59 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 61, "text": " \n \nAfter Swami Dhirananda left for America, the Ranchi Brahmacharya Vidyalaya \nunderwent different advancements under the direction of Swami Satyananda. Swami \nYogananda was a dreamer type of being; forgetting about Ranchi or seeing Ranchi as \nbeing lesser in priority while consumed by new circumstances in America was not a \nsurprising thing. The hope was that Dhirananda would keep Yogananda aware of the \noperations and events in Ranchi. But that was for naught. Instead, it was heard that \nDhirananda was completely uninterested in Ranchi matters and he felt that whatever was \ngoing on in the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya was of not much importance at all. On this side, \nthe young Swami Satyananda – the youngest of the previous triumvirate – continued to \ndirect the Ranchi school as he best saw fit with co-workers of the same age or slightly \nolder than him. He regularly sent word to his spiritual brother and leader Yogananda, \nkeeping him abreast of the goings on in Ranchi. When Swami Satyananda took on the \nmantle of director, all of India was alive with a nationalist consciousness. Led by \nMahatma Gandhi, India in 1921 was astir countrywide with the independence movement \nthrough non-violent civil resistance. If other ideologies or cultural and societal activities \ndid not follow the same line, they were either not given much weight, or looked at in an \nunfavorable light. The Ranchi Vidyalaya also was not free from this atmosphere. The \nfreedom movement consisted primarily of well-schooled youths, and the teachers and \nstudents of the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya were all highly educated young men; it was only \nnatural that the nationwide uprising would stir them as well. In any case, the monthly \nfinancial support from Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi continued unabatedly, and the \nnumber of students continued to increase. The school now had a reputation throughout \nthe land for not only upholding and teaching the ancient ideals of India, but also for \nmoving progressively with the ideas of independence and national self-reliance that had \nnow gripped the nation. At this time – among several others – two scholarly young \nteachers joined the school, Ashwini Kumar Datta and Shishir Kumar Raha. Both had \ncompleted their college studies and taken up Gandhiji’s motto of non-violent civil \nresistance. Following the initial uprisings, they became fully involved in spreading the \nmessage of national freedom. It has to be admitted that because of many such young \npeople joining the school, the fundamental philosophy of the Ranchi Brahmacharya \nVidyalaya went through some changes. The founder and his assistants had dedicated their \nlives to the path of Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasaya’s Kriya Yoga. Now, although the school was \nstill spiritually oriented, other ideologies, such as nationalism, also found important \nplaces in the collective mentality of the school. However, Lahiri Baba’s path was still \nheld in the highest position, above all else, and the practice of celebrations at certain \nastrologically significant times of the year – according to the precedent set by Swamiji \nMaharaj Sriyukteshvarji – went on regularly. But the students no longer had an \nideological unity as before. Of course, it must be understood that the high ideals of civil \nresistance would take hold more easily in the tender minds of young people. Here are \nsome examples of the differences within the faculty: Shashi-da – Shashi Bhushan Ghosh \n– was a mantra-initiated disciple of Sri Sri Mata Sarada Moni [wife of Sri Sri \nRamakrishna Paramhansa]; Kshitish-da – Kshitish Chandra Basu – was a disciple of the \ngreat Vaishnav guru Sri Sri Radharaman Charan Das Babaji; Ashwini Kumar was a \ndisciple of Sri Sri Swami Bholananda Maharaj of Hardwar; and Shishir Kumar was a \ndisciple of the Videha Mahanta Sri Sri Santa Das Babaji. These devotees of these \ndifferent luminary saints also held Sri Sri Lahiri Baba in the highest regard. Although this \n60 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

The person whom Satyanandaji relied upon to help prevent a \ndisruptive situation was Ananda-da, Yogiraj’s grandson Ananda Mohan Lahiri. However, \nthe real power – financial power – was still under Satyanandaji’s control, at least as long \nas financial support continued to come from Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi. And \nthis aid gradually became less and less, as part of the management of the affairs of his \nproperties came under the control of a holding company. Subsequently this control had to \nbe turned over to the governmental Court of Wards. The previous flow of revenue and \nexpenditures resulting from doing business as a private landowner inevitably came under \ngreater restrictions now that the proprietorship was in the government’s hands. Funds for \nthe various charitable institutions and works liberally provided by the Maharaja were \nsignificantly curtailed. These budget restrictions also eventually affected the \nBrahmacharya Vidyalaya, leading to a lessening of the monthly aid that the school \nreceived. After the passing of the magnanimous Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi in \n1929, even this aid came to an end. The author at that time had completed his studies at \nthe Vidyalaya and was beginning his college years. How far the financial restrictions had \ngone can easily be seen by examining the money allotted for the Maharaja’s funeral in \ncomparison to other events of similar importance in the past. The Maharaja’s grandson’s \nannaprasan [Hindu christening] cost four hundred thousand rupees; that same valiantly \ngenerous Maharaja’s funeral was allotted only fifty thousand rupees. It is heard that the \nQueen Mother took another fifty thousand out of her own depository to somehow be able \nto carry out the funeral. The Brahmacharya Vidyalaya was invited to the memorial \nservice, and along with Swami Satyanandaji, the author and Parimal Kanti, another \ngraduate of the school, were also present at Kashim Bazar. Although solemn, the royal \nservice seemed quite lavish to the writer and his friend, but the older dignitaries present \nknew the splendor with which events such as these were held in the past, and seeing what \nthey considered to be tightfisted arrangements, they commented that the Maharaja \nhimself should have kept aside and specified a proper amount to be spent for his own \nfuneral. From this event, one can see the financial condition the Maharaja’s estate was in \nat that time. Raising funds for the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya became a matter of great \nconcern. Still, regardless of many problems, the school continued to “hold its course,” \nmainly because of Swami Satyananda’s cool head and enterprising mind. Somehow the \nideals of Lahiri Mahasaya were kept alive at this yogic educational institution and the \nmembers of the faculty did not have to take up an alternative philosophy in order to \ncontinue. However, the nationalistic atmosphere gripping the nation was quite present at \nthe school. Kshitish Chandra Basu – Kshitish-da – was appointed to the position of \npresident/director for the Ranchi branch of the Congress party, and he eventually became \na member of the “Gandhi Seva Sangha,” the organization which was set up and supported \nby an icon of renunciation and public service – a man who was known as “Manabhuma \nGandhi” – Sri Nibaran Chandra Dasgupta of Puruliya.  In the words of Netaji Subhas \nChandra Bose, the Gandhi Seva Sangha was the “iron foundry” for those carrying out \nGandhiji’s message. Thereafter, to direct the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya more along the \nlines of these new open-minded ways and nationalism, a new, parallel institution was \nfounded, called “Brahmacharya Sangha.” The Ranchi Vidyalaya became the central \nschool of the sangha [association]. Satyanandaji was appointed as this sangha’s first \npresident. He had no choice but to accept this position, although he maintained that he \n61 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

At the time of this conflicted \nsituation, the members of the Ranchi Brahmacharya Vidyalaya’s Graduated Students’ \nCommittee – founded by Jotin-da, or Brahmachari Jotin, later known as Swami \nPremananda – were the only ones on Swami Satyananda’s side, determined to keep total \ncontrol of the school’s finances in Satyanandaji’s hands. After Brahmachari Jotin left for \nAmerica, the responsibilities of managing the operations of this committee were turned \nover primarily to Sailesh Mohan and this writer. It seems appropriate here to write about \nsome of the methodology by which the school was run. Familiarity with these procedures \nand practices will shed light on how the ideals and goals of the institution were realized. \n \n \nThe meals served at the school were completely vegetarian [lacto-vegetarian]. On \ncertain astrologically significant days of the month, arrangements were made for the food \nrestrictions specified for those days. Milk and sometimes ghee were served during the \nmain meals at midday and evening. Each student had a plate, bowl and drinking glass, \nwhich each was responsible for cleaning and maintaining. Besides the main meals, light \nrepasts were taken twice a day, which the students themselves served. The students also \nattended to seeing guests, taking care of those who may be ill, seeing to the needs of the \nteachers and other such usual duties of the ashram. One of the five heads of the Students’ \nCommittee – appointed by the committee itself – acted as director as well as liason \nbetween the faculty, the heads of school and the students. The times for carrying out the \nvarious duties of the day and night were made known by the ringing of a bell. Once a \nweek, the director of the committee announced the names of specific persons who would \nbe appointed to carry out the essential duties during the week, including the name of the \nbell ringer. Historically, the school had a policy of emphasizing a respectful attitude \ntoward those who were assigned the weekly tasks and discouraging the students from \nforming exclusive groups; this was partially accomplished by selecting the appointees for \nthe week by secret and anonymous voting. It is quite amazing to realize how open and \nunbiased the students were. The bell-ringing duty was a very important one. The ringer’s \njob was to strike the bell exactly in line with the hands of the clock at specified times, \nsignaling the beginning of a period in which to carry out some necessary activity of the \nday or evening. If a person did not discipline himself to have a keen sense of time, giving \nhim such a job would not only be useless but a detriment to the workflow of the ashram. \nThe ringing of the bell announced all of the various parts of the entire program of the day, \nfrom pre-dawn brahmamuhurta [time of God] – when it rang to awaken the residents and \nget them out of bed – till the time to go to sleep at night. In any year, this duty was only \nentrusted to two or three select students and not given to others. There were also specific \nways of ringing the bell. If the bell was heard distinctly as one stroke, and then another \nstroke and so on – one stroke at a time – that was a signal for: 1) arising at \nbrahmamuhurta, 2) the time of respite or the ending of class during the time of day when \nclass was held, or 3) the time to go to bed after the evening meal.* If the bell was struck \nwith two strokes close together – two at a time and then two more and so on – that \nsignaled everyone to gather at the prayer house after dawn or after dusk for daily prayers. \nIf there were three strokes at a time – three and then three more and so on – that \nannounced the beginning of class; classes were held outdoors under trees in the garden of \nthe school, each class under a separate tree. Hearing four strokes at a time was nectarous \nto the students’ ears as that signaled the meals, any of the two main ones or the two light \n62 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Five quick strokes at a time announced the time of body and hair oiling and the \nsubsequent time of bathing. Before the time of bathing as well as after finishing \nhomework in each student’s respective rooms, eight strokes grouped together and \nrepeated told everyone that it was the time for working on different crafts and practical \nskills. Skills such as weaving, sewing, bookbinding, first aid, simple horticulture etc. \nwere taught by certain teachers with expertise in these various areas. After the time of \nbathing, the bell was struck with nine strokes at a time, telling everyone to gather at the \nprayer room, this time for the fervent recitation of sacred verses in song form. If the \nallotted work was not accomplished up to this point, then the bell was not rung for the \nfour-stroke signal that was to come next and was kept silent, and that signal was for the \nannouncement of the midday meal. Thus it can be seen that the carrying out of the entire \nprogram of the day depended upon the orderly ringing of the bell. There was a special \nsignal of three separate strokes which was a call for everyone to gather in front of the \nprayer house, no matter what the activity one may be engaged in at the time. This was \nusually a sign that a special announcement was to be given to everyone by the head of \nschool himself. This happened usually during summertime, particularly during bright \nfortnights, sometime close to the time of the full moon. The head of school would \nannounce an outing for the students to some serene place in the hills or some nearby \nforest; often a picnic of some sort was held. When Yoganandaji was the president of the \nschool, this practice was more or less a regular one. It was basically the same during \nSatyanandaji’s time as well. The wonderful memories of those days still bring back the \njoys and thrills of youth even for those former students who have now passed into their \ntwilight years. \n \n[*Translator’s note: It is usual practice in India to eat the evening meal right before \nretiring for the night.] \n \n \nThere were age limits set for enrollment as residential students at the ashram-\nschool. Students could only enter the residential program if they were between eight and \ntwelve years of age. Applications for entrance below or above these limits were rejected. \nIt was under Satyanandaji’s directorship that exceptions were made regarding this strict \nrule. The rule was first broken for what seemed to be a singular reason, but afterwards the \nrestrictions were overlooked many other times. There was an interesting event behind this \nas well. Satyendra Nath Mukherjee of the town of Howrah was a residential student of \nShantiniketan [Rabindranath Tagore’s school]; he was past the age of twelve. At that \ntime, Shantiniketan’s head of school was an Englishman by the name of Pearson who was \nvery fond of Satyendra Nath. The boy loved religious practices but there was no \nenvironment for that at Shantiniketan. Pearson kept himself fully abreast of the different \nestablishments in India advocating traditional Indian culture. After thinking about it \ndeeply, he decided that it would be good for Satyendra Nath to enroll in the Ranchi \nBrahmacharya Vidyalaya. Satyendra Nath no longer had his mother and father; he had \nonly an elder brother for a guardian, and he was also quite young. Thus, the possibility of \nSatyendra Nath’s elder brother going against this proposition could not arise at all, \nparticularly when a man of such high scholarly status as Mr. Pearson suggested it. \nPearson himself took the initiative and wrote to the head of school of the Brahmacharya \nVidyalaya, asking permission for Satyendra Nath to be enrolled as a residential student in \n63 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 65, "text": " \nRanchi. Because the boy was past the age of twelve, Satyanandaji cordially wrote that \nbecause of age restrictions, he regretfully could not accept Satyendra Nath as a student. \nThe letter that Pearson wrote in return, upon receiving the note of rejection, was the \nreason that this strict age-limit rule was first broken. Satyanandaji told us, “Mr. Pearson \nopened my eyes. He said, ‘Children are like the softest clay. Whatever container they are \nput in determines the shape they will take. It is not at all right to reject a student just \nbecause he is slightly older than the age limit allows.’” Satyendra Nath was thus \naccepted, although somewhat as an experiment. Mr. Pearson himself came with the boy \nto enroll him and stayed on as a guest of the school for a few days. And Satyendra Nath \ntruly did turn out to be an ideal student of the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya. Although he was \nnot particularly good at studies, when it came to conducting worship services, tending to \nthe ill, serving elders and other such service-oriented activities, he carried these out \nperfectly, in line with the highest standards of the ashram. On top of this, his respect for \nall people, especially elders, and his cheerful and lighthearted nature won over everyone’s \nhearts. In due time, Satyendra Nath was initiated into the path of Kriya Yoga by Acharya \nShastri Mahasaya, and later, he formally took the vows of a “brahmachari” [celibate \nrenunciate] with the rites performed by Hardwar’s Mahatma Swami Bholananda Giri, \nafter which he was known as “Brahmachari Satyananda.” Just before Bholananda \nMaharaj left his body, he bestowed on his primary disciple Swami Mahadevananda the \ntitle of “head of temple.” Following Bholanandaji’s directions and conducting the \nceremony in his very presence, Swami Mahadevananda initiated Brahmachari \nSatyananda into the path of sannyas, giving him the name of Swami Sanakananda Giri. \nSanakananda was the first sannyas initiate of Swami Mahadevananda after \nMahadevanandaji became the head of temple of Bholanandaji’s sannyas-ashram, and \naccording to precedence, Sanakanandaji had the right to succeed Mahadevanandaji for \nthe seat of the temple head. But Sanakanandaji did not stay long at the Hardwar ashram. \nIn the city of Oudh [Ayodhya], a matted-haired sage left the sum of one hundred \nthousand rupees in Sanakanandaji’s name before he left this life. Sanakanandaji took this \ngift and built an expansive institution dedicated to social service. Ever drawn to treat the \ninfirm, Swami Sanakanandaji was a certificated homeopathic doctor, and was well known \nin that region [Ayodhya] particularly for his treatments of eye-problems. Everyone \nreferred to him as “Doctor Maharaj.” His personality was also very influential in this part \nof Uttar Pradesh [name of province], so much so that he was nominated to run as a \nparliamentary representative for the Ayodhya area against a member of the powerful \nCongress Party. Sanakanandaji lost to the Congress Party member by only a few votes. \nAround 1978-79 he left this mortal plane. He traveled to many parts of Europe, \nAfghanistan and other countries, leaving a legacy of reverence and respect – seen by \nmany as their guru – and being known throughout as one who exemplified spiritual \nrichness. Satyendra Nath’s model life set a high standard indeed for students at the \nBrahmacharya Vidyalaya to reach for many years to come. Swami Satyanandaji was \nsuccessful in his experiment when he overlooked the age-limit rule regarding Satyendra \nNath; he later relaxed these reins several times and was successful in those cases as well. \nThis writer himself was able to study as a residential student at the Brahmacharya \nVidyalaya because of Satyanandaji’s loose interpretation of this regulation. \n \n \n64 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

The worsening of the estate’s financial solvency began to be evident \ntowards the end of the Maharaja’s life. In order to resolve these fiscal problems, the \nmanagement of the estate was handed over to an English firm by the name of Guilenders, \nbut in the end all business affairs of the estate were assumed by the Court of Wards of the \ngovernment. At this time, the Maharaja came to Ranchi for a health respite. He rented an \nimmense mansion by Bariatu Hill, quite a distance away from the ashram. One day, this \nwriter accompanied Satyanandaji on a visit to see the Maharaja at that rented house. It \nwas strange to see this king who owned two palatial mansion-estates in Ranchi having to \nrent a house for his retreat. It was as if he had become like the “babui” bird [the weaver \nbird having to weave yet another nest]. Ironically, both of his mansions in Ranchi were \nbeing used by the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya. In conversation, the Maharaja expressed his \nperturbation at the Guilenders firm and said that in the name of improving the financial \ncondition of the estate, they were trying to find a way to shut down the Brahmacharya \nVidyalaya and stop the programs of village education supported by the Maharaja. How \nmuch the Maharaja loved and respected the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya can be seen by his \nactions at this time. Renting this place regardless of owning the palaces used by the \nVidyalaya, he even invited all of the residents of the ashram for a massive midday meal at \nhis rented retreat. Everyone, from the little “brahmachari” children to the scholarly \nteachers and administrators, came for the feast. The time had moved well into the second \npart of the day, but because brahmacharis [saintly ascetics] had not yet been fed, \neveryone at the house had maintained a full fast – without even water – until that point [a \nHindu custom]. When Swami Satyanandaji was made aware of this, he asked the \nMaharaja to please not continue with this kind of suffering. The Maharaja’s son, Prince \nNandi, was standing right next to his father. The king poked his son’s belly with his right \nindex finger and said, “I don’t have a problem with this. Look at him. He seems to have \nplenty in his stomach!” The tall, powerfully built and handsome prince was a bit \nembarrassed by his father’s humorous remark. Everyone laughed. The Maharaja himself \nstood there and directed the servants until the child “brahmacharis” had finished eating, \nand towards the end he even began to serve the ashram-students by his own hand. \nEveryone was amazed at the venerable king’s devotion and reverence to those who were \nfar below his age and social status. Quickly, the Maharaja’s son-in-law more or less \nforcefully snatched the pot of sweets from his father-in-law and took over the role of \nserving everyone the last part of the meal. This event demonstrated the true nature of the \nvaliantly magnanimous Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi’s heart. \n \n \nAnother financially related matter – the founding of the Brahmacharya Sangha \nand making the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya as its center – has also been previously \nmentioned.

It was as if the scene was set \nfor everything to go well under the patronage of Mr. Lynn. On the other side, it was \nimportant for several reasons for Yoganandaji to return to India, not the least of which \nwas his first major “creation by will” – the Ranchi Brahmacharya Vidyalaya. The \npreconceived return became reality in 1935. One day, Yoganandaji was in a \nsuperconscious state and heard the call of his Gurudev asking Swamiji to come to him, \nindicating that the great master’s time to leave the mortal frame was at hand, and if \nYogananda did not come as soon as possible, there would never again be another chance \nto see each other physically. Swamiji was overcome with restlessness and wanted to run \nto his Gurudev. But the funds to travel to India were not available at the time. \nNevertheless, Swamiji had completely made up his mind that he will make the trip back \nto India without a scintilla of doubt. The ashram-residents close to him became \nconcerned. How will the travel expenses be met? When word of this got to Mr. Lynn, he \nimmediately took it upon his own shoulders to meet any costs necessary for \nYoganandaji’s trip. He also suggested that Swamiji should see some other parts of the \nworld by automobile during his travel before finally setting foot on his motherland. In \n66 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

And Mr. Lynn provided Swamiji the \nmoney for all of the costs – those of taking that car on a ship across the world and on \ntrains in those parts of the world, automobile maintenance, petrol costs, insurance, and \nthe expenses of Swamiji and his two assistants traveling with him. Thus Swamiji’s return \ntrip to home was arranged to be in royal fashion. \n \n \nOn this side in India, before word of Yoganandaji’s return was even received, an \nincredible event related to his coming back took place in Ranchi. Swami Satyanandaji \nwas in Ranchi at the time. In the temple room of the prayer cottage, there was a Shiva \nlingam, an enormous picture of Yogiraj Lahiri Baba hanging on the wall, and a full-body \npicture of Yoganandaji – drawn by Sananda Lal – on an easel. There was another door to \nthat temple room, located on the side of the No. 4 Ward. During the hot summer, the \nresidents would sometimes keep that door open to let in a cool breeze. One night, a \nstudent from that ward suddenly woke up from sleep and saw through that door that \nSwami Yogananda’s radiant form seemed to be coming out of that picture in the temple \nroom. The student became frightened when he saw this supernatural scene. In the \nmorning he told Satyanandaji of the event. Swamiji did not say anything at all to the \nstudent at that time, but he later told this writer, “When I heard about that incident, I \nknew that the ‘boss’ was definitely coming this time. I’ve seen these types of things \nhappen around him [Yogananda] at other times, since we were children!” Just a few days \nafter this event, a letter from Yoganandaji arrived in Calcutta, saying that he had begun \nhis journey back to India. \n \n \nForming a Welcoming Committee for a City-wide Reception in Calcutta \n \n \nAfter fifteen long years of residing in distant America, Yoganandaji’s return in the \nsixteenth year as the pride of Mother India naturally caused a nationwide stir. And there \nwas no end to the expectant excitement and joy felt by those friends, relatives, students \nand disciples who had been blessed to have had his company, as well as the graduated \nand presently enrolled students of the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya who had held \nYoganandaji in their hearts as their ideal role model although they had never seen him. \nNot only were they excited about seeing him in person, but a new hope had arisen that his \narrival would bring on a new and torrential current of progress at the Brahmacharya \nVidyalaya and Yogoda Satsanga. At that time, other than the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, \nthe only centers whose work was related to the practice of the Kriya Yoga of Lahiri \nMahasaya were a students’ association and residence run by graduates of the ashram-\nschool and the Yogoda Satsanga of Calcutta. Thus, the responsibility of the best possible \nwelcoming preparations for Yoganandaji fell on this association and the Yogoda center as \na matter of course. The chairman of the students’ association and residence at the time \nwas Sri Ramendra Nath Das. Ramen-da and co-presidents Sailesh Mohan Majumdar* \nand Sailendra Bejoy Dasgupta (this writer) were the administrators. Looking after \nresidential matters was Sailendra Bejoy’s responsibility. Sudhir Chandra Roy – Sudhir-da \n– regularly stayed in the students’ quarters. Immediately upon receiving news of \nSwamiji’s return, an urgent meeting to assemble a welcoming committee was called by \n67 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 69, "text": " \nthe association. Many of the graduates of the Vidyalaya were present at this meeting. Sri \nBishnu Charan Ghosh was especially asked to attend. Although Bishnu Charan was not \nan official graduate of the Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, the right to make this demand of him \nwas nevertheless proper. When Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi had first visited \nYoganandaji’s tiny shack of an ashram in the slums of Calcutta, Bishnu Charan was there, \ndressed as a child-brahmachari to welcome the Maharaja. But the main reason for asking \nhim to come was because he was Yoganandaji’s youngest brother and he was known in \nthe exclusive circles of Calcutta. The weight of responsibility to form the welcoming \ncommittee was put on Bishnu Charan, and, along with him, on this author. Bishnu \nCharan’s task was to gain the support of the dignitaries of the city and put together a \nwelcoming committee of set members, and this writer’s work was to go to Bishnu \nCharan’s house – morning and evening, hurry him out of the house and then go together \nin his car to meet the elite and distinguished people of Calcutta. Among those in the \nassembled welcoming committee were: the successor Maharaja Nandi of Kashim Bazar, \nSantosh’s maharaja Manmath Nath Roy Choudhury, Mr. Bijoy Pramad Singharoy, Mr. \nHari Shankar Pal, Lt. Col. Mr. Hassan Suravardi, the former mayor of the Calcutta \nCorporation and public leader Santosh Kumar Basu, and several other such eminent \ncitizens. Santosh Kumar Basu was appointed president of the committee. It was arranged \nthat when Yoganandaji arrived, he would be garlanded on behalf of the citizens of \nCalcutta by the then mayor of the Calcutta Corporation – and the future Sher-e-Bangla – \nMaulavi Fazlul Haq. \n \n[*Note: Sailesh Mohan Majumdar  later became Swami Shuddhananda Giri.] \n \n \nOn the Way Back to India with His Companions and Traveling in Different \nCountries \n \n \nAccompanying Yoganandaji on his return journey to India were Charles Richard \nWright – the brother of the one who is presently known as Daya Mata – and Miss Ettie \nBletch, who was a sister [female devotee] at the Mount Washington center. Wright was a \nyoung man who was capable of driving an automobile and who served as Swamiji’s \npersonal secretary. Ettie Bletch was middle aged and was Swamiji’s attendant. The three \nof them traveled in the new automobile from the west coast of the United States to the \neast coast metropolis of New York and boarded a ship headed for London. The car was \nput aboard the ship. On the way to New York, another person joined them for the \noverseas journey, a young man who was the son of Dr. Lewis, the wealthy patron and \nfollower from Boston whose support had been so essential during the early days in \nAmerica. After arriving in London, Wright had the car released from the ship, and that car \ntook Swamiji to many places of attraction in England and Scotland. The English \nnewspapers had announced his presence in Britain. There were many transplanted Indians \nas well as British men and women who were lovers of Indian philosophy and spirituality, \nand they wanted to at least see Yoganandaji with their own eyes and possibly hear him \ngive a talk. Lectures were set up in many places. Most of these were managed and \nconducted by Kedar Nath Dasgupta, the founder of the Vishva Dharma Sammelan, who \nalso introduced Swamiji to the audiences at the lectures. The biggest of the talks took \n68 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

The attendance was so large at this immense hall that \nthere was no room to even stand. Swamiji’s profound and powerful lecture, filled with \nenergy and spiritual wisdom, captivated the hearts of everyone there. He went to Scotland \nby car as well, particularly because of a personal invitation by the distinguished citizen \nSir Harry Lowder. After spending a few days on Scottish lands, Yoganandaji and his \nfellow travelers crossed the English Channel from the port of Dover in England to the \nport of Calais in France. Of course, the car was with them. From here they traveled by \nthat automobile to many parts of Europe, such as France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, \nHolland, Switzerland etc. Hitler had begun to rise in Germany at that time and the entire \ncountry was being molded to a new set of uniformity and rules. The scenes in that land at \nthat time brought up feelings of great admiration in Yoganandaji. He used to say that the \nentire German nation was alive, and that it was absolutely mesmerizing to see groups of \nyoung men marching together with the “clack, clack” sounds of their boots resonating in \nunison. Little did he know that this so-called “beautifully arranged garden” would be \nobliterated to dust within a decade and fall into the horrific annals of history. The most \nsignificant part of the travel in Germany was seeing the world-renowned, God-\nintoxicated female saint Theresa Neumann. This great woman was distinguished by an \nunbelievable miracle that occurred to her regularly. From her very birth, signs of wounds \nappeared on her body in the same places where Lord Jesus Christ bore the nails driven \ninto His hands on the cross. These wounds in Theresa Neumann’s hands would become \nred on every Friday, and sometimes even bleed on their own. It was an annual miraculous \nevent on every Good Friday, when her wounds from her hands would drip blood. \nHundreds of thousands of Christians from around the world came to see her every year \nand felt blessed to have been in her presence. The day that Swamiji went to see her was a \nFriday. All of her wounds were bleeding. Swamiji said that Richard Wright was with him \nat the scene; Sister Etta and Dr. Lewis’ son were elsewhere. Wright fainted and fell to the \nground upon seeing Theresa Neumann’s bleeding wounds. After this, Yoganandaji and his \ncompanions traveled to Greece, Asia Minor, Jerusalem and Egypt, and eventually \nboarded an India-bound ship at Port Sayed. It was here that Swamiji was forced to ask Dr. \nLewis’ son to return to the United States because of the young man’s ill health. The three \ntravelers now were booked along with the car for Bombay. It was from this place that \nnews came to Calcutta that Swamiji would be arriving in Bombay very soon and that he \nhad two persons accompanying him; one of them was a man who acted as his personal \nsecretary and the other was a middle-aged woman who was his attendant and who cooked \nhis meals and such things. This writer remembers that when he received this news and \ntook the letter to Swamiji Maharaj Sriyukteshvarji and read it to him, Swamiji Maharaj \nsat up in his easy chair and asked, “Who did you say are coming with him?” When he \nheard that one of the two people accompanying Yoganandaji was his personal secretary \nwho also drove his car and the other was a woman who tended to his cooking and such, \nSriyukteshvarji sighed and sank down in his easy chair in a somewhat disappointed way. \nAfter a short silence, he again sat up and said, “Look, I need to see him on a personal \nlevel. I thought that because Yogananda spent all these years in the West, perhaps he may \nhave acquired a habit of drinking tea. Seeing him after all these years, it’s only right that I \noffer him and his companions some tea.” Saying this, Sriyukteshvarji clapped his hands \nand called a child brahmachari to come. He asked the boy to open the nearby closet and \nbring a sack that Swamiji Maharaj had brought from New Market. Sounding a bit serious, \n69 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 71, "text": " \nSwamiji Maharaj said, “I thought that if I should offer him tea it would be proper to serve \nit in a silver cup and saucer. Now if I serve Yogananda in a silver cup, I must do the same \nfor the other two as well. For this reason, I went to New Market two days ago and \nbrought three sets of silver cups, saucers and spoons. Now I hear that one of them is a \ndriver and the other is a cook!” And then he seemed to become extremely disappointed \nby this and again sank back into his chair. It did not matter how much this writer tried to \nmake him understand that these two people were Yoganandaji’s disciples, that they did \nthese types of jobs as they are necessary. Being an elder and experienced, Gurudev did \nnot want to hear any of this. He just kept on muttering, “One – a driver, and the other – a \ncook!” It was impossible to reason with him at that time with any kind of logic. As it was, \nthe best logic in this case was to just keep quiet. \n \n \nArrival in India \n \n \nYoganandaji and his companions arrived in Bombay and headed for Calcutta by \ntrain. However, he temporarily deviated from his destination, breaking the journey at the \nWardha station and taking his assistants to see Mahatma Gandhi’s ashram in Wardha. \nAmong the many matters discussed in a heartfelt conversation with Mahatmaji, subjects \nsuch as Kriya Yoga and diet were also brought up. Gandhiji was devoted to the practice \nof “ahimsa” [non-violence or non-aggression]; he was vegetarian and did not even eat \neggs. Swamiji suggested that for the sake of health, one could consider eating unfertilized \neggs because there were no sentient lives being taken. Gandhiji listened to Swamiji’s \nwords intently, but he did not make any comment on this matter. Yoganandaji and his \nassistants eventually left Gandhiji’s ashram and took the next Calcutta Mail [name of \ntrain] from the Wardha station and again resumed their journey to Calcutta. \n \n \nMost likely, Swamiji set foot in Bombay on September 16, 1935. Either on that \nvery day or perhaps the next day, the respected English-language newspaper in Calcutta, \nthe Statesman, printed an essay written by Yoganandaji himself. The essay was titled \n“India Replies.” In 1929, an American woman had written a book called “Mother India,” \nin which she had said many derogatory things about India and her culture. This essay was \ncomposed as an answer to the insulting remarks in that book. At that time, Swamiji was \nin his main organizational center at Mount Washington. One day, a gentleman arrived at \nthe ashram with the aforementioned book and handed it to him, saying, “Swamiji, here. \nHere is the picture of your India.” Swamiji was lying down on his belly and resting at the \ntime. There were a few American devotees around him. Right after looking through the \nbook, he began to write. Wright said that he completed the entire essay at one stretch \nfrom that resting place. From a general perspective, the article was quite well written and \nthe erudite language made it a pleasure to read. In certain places a critical finger was \npointed towards the dark sides of American life which were scrutinized sternly. The \npurpose of this essay was to show that no culture was perfect in every aspect. Just as a \ncountry which is spiritually developed may have ordinary folk who are spiritually \nunaware – like India, the same can be true for a land that claims to be superior in the \nempirical sciences – like America – and its ordinary citizens may be equally unaware of \nbasic scientific facts. This should not be a cause for countries to insult each other. Instead, \n70 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

No \ndoubt, the article was written to bring about intelligent discussion. And it was only \nnatural that uncovering and exposing the seamy side of American life would be thought \nof by Indians, especially young people, as an appropriate answer to Miss Mayo’s derisive \nremarks about India’s downtrodden cultural condition. One of the duties this author had \nat that time was to inform Guru Maharaj about the goings on with Yoganandaji after his \narrival. So, on the way to see Sriyukteshvarji to tell him about Swamiji’s arrival in \nBombay, this writer took that newspaper article with him with the intention of showing \nGurudev how his spiritual son was leading the way in inspiring feelings of love for India \nin the hearts of many. A few days before this time, Sriyukteshvarji had become \ndisappointed regarding Yoganandaji’s companions; so this writer thought that perhaps \nthis essay would cheer him up. The writer reached Serampore, went to Sriguru’s house \nand gave him the happy news of his dear disciple setting foot on his motherland. \nSriyukteshvarji was certainly very pleased to hear this although he did not show any \nparticular outward emotion. Then the writer spoke about the Statesman article that had \ngreatly moved the hearts of the youths of Calcutta, and that the article had added to the \natmosphere of high-spiritedness and reverence around Yoganandaji. The writer unfolded \nthe paper and showed the article to the Master. Sriyukteshvarji said, “Why don’t you read \nit to me? Let’s hear what he’s written!” The writer happily began to read. When a section \ncame up about events that frequently took place in the deep night in a certain part of New \nYork City, Swamiji Maharaj said, “Read it to me again, will you – what he’s written.” \nThe writer now began to feel a little trepidatious inside. Upon hearing that section read to \nhim once more, Swamiji Maharaj stared at the writer with a strange and questioning look \nand asked, “You’re saying that Yogananda wrote all this?” Responding with an \naffirmative, the writer defended the article and put forth that Yoganandaji did not write \nanything like the derogatory remarks that Miss Mayo had printed in her book against \nIndia; instead, he had given a very appropriate reply to her insults and did so as civilly as \npossible. Sriyukteshvarji had no time to hear this kind of reasoning. Again, he had only \none thing to say, “You’re saying that Yogananda wrote all this? Shame, shame!” Saying \nthis, he listlessly sank back into his easy chair again. The writer was shocked at \nwitnessing this reaction – absolutely dumbfounded. It would take some time to \ncomprehend such a response regarding the spiritual leader of India’s young people by his \ninfinitely wise and knowledgeable guru himself. Sriyukteshvarji certainly had the right to \nknow how his spiritual son was carrying out the mission for which he was sent overseas, \na mission which the Master took so much care to make possible: the mission of \nspreading, teaching and initiating people into that which was known as India’s greatest \ntreasure – the science of awakening spiritual awareness. Guruji could not imagine that \nYoganandaji would be interested in keeping informed about the sordid activities of \nAmerican culture. After all, Yoganandaji was a messenger of India’s spiritual teachings, \nthe symbol of spiritual life! Having had his efforts to give Swamiji Maharaj good news \nsoundly rejected a second time had the writer kicking himself again and again. \n \n \nWelcome Arrival in Calcutta \n \n \nIt was the 18th of September, 1935, the day the Bombay Mail [train] was \n71 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 73, "text": " \nscheduled to arrive at the Howrah Station. A sizeable crowd had gathered at the platform \n– many devotees, Indians interested in the higher life, people from all walks of life. \nEveryone from the Calcutta Yogoda center, as well as Sailesh Mohan and this writer, \nwere there with garlands and bouquets in hand. If memory is served correctly, the writer \nrecalls that he and Sailesh Mohan came to the station in Bishnu Charan’s family car. \nBishnu Charan went separately to bring the Rolls Royce automobile belonging to the \nMaharaja of Santosh, Sir Manmath Roy Choudhury, because it was previously decided \nthat Swamiji should be taken to his family home in that vehicle. The Bombay Mail came \nto Calcutta through Nagpur, and from Nagpur to Calcutta it ran on the Bengal Nagpur \nRailway [line]. It was sarcastically said by many that the acronym of the Bengal Nagpur \nRailway – “B.N.R.” – stood for “Be Never Regular,” because the trains on this line were \nnotorious for being chronically late. But Swamiji’s train came more or less on time. It \nwas a matter of great luck that the first class car in which Swamiji was riding stopped \nexactly in front of this writer. Swamiji was already standing at the door of the \ncompartment. As soon as he set foot on the platform, the writer hailed “Guru Maharaj Ki \nJai!!” [Glory to Guru, the Great King!!], touched Swamiji’s feet and garlanded him as the \nthrong resounded “Guru Maharaj Ki Jai!!” in answer. Swamiji was surrounded by \neveryone in joyous celebration and taken to the waiting Rolls Royce nearby. Others were \nalso getting ready to board their own means of transportation to journey back to Calcutta-\nproper. Right at this time, Sailesh-da – Sailesh Mohan – whispered, “Look, I know \n‘Bishtu’ [Bishnu Charan] and his people; they will forget us and leave without us. I’ve \nbrought money. Come, let’s hire a taxi and go with Swamiji’s car.” So it was in a taxi that \nSailesh Mohan, the writer and a couple of others followed Swamiji’s car and eventually \narrived at Swamiji’s father’s newly purchased house on Ram Mohan Roy Road. It would \nnot at all be an exaggeration to say that the reception at home – by father, brothers, \nsisters-in-law, nephews, nieces, other relatives and friends – was well beyond even the \nlikes of which could be normally expected when any triumphant child of the family \nreturns home after many years. Elder sister Roma Devi’s welcome was especially \nstunning. She was there to receive her spiritually heroic younger brother with a \nceremonial bouquet of flowers; her eyes were meditatively serene. As soon as she came \nin front of him, she fell at his feet with the bouquet still in her hands. Swamiji, \ncompletely unprepared and shocked by this act, cried out, “Bada-didi [elder sister]!! \nWhat are you doing?!!” But by that time, the elder sister had already accomplished what \nshe set out to do. Swamiji spent the first part of the day in that festive atmosphere, \nreuniting with relatives and friends. And the writer’s full-time duties with him began \nfrom the second half of that day onward. \n \n \nThe next day, meaning the second day after Swamiji’s arrival in Calcutta, the \nwriter went to see him in the morning. As he entered, Swamiji looked at Richard Wright, \nwho was also in the room, and said, “Look, look! Does he look just like Mahadev Desai \nor what?” During the short time that Swamiji was at Mahatma Gandhiji’s sevashram \n[ashram of service] in Wardha, he had become friends with Gandhiji’s sole secretary, the \neminent Mahadev Desai. Perhaps in Swamiji’s eyes something in the writer’s appearance \nand behavior looked similar to Desai’s. However, the writer himself could not find any \nlikeness other than both wearing plain white cotton clothes. It was on that very day that \nSwamiji let everyone know that the writer was his sole Indian secretary, and Richard \n72 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

The writer felt very blessed to have been given \nthis unimaginably fortunate opportunity for service. Whenever and for as long as Swamiji \nstayed in Calcutta during his more than one year in India, the writer was graced to be in \nYoganandaji’s constant company. However, the writer was not with him when he traveled \nthe northern and southern parts of India. \n \n \nAs far as one can remember, it seems that it was on that second day after arrival in \nCalcutta that Swamiji went to Serampore in the car brought from America to have \ndarshan [holy visitation] of Sriguru. The writer did not accompany him there. Thus he \nwas not able to witness the wonderful reunion of guru and disciple. In any case, Gurudev \nwas relieved of his “tea serving concerns” because it turned out that Yoganandaji did not \ndrink tea. A brief description of this reunion can be found in Wright’s account of it in the \nMarch 1937 issue of Inner Culture magazine. \n \n \nReception by the Citizens of Calcutta \n \n \nThe next significant event was a formal public reception held by the citizens of \nCalcutta. As previously mentioned, the credit for putting together the welcoming \ncommittee belonged solely to Bishnu Charan; the writer was there only as his assistant. \nThis reception took place just a few days after Swamiji’s arrival. The exact date does not \ncome to mind. At that time in Calcutta, there were only three proper venues for holding \nthis type of a public event: Town Hall, next to the Calcutta High Court; Albert Hall on \nCollege Street; and Ram Mohan Library Hall – the smallest of the three. Town Hall was \nthe largest, but because it was at the edge of the city there was an issue with travel, which \nwould mean that there would be less of a crowd. Albert Hall was in the center of the city \nwith easy access. The main room of the venue was also of quite a respectable size. The \nplace where the “Coffee House” of College Street stands today, drawing students during \ntheir leisure time, was where Albert Hall once stood. The venue was completely full with \nan audience eager to see and hear Swamiji. Most of the members of the welcome \ncommittee were present along with other distinguished citizens. The Maharaja of \nSantosh, Manmath Roy Choudhury, adorned the presidential seat; next to him on two \nsides were Maharaja Sachindra Nandi and the former mayor, Santosh Kumar Basu. It was \nSantosh Basu who performed the customary recitation of an honorary letter of felicitation \non behalf of the citizens. He then presented the letter as a gift to Swamiji. The president \nof the committee and all of the members present honored Swamiji with similar \ngraciousness. Yoganandaji was the main and final speaker of the occasion. Among the \npeople on stage was elder guru-brother [disciple of same guru] Sri Motilal \nMukhopadhyay. Gurudev Sriyukteshvarji was not there. The writer sat on the stage floor, \nright at Swamiji’s feet by his chair. Before the event commenced, Swamiji slightly \nlaughed and asked the writer, “Should I speak in Bengali or English?! Shouldn’t I show \nthem how well a Bengali boy learned to speak in English?!!” The writer happily \nexpressed his agreement and said that it would be great to hear him give the lecture in \nEnglish. And Swamiji did give his lecture in English. Before beginning, he pushed aside \nthe microphone in front of him and began to address the audience directly.

With this incredibly \nbeautiful talk, we were able to catch a glimpse of the magic by which Swamiji had gained \nthe endless praise and admiration of thousands and thousands of men and women in \nAmerica. He had said that he was thought of as one of the two greatest speakers in \nAmerica at that time. That was certainly evidenced by this lecture. This welcome \nreception and Swamiji’s talk was highly lauded by the newspapers and journals. Praise \nspread throughout the city by word of mouth as well, and Swamiji’s presence caused a \nconsiderable stir in the minds and hearts of the people of Calcutta. \n \n \nVisiting the Ranchi Brahmacharya Vidyalaya \n \n \nNow Yoganandaji began to plan for a visit to the very first establishment he \nfounded, the Ranchi Brahmacharya Vidyalaya. News was sent to Ranchi. Meanwhile, at \nhis father’s house in Calcutta, there seemed to be some sort of competitiveness going on \nbetween his two younger brothers Sananda Lal and Bishnu Charan, both vying for the \ngreatest amount of time and closeness with their illustrious brother. At first, upon seeing \nBishnu Charan’s bodybuilding center, his accomplished young students of physical \nculture, as well as his capacity to build an organized institution, Swamiji was duly \nimpressed. However, when it came to the Ranchi trip, it was Sananda Lal who was \nchosen. Two automobiles were to be taken for the journey, Yoganandaji’s Ford Tourist \nand Sananda Lal’s six-cylinder Buick. Richard Wright was the Ford’s driver and Sananda \nLal himself drove his Buick. Both cars were filled snugly with passengers. The writer and \nSatyanandaji’s younger brother, the late Nalini Mohan Majumdar, rode with Sananda Lal. \nThe cars departed fairly early in the morning with the intention to reach the Vidyalaya in \nRanchi by afternoon. But that goal could not be reached. While traveling on Grand Trunk \nRoad, somewhere near Asansol, the Buick began to have mechanical problems and we \nhad to stop. It took some time before the journey could be resumed. However, the \npassengers experienced no discomfort. Swamiji sat everyone down right in the middle of \na field by the side of the road, and he fed and entertained us all with many wonderful \nstories. In the meantime in Ranchi, Satyanandaji, with his teachers and students, began to \nlook towards the road with expectation as early as noon. The students had beautifully \ndecorated the school and its surroundings with flowers and plants. Some small fireworks \nwere procured for the festivities as well. They were prepared to be set off just as Swamiji \narrived. Several of the distinguished citizens of Ranchi also came to the ashram in the \nafternoon, hoping to give Swamiji a grand welcome. But all had to return to their homes \nwith disappointed hearts. By the time the two cars reached the Vidyalaya it was almost \nmidnight. Tiredness took over many of the waiting students, and they went to sleep on the \nfloor or the ground, wherever they happened to be at the time. Knowing that the ashram-\nresidents may be asleep, the horns of the cars were repeatedly sounded, as a sort of \nsignal, right from the time the ashram property was sighted until the cars entered the \ngrounds. Everyone in the Vidyalaya hurriedly got up, wiped their eyes and got ready to \nwelcome Swamiji. The fireworks were lit and there was a resounding call all around, \nshouting out to everyone that Swamiji had returned “home” to his ashram. Satyanandaji, \nupon seeing his guru-like friend after so many years, understandably lost his composure \nand could not hold back his tears as they embraced each other.

Students and teachers who came in to talk with or listen to Swamiji during his \nstay went to sleep right in that room on the mat on which they sat. The other bed was for \nAnanda-da – Yogiraj’s grandson Ananda Mohan Lahiri – and the writer. In Calcutta, \nSwamiji had said many times that during the night, it was only his body that slept, he was \never awake. Whispering this statement in the writer’s ears, Ananda Mohan – after \nSwamiji had fallen asleep and begun to snore – said very softly, “Swamiji, we are \nawake.” Immediately Swamiji answered back, “I know all that.” We tested him again \nduring that same night, and again he answered back immediately, just like before. \nSwamiji spent the next morning in the joyful meeting and greeting of the residents of the \nashram and many people of distinction that had come to see him. In the afternoon, he \ntook several of us by car to the Bhorenda marketplace near the edge of town. We were \nwalking around and seeing the sights when all of a sudden Yoganandaji noticed an \naborigine farmer sitting with a basket full of mushrooms for sale. Swamiji gleefully cried \nout, “Look! God gives me whatever I wish for. Come, let’s take the whole lot!” When the \nparty returned to the ashram, it was the writer who was given the responsibility for \ncooking those mushrooms, and at dinner, as Swamiji ate the dish prepared, he \ncomplimented, “It has been a delicacy.”* \n \n[*Translator’s note: The quoted statement is in English in the original.] \n \n \nOn the third day at the ashram, Swamiji held and conducted a Yogoda class. The \npurpose of this class was to inform many people at once about the matters of Kriya Yoga. \nIt was in this manner that Kriya Yoga was spread in the West. Those who were not \ninterested in Kriya Yoga did not attend this class. Among the people who came on the \njourney from Calcutta, Tulsi-da and Prakash-da – Tulsi Narayan Basu and Prakash \nChandra Basu, respectively – did not attend this class, just as they would not when the \nclass would be held in Calcutta, and stayed outside on the veranda. Noteworthy among \nthose present was the eminent geologist, the elderly Pramath Nath Basu, one of Ranchi’s \nmost respected citizens, and the eminent scientist who located the prime spot for the Tata \nfirm’s ironworks factory. This event was memorable by the demonstration of fixing a \nstudent’s hand on a wall, so that the person could not pull it off, by pure mental power. \nThe boy was a resident-student of the Vidyalaya, about seventeen or eighteen years of \nage, and as he had no parents, his sole guardian was his maternal uncle who raised him in \nthe city of Memio in Burma. He was enrolled in the Ranchi Vidyalaya because it \nprovided solid education in a righteous environment. After his talk, Swamiji called this \nboy and announced that he would now show everyone a demonstration of how powerful \nthe mind actually is. Swamiji said that he would fix this boy’s hand on a wall. The boy \nwas taken to a nearby wall and told to hold his arm horizontally on the wall with his palm \nflat against it. Then Swamiji sort of massaged that arm with his own hands, from the \nboy’s armpit to the palm, and said, “Now the hand is stuck!” Swamiji tried to move the \nhand and showed that it could not move. The boy also could not move it himself. The \nreaders may remember that, in his childhood, it was in this very same way that Swamiji \nstuck his household cook’s hand to the wall. Until Swamiji himself came and touched the \nhand and said, “Now the hand is free!” the boy could not free himself, just as the incident \nwith the cook. The writer, who also had been in Burma during childhood, had a \n75 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 77, "text": " \nconversation with the boy. Probably feeling some affinity with the writer, the boy spoke \nopenly when asked about his experience. He said that he became terribly afraid just \nseeing Swamiji, as if his life was flying out of him – a strange feeling would come over \nhim. Whenever Swamiji came to the Ranchi ashram after this incident, the boy would do \nwhatever he could to avoid Yogananda. He would run away and sit on a distant field. \nAfter spending several days in his old, memory-filled, “first-creation,” Swamiji and party \nboarded their two cars and headed in the direction of Calcutta. On the way, around \nmidday, they stopped to pay respects to a very advanced yogi at his house in Burdwan. \n \n \nThis great yogi was Sri Sri Kumar Nath Mukhopadhyay, known to Bengali \nreaders by his pen-name of “Sudhakar.” This sage was famous for his collection of \nwritings, which consisted of unique translations of the great Sanskrit scriptures – such as \nthe Gita, Chandi etc. – in the Bengali poetic meter known as “payar cchanda.” It is most \nlikely that the only rendition of the verses of the Gita in Bengali payar cchanda is his. As \na writer, he was known as “Sudhakar” and the collection of his writings was called \n“Sudhakar Granthavali” [collection of books by Sudhakar]. In his youth, he became \nextremely attracted to the path of Lahiri Baba’s Kriya Yoga after reading and hearing \nabout it from Acharya Panchanon Bhattacharya’s writings and lectures. Kumar Nath \nwrote to Kashi Baba Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares, asking to be initiated into the \npractice of Kriya Yoga as established by Him. In response, the Yogiraj wrote back telling \nhim to go and see Acharya Panchanon Bhattacharya in Calcutta. Thus one morning, \nKumar Nath took a train to Calcutta. After arriving there, he began to walk in the \ndirection of Bhattacharya Mahasaya’s home in Ahiritola. He had to pass through a \nneighborhood of ill-repute known as “Sonagacchi.” As he was going through that area, \nKumar Nath’s sight fell on the girls standing out in the verandas of the upper floors of the \nhouses. However, he had no lustful intentions in his heart. Suddenly, he saw Bhattacharya \nMahasaya pass by him, with upper body bare, draped with a towel for bathing; he was \nrubbing oil on himself as he walked towards the Ganges to take a bath. Kumar Nath \nthought that Bhattacharya Mahasaya must have seen him looking at the girls, and he \nshrunk in shame. Feeling a bit low, he went to Bhattacharya Mahasaya’s house anyway \nand waited on the front porch for him to return from the Ganges. But he waited for good \nlong while and there was no sign of Bhattacharya Mahasaya. It was getting close to noon. \nThen someone from within the house opened the door and saw Kumar Nath standing \nthere. The man asked him why he was waiting there. He said that he was waiting to see \nBhattacharya Mahasaya; he had seen the acharya going to take a bath in the Ganges, but \nwhere was he? It had been quite a long time! The man from the house said, “No sir! He \nhasn’t gone anywhere! He’s in the house!” Saying so, the man went into the house for a \nshort while, came back and invited Kumar Nath inside. Acharya Mahasaya was sitting in \nthe front room itself. Kumar Nath touched his feet and said, “I saw you going to bathe in \nthe Ganges, but why did I not see you come back?” Acharya-dev answered, “No, I’ve \nbeen sitting here in this same place since morning. I haven’t gone anywhere! Oh! You say \nyou saw me? Well, I suppose people see a lot of things.” Kumar Nath was astonished. \nWhat a way to begin the practice of Kriya Yoga! After staying at Kumar Nath’s residence \nfor a few hours – taking pictures of him and his wife, separately and together, as well as \npictures of Swamiji and Kumar Nath together – in profound bliss and spiritual \nintoxication, the party took leave of the great yogi and resumed the journey back to \n76 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

This meeting was the beginning of a collection of material that would later be \nwritten in book form by Swamiji – in his “Autobiography of a Yogi” – about the great \nsages of India. \n \n \nObtaining Control of the Property Rights in Ranchi \n \n \nWhile he was in Ranchi, Swamiji came to know that the estate of the Maharaja of \nKashim Bazar was in terrible financial trouble and that Maharaja Srishachandra Nandi \nwas trying to sell all of the property and assets of the Vidyalaya – the ashram, garden, \nresidential quarters and all – for the sake of financial solvency. So, immediately upon \nreturning to Calcutta, Swamiji had his youngest brother Bishnu Charan set up a meeting \nwith Maharaja Srishachandra. He did not speak about this to anyone but Bishnu Charan. \nThey met on the specified day, and after the customary greetings and precursory small \ntalk, Swamiji brought up the subject of the Vidyalaya and wanted to know if the \nMaharaja really wanted to sell that property in Ranchi. The Maharaja explained the \nfinancial condition of the estate and confirmed that he was eager to sell all of his Ranchi \nproperties. Hearing this, Swamiji responded firmly, “You cannot destroy the glory of \nKashim Bazar! So – if you do not take offense at this, and you do not feel that I am being \nsly in some way – I propose that you turn over the property of the Vidyalaya to me. As far \nas the financial problems associated with the property on which the Vidyalaya is \noperated, I will pay its selling price, no questions asked.” The property was in the name \nof the Queen Mother of Kashim Bazar and its price was 30,000 rupees. The Maharaja \nagreed to the proposition. As part of the exchange, the “Madhuban” palace, which was \nbeing used as the branch that handled the primary grades, was returned to the Maharaja. \nIt came to be known that this transaction was possible through the help of Mr. Lynn in \nAmerica. Later, on the 1st of January in 1937 at the Mount Washington center, Swamiji \nhimself announced that this purchase could be made because of donations by Mr. Lynn \nand the American devotees. After the ashram-school with its expansive land and gardens \nwas purchased under the name of Yogoda Satsanga, Swamiji made the Ranchi ashram the \nheadquarters of Yogoda Satsanga in India. The teachers of the Vidyalaya who were \nmembers of the Brahmacharya Sangha left the ashram on friendly terms, and started the \nBrahmacharya Vidyalaya anew on Bijoy-da’s property in an area known as “Nivaranpur” \non the outskirts of Ranchi. However, all of the residential students of the original ashram \nremained with Yogoda, and the school on the Yogoda property was now renamed \n“Yogoda Satsanga Brahmacharya Vidyalaya.” \n \n \nAnnual Festival at the Calcutta Center \n \n \nBesides taking care of the property issues concerning Ranchi, the other matter of \nsignificance in Calcutta for Yoganandaji was the yearly festival at the Calcutta Yogoda \ncenter – the public gathering for the Autmnal Equinox and the feast after it with friends, \ndevotees and followers. The celebration was coordinated by the ever-active duo, co-\norganizers Saliesh Mohan Majumdar and Sailendra Bejoy Dasgupta. Attendance was \nhuge that year because of Yoganandaji’s presence at the celebration. Albert Hall was \n77 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

The main attraction \nwas Swami Yogananda’s discourse. On this day Swamiji’s lecture was in Bengali. This \ntalk was also captivating, just as the previous one in English. It was not possible to \nsurmise that it was his first Bengali lecture to a public audience of this size. Towards the \nend of the speech, in order to demonstrate the power of mind over the body, he asked the \naudience members to stand up and clasp their own palms tightly together. Swamiji \ninstructed everyone to intensely think that the hands were now inseparably stuck together \nand could not be separated. He counted out loud, “one, two, three…” up to six, and then \nexclaimed that the hands were now joined and could not be separated. It was observed \nthat almost two hundred of the audience members could not pull their hands apart. Then \nYoganandaji pulled his own palms apart, saying, “Here! Now they’re free!” Almost \neveryone who had their palms fixed to each other were able to free their hands after \nseeing him do it, except for seven poor souls whose palms were helplessly stuck together. \nYoganandaji called them to the stage and he himself helped six of them unclasp their \nhands. But the seventh one’s palms just would not open. When this person approached \nthe stage, Moti Babu – Motilal Mukhopadhyay – suddenly began to stir restlessly in his \nchair. This fellow was Moti Babu’s disciple, a doctor by profession, known to be miserly, \nand – as it was found out later – was basically a bundle of nerves.* It turned out that in \nfront of sages and saints this man simply became paralyzed from nervousness. No matter \nhow much Swamiji tried to unclasp the man’s palms, the more it seemed that the entire \nstructure of his upper appendages became more stiff and twisted. Finally, Moti Babu \nstood up and said to Swamiji, “You won’t be able to help him. I’ll take him.” Saying this, \nMoti Babu took the man outside the hall. The writer was sitting on a low platform right \nnext to Swamiji’s feet and was watching everything. When Moti Babu ushered the man \noutside, the writer followed them. Moti Babu gently caressed the man’s back and said, \n“There now my child. Everything’s all right now. It’s all right.” After about four or five \nminutes of this, the gentleman finally regained a sense of normalcy and his hands were \neventually fine. The writer had also tried to get his palms to become stuck together \nexactly according to Swamiji’s instructions, but nothing happened. Upon returning to \nSwamiji’s residence after the meeting, the writer asked him, “Swamiji, I was sitting \nclosest to you. Why is it that nothing happened to me?!” Swamiji laughed lightheartedly, \nlooked slyly at the writer and said, “It won’t happen to you. You’re a critic.**” A few \ndays after the festival, when the writer went to see Guru Maharaj Sriyukteshvarji in \nSerampore, the very first thing that Maharaj ji said was, “What is this that Yogananda \nshowed? There is nothing spiritual at all in this. These are nothing but tricks.***” \n \n[*Translator’s note: The phrase “a bundle of nerves” is in English in the original.] \n \n[** and ***Translator’s note: The words “critic” and “tricks” are written in English in the \noriginal.] \n \n \nSwamiji now came to the weekly meetings of the Calcutta Yogoda Satsanga held \nevery Saturday and because of his presence, the gatherings were full of life and profound \n78 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Before the commencement of each service, Swamiji would say that only \nif there were five or six new attendees would he allow himself to partake of prasad \n[sacramental food]. The writer knew the count would always be definitely more than that, \nbecause every time Swamiji came across anyone he knew, he invited them to the satsang \n[spiritual meeting], which meant that dinner would also be served for these guests at the \nashram. The writer used to prepare for twenty-five or thirty guests, but not only did the \nnumbers exceed this estimate regularly, sometimes more than fifty or sixty people came. \nIf it got to be too late in the evening, the residents of the ashram had to send for food \nfrom a restaurant, sometimes a good distance away if nearby places were closed. \nWhenever Swamiji would see someone he knew, he would say, “Come to our center. It’s \na beehive of spirituality. You’ll find great joy there.” And it was absolutely true; as long \nas he was present, at least once a week that small center became transformed with the \natmosphere of a spiritual beehive. \n \n \nYogoda Class \n \n \nAt this time, a sort of outdoor lecture hall was created in the garden area on the \nnorth side of Swamiji’s father’s house on Ram Mohan Roy Road. A canopy was hung and \nfabric was draped on all four sides to form quite an acceptable space for gatherings on the \nlawn. A platform serving as a stage was set up on the east side of this space, and a chair \nwas situated in the center of the platform. There were benches and chairs placed on the \nground in front, facing the stage. It was in this space that Swamiji held his American-\nstyle sessions of giving Kriya Yoga initiation to many people at one time. Only those who \nwere already initiated into the practice of Kriya Yoga or who were going to be initiated \nwere allowed in the sessions. It comes to mind that, during the first such gathering, \nSwamiji’s childhood friend Tulsi Narayan Basu and Swamiji’s follower Prakash Das took \ncare to remain outside. Swamiji sat on the chair on the stage and those who were being \ninitiated sat on the chairs or benches facing the stage. After speaking about all of the \npreliminary and necessary aspects, Swamiji asked the writer to come on stage and \ndemonstrate the techniques of Mahamudra and Kriya Pranayam to the aspirants. Far from \ntelling the writer that this was about to happen, Swamiji did not even give the writer any \nsort of hint that he would have to show these things in front of people. It must be \nunderstood that in traditional practice, Kriya Yoga initiation is given in secret. In any \ncase, Swamiji was happy to see that his instructions were carried out. Then he himself \nconducted the final and absolutely important part of the initiation, “Jyoti Darshan” \n[seeing inner Light], showing the technique personally and individually to everyone. \nBefore concluding the session, Swamiji said that the new initiates should regularly visit \nthe Calcutta Yogoda Satsanga center where they could learn everything about the path \nand spirituality. He said that the center was an “Inner Circle.”* Later, the writer asked \nYoganandaji, “Swamiji, initiation is a secret affair between guru and disciple, and it is \nalso an event that begins a deeply connected relationship between them. Can a mass \ninitiation produce the same result?” Swamiji looked at the writer from the corners of his \neyes and said, “Look, I want to throw the net far and wide, so that at least a couple of big \nfishes can be caught.” The next time the writer met Gurudev Sriyukteshvarji, he \ndescribed the event of this mass Kriya initiation to the Master.

Captain Rashid, \nformer director of operations for Yoganandaji’s work in America, as well as former \nassistant and lifelong friend, was now an aide-de-camp* of the young king of Mysore \n[now a province], and he was also the king’s dear friend. He knew that Swamiji was in \nIndia. The festival of Diwali was a royal affair in the kingdom of Mysore and celebrated \nwith regal pomp and flair every year. Through Rashid’s suggestion, Swamiji was invited \nto be a guest of the kingdom at this event. And an incredible event concerning a lame \nperson took place while he was there as a royal guest. There were some enthusiasts in \nBangalore who were aware of Swamiji’s supernatural abilities. Many in the city were \ninterested in having Swamiji give a spiritual talk, and a public lecture was arranged to be \nheld in a large hall. Several persons asked Swamiji to demonstrate something \nsupernatural. One of these people found a lame man and brought him to Swamiji. This \nman had to walk on one leg and on crutches, as the other leg was permanently crippled in \na bent position. Swamiji looked directly into the man’s eyes and said, “Do you believe I \ncan heal you?” The man answered that he had complete faith that Swamiji could heal him \nof his lameness. Swamiji later said that the man’s eyes showed that he did have complete \nfaith. Swamiji then told his companion to bring the man to the public meeting on the \nfollowing day. The next day, the lecture hall was full, and no announcement had been \nmade regarding the lame man. After Swamiji took the stage, the crippled man arrived \nwith his companion and made his way to the platform. Swamiji indicated that he wanted \nto have the man brought up on the stage itself. When the man came on stage, Swamiji \nwent very close to him, looked at him directly into his eyes and again asked, “Do you \nhave complete faith that I can heal your leg?” Swamiji later said that, from all indications \nin his outward appearance and his behavior, the man seemed to have complete faith in \nhim. Swamiji kept looking at the crippled man and then suddenly kicked away one of his \ncrutches. The man was shocked and about to fall, when Swamiji commanded with \ntremendous power in his voice, “Stand up!!”** The man looked at Swamiji’s eyes and, \nlike a machine, stood straight up on both legs. Then Swamiji commanded again with that \nsame firmness and power, “Walk!!” And, like a machine turned on, the man walked off \nthe stage down to the main floor of the hall. The entire audience was stunned. The walls \nshook with roaring and endless applause. The following day, the Bangalore Observer and \nanother daily newspaper ran front-page, full-page stories with bold headings, resplendent \nwith commentaries praising this miraculous event. \n \n[*Translator’s note: The term “aide-de-camp” is in French [Roman alphabet] in the \noriginal.] \n \n81 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Among these destinations was the ashram of Sri Ramana \nMaharshi in Tiruvannamalai. This holy place, a pilgrimage site for the spiritually thirsty, \nhad quite an influence on Swamiji. He was particularly affected by Yogi Ramiah, an \nadept sadhak-disciple of the Maharshi. When the two of them met, at one appropriate \nmoment they both looked into each other’s eyes and became still for quite a while. \nSwamiji later said, “During that silent exchange as we looked into each other’s eyes, I \nwas almost touching the ‘Eternal-Boundless.’”* Richard Wright, acutely perceptive and \nquick, captured this scene forever in his camera. After coming back to Calcutta, Swamiji \nquietly told this writer, “It seems like that disciple is even more advanced than his guru!” \nThere was one particular thing of note regarding his travels in South India. Swamiji did \nnot go to Pondicherry and did not express any particular interest in wanting to see Sri \nAurobindo [sage in Pondicherry]. \n \n[*Translator’s note: The term “ananta-aseem” or “Eternal-Boundless” is in quotation \nmarks within the quoted statement in the original.] \n \n \nOrganizational Attempts in Calcutta \n \n \nImmediately after Swamiji returned to Calcutta, Bishnu Charan made every effort \nto establish himself as Swamiji’s closest person, and at the same time tried to help \nhimself with Swamiji’s widespread and immense influence. Swamiji was also quite taken \nby Bishnu Charan’s accomplished students of physical culture at his health and fitness \ncenter. He began to think that these physically fit youths and their leader Bishnu Charan \nwould be able to bring new life into the work of Yogoda Satsanga in India. Naturally, the \nenthusiastic workers of the past gradually fell to the rear of Swamiji’s attention and focus. \nAn institution needs finances to move forward; there was no shortage of wealthy people \nin the country; what was needed was only a way to attract them. Bishnu Charan had a \nmillionaire supporter – Sheth* Yugal Kishor Birla of the Birla lineage. Shethji was very \nmuch a miser, but when he saw physically fit youths, it pleased him and he helped them. \nBishnu Charan used to put on exhibitions of physical fitness, demonstrated by his many \nstudents, and receive financial prizes from the Sheth. Birlaji also was very happy about \nBishnu Charan’s methods of work and aspirations. Seeing that Bishnu Charan had made \nthe discipline of high-level physical culture available for Bengali Hindu youths brought \ngreat joy to the Sheth. It was through his help that Bishnu Charan was able to found large \ncenters of physical culture at the Jadavpur College, Benares Hindu University and the \nKangri Guru-Kula Ashram in Hardwar. The salaries for teachers and assistant instructors \n– graduates of Bishnu Charan’s school – were also provided by Shethji. There was an \nastounding feat that Yoganandaji was able to do – stop his heart from beating. And he \ncould also demonstrate this tremendously advanced yogic ability in front of people, and \n82 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

He had performed this feat \npublicly in quite a few places in India as well, like the time when he demonstrated it in \nfront of a number of political and royal dignitaries at the Nikhil Bharat Kshatriya \nconference. Bishnu Charan wanted Swamiji to stop his heart at a gathering of millionaire \nsheth Marwaris [people of Marwar] and thus clear the way for financial donations. At \nBishnu Charan’s insistent effort, Sheth Yugal Kishor Birla and quite a few other wealthy \nsheths came together at the Birla Bhavan, wanting to see Swamiji demonstrate this \nextraordinary and inhuman ability. Bishnu Charan and Swamiji came to the event at the \nappointed time. But nothing was heard about it afterwards. Later, Bishnu Charan \ndisappointedly said in a quiet tone of voice, “Mejda [Yoganandaji] ruined everything. He \nwasn’t able to stop his heart from beating.” However, nothing about this was ever brought \nout. During this time, the writer went one day to see Guru Maharaj in Serampore. \nAlthough that particular event was never mentioned anywhere, it was known that Bishtu-\nda [Bishnu Charan] had organized events for Swamiji in many places, particularly in \nwealthy Marwari circles. After listening to everything, Gurudev remained quiet for a \nwhile and then commented, “He (Yoganandaji) has a disease – where a ghoul comes and \nsits on his back. First there was Basu-ghoul, and now Bishtu [Bishnu]-ghoul is sitting on \nhis back.” Hearing this statement, the writer was completely dumfounded – speechless. \n \n[*Translator’s note: “Sheth” – a type of title for a North Indian merchant.] \n \n \nAt one point during this time, Swamiji went to visit Gorakhpur to meet with old \nrelatives and friends. One day, caught up in enacting a childhood memory, he bit into a \nsugar-cane and accidentally cracked a tooth from the lower mandible. Everyone became \nflustered by this and Swamiji was eventually taken to the finest dentist in the city, who \npulled the broken tooth out and replaced it with a gold one. No news was sent to Calcutta \nabout this. After Swamiji returned to Calcutta, the gold tooth caught the writer’s eye, and \nwhen he asked about it, Swamiji put his right index finger on his lips and said, “No \nnegative talk!”* Later, he described the above-mentioned event in detail. Then he fell into \na pensive mood and said, “God told me, ‘Just like this, one day I’ll snatch your life from \nyou.’” As Swamiji was saying this he clenched his fist and created an intense expression \non his face, and showed how his life was going to be snatched away. Who could have \nknown at that time that he would make his journey into death almost exactly as he said! \nThat account will come later. \n \n[*Translator’s note: The quoted statement is in English in the original.] \n \n \nAfter Swamiji returned to Calcutta, the writer went with him many times to \nSerampore to be with Sriguru. There was a time when Swami Satyanandaji and Sailesh-\nda – Sailesh Mohan – were also with us. One day on the second floor, Sriyukteshvarji \nwas speaking with Yoganandaji; Swami Satyananda was next to him. Standing behind \nwere Sailesh-da and the writer. At one point, Gurudev spoke about the writer, “I love that \nboy so much. He’s a very reasonable* boy.” When the writer heard this, there was no end \nto his joy. He silently said to himself, “Then my outwardly stern Gurudev held a loving \nplace in his heart for this wretched person after all!” Overcome with gratitude for his \nincredible good fortune, the writer was in ecstasy.

Ananda-da and \nthe writer were downstairs. Before going upstairs, Yoganandaji went to a drainage spot, a \nbit apart from the area, and began to urinate into the drainage passage. This caught \nGurudev’s attention and he cryptically joked, “Yogananda has become a ‘paramhansa’ \n[great swan, or great soul]!” After urinating, Yoganandaji saw Ananda-da standing at the \nfront door and quietly said, “Ananda-da! Did you hear? Swamiji [Sriyukteshvarji] called \nme a ‘paramhansa!’” Later, Ananda-da laughed and said to the writer, “You’ll see. \nYogananda will one day use this title!” \n \n[*Translator’s note: The word “reasonable” is in English in the original.] \n \n \n \n \nSri Sailesh Mohan Majumdar  \n(Swami Shuddhananda Giriji Maharaj) \n \n \nAttempt at Uniting Sadhu Sabha and Yogoda Satsanga Society \n \n \nThe days were passing by.

Once these things were legally settled, \nhe could prepare for his final journey. Among the assets were the beautiful and immense \ntwo-storey mansion with surrounding property in Serampore and quite a good amount of \nabadi [functional]* land in a village in the Hoogly district. The Puri ashram and the \npreviously mentioned finances were already designated for the Sadhu Sabha.** \nSriyukteshvarji wished for the Puri ashram to be used for the research and practice of \nastronomy and astrology, and the finances were to be used to fund that endeavor. He had \nalready begun to set up a kind of observatory on the ashram premises modeled somewhat \nafter the “yantar mantar” types of structures in Jaipur, Delhi and Benares. A nephew of \nhis named Manu lived with Maharaj ji at his Serampore house. This man had no means of \nincome, nor did he do any kind of job. It has been heard that Gurudev wished to leave all \nof the village land to Manu, and the rest, including Priyadham – his Serampore home, the \nPuri ashram and the aforementioned savings, to the institution directed by Yoganandaji. \nGuru and his dear disciple discussed all of this and decided to form a legal deed which \nwould connect all of the organizational branches of India and America under one \ninstitution. The responsibility of preparing the paperwork was given to an established \nattorney by the name of Roy Choudhury from the High Court area. The central \norganization was to be named “Yogoda Satsanga Society of India and America,” with \nSriyukteshvar Giri as its founder and Swami Yogananda as its president. On the day the \ndeed was to be witnessed and signed, everyone went to the attorney’s office. Guru \nMaharaj Sriyukteshvarji was driven there by Sananda Lal. Satyanandaji and several \nothers were also present. The agreement stated that Sadhu Sabha and all of the branches \nof Yogoda Satsanga, including all of the property and funds of both organizations, would \nbe merged as one under a new name. At the time of signing, this came out of \nYoganandaji’s mouth: “I was really the one who did everything…” – meaning the title of \nfounder, particularly because of America, where the entire institution was founded by \nhim. Sriyukteshvarji Maharaj was shocked; he looked at Yoganandaji’s face for a second, \ntook his walking stick and marched out of the attorney’s office directly to Sananda Lal’s \ncar, and went back. Everyone was absolutely dumbstruck by this sudden and completely \nunexpected and unimaginable event. Thus Sriyukteshvarji’s heart’s desire – leaving all \nthat belonged to him to his worthy disciple – was never carried out. Sriyukteshvarji was \nso wounded by Yoganandaji’s behavior at that time that, on that very day, Gurudev gave \nup all hope of a future for his institution. When the writer met Sananda Lal for the last \ntime in 1978, this event was brought up. Sananda Lal said at that time, “Swamiji Maharaj \n[Sriyukteshvarji] was so angry while we were riding in the car that he said, ‘That is not \nself-will; that is unlawful conduct.’” \n \n[*Translator’s note: The word “abadi” can mean land ready to be used, farmland, or \nresidential land.] \n \n[**Translator’s note: “Sadhu Sabha” – spiritual society founded by Swami Sriyukteshvar \nGiri.] \n \n \nGoing to the Kumbha Mela \n \n85 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 87, "text": " \n  \nThis regrettable state of affairs naturally caused Yoganandaji to become tormented \nand full of sorrow. However, he himself was responsible for matters turning out this way. \nNo one except those who were present at the attorney’s office knew what had happened. \nSome signs of somberness surely colored his usually cheerful behavior full of life, but \nthose who were not abreast of the things that went on in the private areas of his life could \nnot catch this change in him. Gurudev Swamiji Maharaj had returned to his normal \nmanner of being. There was no indication of there being any difference in the loving \nbehavior he had always demonstrated towards his dear disciple. Yogananda went to see \nSriguru several times after the incident mentioned in the previous section; there was no \nchange in the affection and friendliness with which Gurudev had treated Swamiji before. \nOne day, Yoganandaji told Gurudev that he had a great desire to go to the Kumbha Mela \n[massive gathering of sages] in Prayag, Allahabad. Gurudev sarcastically responded, \n“What’ll you see at the Kumbha Mela? Nothing but hundreds of naga sannyasis [nude \nsages], ringing their bells while they parade themselves up and down.” As Sriguru \nmentioned the naga sannyasis, he raised his arms and waved his hands, like someone \nwaving from a parade to the crowd. And then Gurudev broke into a huge belly laugh. \nYogananda was a bit thrown by Sriyukteshvarji’s enactment, but he replied, “But the \nKumbha Mela was where you met Babaji Maharaj [Lahiri Mahasaya’s immortal Guru]!” \nGurudev did not respond further. Perhaps he thought that his parodying act would make \nYogananda abandon his ideas about going to that immense conference of religious \npeople. But after returning to Calcutta, Yogananda took some relatives and went to the \nKumbha Mela in Allahabad anyway. When word of this got to Sriyukteshvarji, Gurudev \ncould not even believe it at first. With an expression of great disappointment and sadness, \nhe asked the news bearer, “What did you say? Yogananda left?” Sriguru fell into a state \nof resignation after hearing the news. During the morning, he had come to know that his \ndays in this world were coming to an end, although he did not outwardly tell anyone. All \nof his efforts to complete things and all of his seeming anxiety about matters at hand were \nconnected to his being aware of this fact. Now, his duties for this part of his journey were \nfinished; it was time for the Return. Without telling anyone, he began to prepare for his \nfinal journey. Previously, every year at this particular time, Guru Maharaj used to leave \nSerampore and hold gatherings at different village centers of Yogoda Satsanga in \nMidnapore [Medinipur]. He met with disciples there, initiated new aspirants into the path \nof Kriya Yoga and then went for the annual festival held at the Puri ashram at that time of \nyear. Usually, the date of this celebration was designated to be immediately after the Holi \nfestival [festival attributed to Krishna, where people color each other with vermillion], \nand those attending were invited to come to the Puri ashram with the remnants of Holi \nstill on them. But this year, Gurudev asked everyone by letter to gather at the Puri ashram \nbefore Holi. Before leaving Serampore, he met with those who were closest to him in that \ntown. Near his house was the home of a distinguished brahmin barrister. Sriyukteshvarji \nwas close to most everyone in that family. The present guardian of that house is now \nquite advanced in years. He remembers Sriyukteshvarji very well. In 1975, he told the \nwriter, “That year [1936], Swamiji Maharaj came to our house and asked us to call my \nmother-in-law. When mother came out on the second floor veranda and looked at him, \ncovering her head with part of her sari [sign of showing respect], Swamiji Maharaj said to \nher, ‘Bouthan [respected sister], I’m going! All is well, no?’ Everyone thought that he \nwas leaving for the Puri ashram for the annual festival, like the years before. But we all \n86 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

It felt like he had come to see all of his children for one last time.” Guru \nMaharaj arrived at the Puri ashram quite a few days before the Holi festival. \n \n \nMeanwhile, Swami Yogananda, with several of his relatives and friends, had \nmade his way to the Kumbha Mela – the oldest, most prominent and largest gathering of \nsaints and sages in India. Swamiji collected many anecdotes for his future autobiography \nhere, but the singular thing for which he longed so deeply and intensely – the darshan \n[holy sighting] of Babaji Maharaj – was not fulfilled. From the lecture that Yoganandaji \ngave in front of hundreds of people on January 1, 1937, it was learned that Paramhansa \nKeshabananda indicated to him that if he went to Badrinarayan, there was a possibility of \nhaving darshan of Babaji Maharaj. Swamiji returned to Calcutta from the Kumbha Mela \nvisit about one or two days before Holi. Upon returning, he came to know that Gurudev \nwas in Puri and had asked him to go there. But brothers, sisters, relatives and close \nfriends did not want to let him go when, after so many years, they again had a chance to \ncelebrate the joyous festival of Holi with him. And Yoganandaji also could not deny \nthem. \n \n \nGurudev’s Final Journey \n \n \nDuring the day of the Holi festival, everyone was caught up in joyful celebration, \ncoloring each other with vermillion and water-paint; the day was filled with fun and \nlaughter. In the evening, a telegram arrived from Puri, saying that Gurudev was extremely \nill and that there was very little chance of his remaining alive. Yoganandaji immediately \nprepared to go to Puri. Apparently Gurudev had himself written, by his own hand, on the \ntelegram form, “Never so sick before.”* It was too late to catch a train for Puri that day; \nso it was decided that the Puri Express would be taken the very next morning. However, \nthe train was fully booked and no reservations could be made for traveling to Puri on that \nday. Thus it was on the third day that Swamiji took Richard Wright and Sudhir-da – \nSudhir Roy – and made for Puri on the Puri Express. But because of this lengthy delay, \nYoganandaji was not able to see Sriyukteshvarji alive. When he arrived at the Puri \nashram, he saw the elder and close disciples of the past sitting around Sriyukteshvarji’s \nmortal frame and waiting anxiously for Yoganandaji to arrive. All of the elders were \nthere: Roy Bahadur Atul Roy Choudhury, Amulya Santra and Amulya Das and others \nfrom Kidderpore, as well as the elder disciples from the various village centers in \nMidnapore, and more. Everyone was present during Gurudev’s last moments except the \none who was his representative to the world. Yoganandaji performed the last rites, and, as \nrealized beings are traditionally put under the earth or entombed, and not cremated, \nGurudev’s body was buried on the premises of the Puri ashram. Guru Maharaj left for his \nGreat Journey on March 9, 1936. Under Yoganandaji’s direction, a bhandara celebration \n[honorary celebration] for this occasion was held, attended by innumerable disciples and \ndevotees from many different places. Yoganandaji initiated Sudhir-da into the path of \nsannyas, giving him the name of “Swami Sevananda Giri,” and turned over the \nmanagement of the Puri ashram to him. \n87 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Swami Yogananda was \nthe deputy-president of Sadhu Sabha; after Gurudev Sriyukteshvarji’s departure, the full \nresponsibility of that sabha [congregation] fell on Swamiji’s shoulders. He re-established \nSadhu Sabha with himself as president, Swami Satyananda as deputy-president and the \nlate Prabhas Chandra Ghosh as director, and set the association on a new course. Because \nthe order now had a new president, it became necessary to make a legal adjustment \nregarding the ownership of its assets – such as the Puri ashram and the money designated \nfor the Sadhu Sabha. The Serampore home and the Puri ashram were inherited family-\nproperties. Because Sriyukteshvarji did not have a living offspring, difficulties arose in \nmaking decisions about those properties, as those houses and the previously mentioned \nfunctional land in a village in the Hoogly District were not left to anyone in a written \nwill. The houses – where for almost half-a-century Sriyukteshvarji initiated aspirants into \nKriya Yoga, taught the very essence of spiritual wisdom in many other ways, and kept the \nplaces ever-open as second homes for hundreds and thousands of disciples and devotees – \nwere of deep emotional value to his followers for their spiritual atmosphere and \nmemories attached to them. It was because he had foreseen all of these issues that \nSriyukteshvarji wanted to merge and re-establish both institutions [Sadhu Sabha and \nYogoda Satsanga], legally registered, under one new name. Yoganandaji must now have \nbeen regretting his past indiscretion. Swami Satyananda became the acting president of \nSadhu Sabha after Yoganandaji went back to America because the signature of an officer \nof an organization was not legally recognized in India if that officer was residing in, and a \ncitizen of, another country. \n \n \nSwamiji’s Last Chapters in India \n \n \nThe ever-cheerful Yoganandaji’s vivaciousness seemed to subside a bit after \nGurudev’s passing. After having come back to India for Sriguru and having been in his \nphysical presence once again, he had not been able to carry out three of Maharaj ji’s last \nwishes, whatever the reasons may be. Gurudev’s wishes were: first – uniting Sadhu \nSabha and Yogoda Satsanga as a newly registered institution under a new name, and \nthereby turning over all of his work legally into the hands of his deserving disciple; \nsecond – wanting his dear disciple to stay with him during his last days on Earth instead \nof going to the Kumbha Mela (perhaps there were some instructions and wisdom that \nGurudev wanted to pass on); and third – for guru and beloved disciple to see each other \none last time before the end. \n \n \nYogananda’s pain was only natural and expected, although he did not show any \noutward signs of it other than being much more introverted than usual. The vision that he \nhad had of working with Bishnu Charan gradually faded and eventually disappeared. The \nonly remnant of that idea was the selection of a master of physical culture from Bishnu \nCharan’s center, Sri Krishna Kali Bandopadhyay – an enterprising man of high character \n88 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

With the number of days \nremaining for his stay in India gradually diminishing, Swamiji began to focus on \ncompleting whatever organizational work related to India could be finished while he was \nstill in his home country. Swami Satyanandaji remained as the head of the Ranchi \nashram. Yoganandaji set up a new board of directors for the Yogoda Satsanga Society of \nIndia with himself as president, Prabhas Chandra as deputy-president, Satyanandaji as \ndirector of operations, along with Ananda Mohan Lahiri, Prakash Chandra Das and others \nfilling the remaining positions of the board. The very same Tulsi Narayan and Prakash \nChandra that Swamiji had, until now, kept apart from any organizational involvement \nwith Yogoda Satsanga, were now recruited to work for the society and that distanced \nrelationship was gone, at least visibly. On other hand, there were no appointees from \nthose members of the graduated students’ committee and the Calcutta center who in the \npast had actually carried the flag of Yogoda Satsanga through all sorts of difficulties, and \nthese aforementioned appointments naturally took all of those previous supporters by \nsurprise. However, Swamiji did have a special place in his heart for this center [Calcutta \ncenter and associated students’ committee residential quarters]. Because this branch was \nconnected with the residential quarters of the graduated students’ committee, he thought \nof this center as a main base, and he highly approved the course of work that went on at \nthe place. It is possible that he felt a need to make this residence and center a single \npermanent establishment. His first inclination was, if he had the right, to make one of his \nfather’s two houses, or at least part of one of the houses, the permanent place for Yogoda \nSatsanga in Calcutta. And he stated this wish to his father as well. But because of \nvehement protests by his younger brothers Sananda Lal and Bishnu Charan, the aged \nfather Bhagabati Charan could not comply. Quite expectedly, this conflict between \nSwamiji and his two brothers caused a rift between the older one and the younger two for \na time. Richard Wright was an observer and witnessed these exchanges, about which he \nspoke to the writer, and at which time he also expressed his great pain at seeing \nBhagabati Charan’s condition in the middle of this predicament. At that time, Swamiji did \nnot have much cash available to him. The Ranchi ashram had been purchased with a \nlump sum, and the cost of staying and traveling in India was incalculable. He did \nhowever ask the writer to look for a house that could be immediately bought for a low \nprice. Such a house was looked for and found; the deal was also set; but in the end the \nseller backed out. Swamiji’s heart’s desire was to establish a permanent property for the \nCalcutta Yogoda Satsanga, either in Calcutta proper or on its outskirts, preferably with an \nexpansive garden, and situated somewhat near the banks of the Ganges. The writer and \nPrakash Chandra found several mansion-properties on the northern edges of the city, but \nno deal could be finalized. Finally Swamiji left the clever Prakash Chandra with the \nresponsibility of finding the proper place in the future, according to Yoganandaji’s \nspecifications. But there was another imperative task that Prakash Chandra was given: \nmaking probate arrangements for Yoganandaji to legally become the owner of \nSriyukteshvarji’s physical, financial and intellectual properties which were previously \nunder the name of Sadhu Sabha, and putting “Priyadham” [Sriyukteshvarji’s home] in \nSerampore under the ownership of Yogoda Satsanga, either the entire premises or at least \nthe surrounding property. Swamiji assigned Prakash Chandra these responsibilities \nbecause Prakash Chandra was an expert at handling these court matters, as well as being \n89 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

These three were: Sudhir-da (Sudhir Roy), Panchkori-da (Panchkori De) and \nthe writer. He initiated Sudhir-da into sannyas immediately after Gurudev’s departure, \ngiving him the new name of Swami Sevananda Giri. After much coaxing by Swamiji, \nPanchkori-da agreed to take the name of Brahmachari Shantananda, and the writer \nsomehow got himself to be spared from any of this. So it can be said that fifty percent of \nYoganandaji’s wish was fulfilled, although a few years later Shantananda went back to \nusing his family name. The responsibility of using the new methods of disseminating \nYogoda teachings and initiations from Ranchi – printing and publishing reading material \ntitled “Precepta Lessons” and other such work – was given to Shantananda. Yoganandaji \nsaid that he had found this way of teaching to be very successful in America. By this \nmethod, aspirants are reached in distant places and taught spiritual practices and, at the \nsame time, the ashram benefits financially. However, it has been seen that the deep \nattainment one gains after one hears about Kriya Yoga directly from a master and then \nexperiences the teachings first-hand in a private initiation from his/her guru is extremely \ndifficult to realize by this process where a group of people read about the teachings in \ncirculars and letters and then receive initiation en masse; it is also very difficult to teach a \nspiritual science as substantial as Kriya Yoga by this method. The writer has seen proof of \nthis fact innumerable times. In any case, Swamiji was the first to use this method to \nspread the teachings of Kriya Yoga. He had said that his American students and disciples \nof Kriya Yoga numbered more than 150,000 in 1935. \n \n \nEncounters with Sages \n \n \nAmong the things Yoganandaji needed to accomplish while in India, one of the \nmost significant was gathering information about the miraculous lives of sages and saints. \nIt was known at this time that he had decided to write a book about this subject after he \nreturned to America. Whenever any word would come to him about any extraordinary \nman or woman of spirituality, he would immediately go and see that person. The writer \nwas with him some of these times. Swamiji particularly wanted to find out more about \nBabaji Maharaj [Lahiri Mahasaya’s immortal Guru]. He had gone as far as the Kumbha \nMela to find that great being, only to be unsuccessful and disappointed. One morning, \nSwamiji took the writer with him to the house of Dr. Mukherjee, a renowned physician of \nthat time in Calcutta, to meet with Sri Bhupendra Nath Sanyal, one of the eminent \ndisciples of Yogiraj Shyama Charan Lahiri. Acharya Sanyal had not himself seen Babaji \nMaharaj, but he said that he had heard that Babaji Maharaj and the Lord Lahiri Mahasaya \nlooked very similar, only that Babaji Maharaj looked a bit young. Yoganandaji restated \nthis conversation about Babaji Maharaj in his New Year’s Day talk in America on \nJanuary 1, 1937. Nowhere did Swamiji ever say that he saw Babaji Maharaj with his own \neyes. Another time, Swamiji learned from the late Sucharu Bhaduri – nephew of \nDhirananda – that there was a sage from Chandan Nagar who supposedly knew a great \nmany things about Lahiri Mahasaya’s miraculous powers, and through Sucharu-da an \n90 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda  - Life-portrait and Reminiscences (103p).pdf", "page": 92, "text": " \nappointment was set up to meet this sage inside a glass shop at China Bazar in Calcutta. \nThe time of the appointment was 3 p.m. On the specified day, Richard Wright drove \nSwamiji, Sucharu-da and the writer to that shop in China Bazar, and an audience was had \nwith that sage inside that store. Tall, impressively built, with a prominent nose and long \nhair tied in braids, somewhat fair and dressed in the ochre robe of sannyasis [ascetic \nmonks] – the man looked quite like the sages of yore. Wright had remained outside. \nSwamiji began the conversation in a cordial and gracious manner. When he asked the \nman whether he knew about the miraculous powers of Lahiri Mahasaya, the man said, \n“I’m so consumed by my own miracles, when would I have time to know about someone \nelse’s?” This answer sounded very “out of tune” to the writer’s ears. After some more \nexchanges, the sadhu [sage] pointed to his foot, saying, “You see – there is no big toe \nthere. I had to sacrifice that to save the life of a devotee who was dying from the poison \nof snakebite.” And we saw that the sadhu’s big toe was missing from his left foot. \nSomewhere during this conversation, the subject of the great saint Bholananda Giri \nMaharaj came up; he had passed away one or two years before. The sadhu said, “His \ndead body was lying on a street in Calcutta!” After hearing this, the writer could no \nlonger keep quiet and spoke out, “Really? He passed away in Hardwar! Why would his \nbody be on a street in Calcutta?” Annoyed, the sadhu maharaj said brusquely, “Do you \nknow how many Bholanandas there are? Do you keep informed about all of them?” By \nthat time the writer had surmised the substantiality of this “sage.” After this meeting was \nover, the writer asked Swamiji in the car, “Swamiji! How did you feel about this fellow? I \ncertainly thought he was a ‘number one’ fraud.” Perhaps remembering his initial \nrespectful approach to the man, Swamiji replied, “Look. Whenever I meet with people, I \ndo so completely openheartedly. If they want, it’s possible that in the beginning they can \ncheat or fool me. But when they get caught, they get caught with their hands and legs \nbound!” Almost a decade later, when the writer was carrying on his life as a worker in the \nworld and living in Chandan Nagar, he found out some interesting things about this \nparticular sadhu. His name does not come to mind. His only son was named Saagasakta \nBhanti Thakur. The sadhu had a large house for a temple which contained a shrine. His \nmany disciples – men and women, mostly from villages outside Chandan Nagar, came to \nsee him during festivals and such, when they filled both the temple premises and the \nsadhu’s financial coffer. However, the sadhu had a terrible reputation in the \nneighborhood. The young people especially despised him. One of them was the young \nman who was the landlord of the rented house in which the writer lived at the time. When \nthis young man heard the story of the sadhu’s big toe from the writer, he could not stop \nlaughing. He said that during one of the “rath” festivals [festival with a parade of \nchariots], some of the youths of the neighborhood ran a chariot’s wheel over the sadhu’s \nfoot. The sadhu had to go to the hospital and have his big toe amputated. \n \n \nAt that time, Swamiji also was in the presence of with two women sages in \nCalcutta, both called by the respectful title of “Ma” [mother]. One was “Bimala-Ma,” the \nwife of the sage Gyan Bhai. They lived in the Ramakrishna monastery of Annada Thakur \nin Eriyadaha, by the Kali Temple in Dakshineshwar. There was a school in the monastery \nfor celibate women. When Swamiji went to the monastery to visit Bimala-Ma, his \nwelcoming became somewhat of a spiritual gathering [satsang]. Devotional songs and \nchants were being sung. Bimala-Ma was seated in “virasana” [a yogic seated posture] \n91 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

As the rhythm changed in the music, her thighs began to quake and \nsuddenly, she stood up in a mythical religious pose, standing on one leg, with her eyes \nabsolutely transfixed. Gyan Bhai quickly got up and grabbed with both hands so that she \nwould not fall. Her entire body was as stiff as wood; no joint could be bent with any \neffort. Gyan Bhai carefully laid her down on a carpet right in the meeting room. After \nquite a while, Bimala-Ma, with a start, began to cry, after which her body became relaxed \nand normal again. Gyan Bhai said, “Who knows what is happening to Bimala these days. \nThis happens so often now. Sri Sri Thakur had said that every year there will be one new \nrealized being from this monastery!” \n \n \nThe second of these women sages was Sri Sri Anandamoyi Ma. Swamiji came to \nknow about her through Sucharu-da – Sucharu Bhaduri – as well [who had told Swamiji \nabout the sadhu with the missing toe]. Anandamoyi Ma was staying at that time as a guest \nat a respected and well-to-do family’s house on Rasbehari Avenue – known then as \nBaligunge Avenue – in South Calcutta. Swamiji’s car arrived at the house, where about \n25-30 devotees had gathered on the sizeable yard outside, and, they, along with members \nof the household, were standing around Anandamoyi Ma, and chanting “Ma, Ma” with \ndifferent chant-songs. It goes without saying that the writer was with Yoganandaji. \nImmediately after Swamiji was seen, Anandamoyi Ma came up to him and said, “Baba! \nBaba [father]!” and began to express great joy at seeing Yoganandaji. After a short while, \nSwamiji seated himself on the courtyard itself, and Anandamoyi Ma again spoke out \n“Baba!” and sat down on Swamiji’s lap. After satsang continued for a while, Swamiji left \nwith his companions. Gurudev was still alive when this meeting took place. The second \ntime Swamiji saw Anandamoyi Ma was on the train platform at the station in Serampore. \nIt was about 10 or 11 in the morning. Swamiji was returning to Calcutta after having seen \nGurudev. The car was traveling on the road alongside the triangular field next to the \nstation, on the way to G.T. Road. Suddenly, everyone noticed that Anandamoyi Ma was \nwaiting with a few companions on the platform of the station for a train. Procuring some \nrice flakes mixed with yogurt in a paper container, Swamiji and his assistants quickly \nparked the car under the platform, ran up the steps and greeted Ma. The conversation with \nher was again very heartwarming and tender. Swamiji offered her the rice flakes mixed \nwith yogurt. “Baba! Please feed me!” Sri Ma replied. Swamiji said, “Why don’t you take \nit with your own hands? Don’t you eat by your own hands?” “You see. Everyone’s hands \nare my hands!” answered Ma. Swamiji fed Ma some of the food and also ate a little \nhimself. It was found out later that Anandamoyi Ma did not eat by her own hands. \nSwamiji invited her to come to the Ranchi ashram. That invitation was honored some \ntime afterwards. Anandamoyi Ma stayed at the Ranchi ashram, bestowing great joy to all \nwho were there. \n \n \nIn reality, after Gurudev’s passing, Yoganandaji became somewhat restless. The \ndesire to go back to dear ones in America also awakened. A time comes to mind when the \nwriter presented a stack of letters to Swamiji and then sat down next to him. The first one \nhe opened was an envelope containing a handwritten missive. The letter was several \npages long. After reading it just a bit, Swamiji got up and began to dance, kissing the \nletter at one spot. He exclaimed, “The fellow must have been an Indian yogi in his past \nlife!” Swamiji allowed the writer to read the part of the letter he was kissing. It was \n92 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Athough he had not been able to \naccomplish all of the things he had planned during his stay in India, the pull for his \nhomeland did not have much gravity any more, now that Gurudev was gone. \n \n[*Translator’s note: The quoted statement is in English in the original.] \n \n \nJourneying Twice to Bombay on the Way to America \n \n \nIt is certain that the pain of not being able to fulfill Gurudev’s last wishes gnawed \nat Yoganandaji from within; this is evidenced by Swamiji’s desire that, before he left for \nAmerica, he would go to each of the village-centers in Midnapore in which Gurudev had \nleft his final footprints. Sriyukteshvarji had visited them all before his death. The actual \ndate of the morning does not come to mind, when Swamiji, with companions Richard \nWright and Sister Ettie, took a train on the B.N. Railway line and left Calcutta amidst the \ntears of the throng of devotees and friends who came to say farewell. One of the strongest \nmemories etched in mind is that of Atin Basu, brother-in-law of Yoganandaji’s elder-\nsister Roma Devi, garlanding Yoganandaji with an enormous garland of lotuses – a \nwreath which hung down to the feet. \n \n \nThe party reached Bombay. Preparatory activities for the journey were being \nconducted on the ship. Swamiji’s heart was heavy-laden. As he was going to sleep at \nnight at his hotel, suddenly, like a dream, he saw Sriyukteshvarji physically appear in his \nroom. Yoganandaji looked at Gurudev’s face and said, “Why are you so disappointed?! \nAre you offended so much?!” Swamiji retold this statement to the writer later; Nani \nBhaya* (Nalini Mohan) was present at the time, along with one or two others; one cannot \nnow recall exactly who they were. After this vision, Swamiji postponed his travel to \nAmerica for the time being and returned with his assistants to Calcutta. It is true however \nthat on New Year’s Day – January 1, 1937, during the first public speech after he went \nback to America, Yoganandaji described the above-mentioned event as the resurrection of \nSriyukteshvarji. A professional in the psychological sciences may say that the vision was \na reflection of Swamiji’s own pained state of mind. After returning to Calcutta, \nYoganandaji fully engaged himself with the work of the organization. Finding a \npermanent place for the Calcutta center and its associated students’ residence was of \nprimary importance. But because of circumstantial issues, efforts were not successful. It \nwas also necessary to take care of the legal matters surrounding Sadhu Sabha and \nGurudev’s physical, financial and intellectual properties. It was at this time that Swamiji \nspent a great deal of time with Prakash Chandra. Also, Swamiji still had not forgotten his \nwish to bring the writer into the path of sannyas. In any case, finally in the middle of \nSeptember 1936, Swamiji again left Calcutta and resumed his journey back to America. \nThis time he took Nani Bhaya and Tinkori Bhaya – Tinkori De, who was a schoolmate of \nthe writer since childhood and at the Ranchi Vidyalaya as well – with him to Bombay on \nthe Bombay Mail [train] from the Howrah train station.

But it seemed as if he accomplished one eon’s \nworth of work during this short time. Firmly establishing his message on Kriya Yoga, he \nflooded everyone, like the Ganges, with new hope, new certainty and new life. The \nunfathomable depth of Swamiji’s love for India and his unshakeable reverence for her is \nexpressed in every rhyme and meter of the poem he composed in America called, “My \nIndia.” Once, Swamiji told the writer, “India’s spiritual wisdom should have her on the \nhighest place in the world, but how materially poor Indians are – so imprisoned by \npoverty! I wonder if I should go around the world, holding out a beggar’s satchel for my \ncountry?!” What does a sannyasi have other than his beggar’s satchel? Apparently, \ntowards the end of his life, Swamiji used to tell his close American disciples, “I will leave \nthis mortal body while singing the praises of India!” And in terms of actual events, his \ndeparture played out exactly like this, word for word. But that account will come later. \n \n[*Translator’s note: “Bhaya” is a respectful term meaning “brother,” used to address \nfriends of the same age.] \n \nOne afternoon after Yoganandaji had returned to America, Swami Satyananda – \nmost probably under attorney’s advisement – took the writer, Nani Bhaya, Rohini and \nBishan Bose – Rohini’s friend – with him to “Priyadham,” Sriyukteshvarji’s ancestral \nhome in Serampore. Gurudev’s nephew Mano cordially invited everyone in. Mano lived \nin an inner section of the house. Arrangements were made for the party to sleep in the two \nliving rooms. Food was brought in from a restaurant for the evening meal. The room in \nwhich Sriyukteshvarji gave Kriya initiation over the years – renovated by Gurudev before \nhis departure – contained an iron safe. In the evening, Satyanandaji took the writer with \nhim into the room, locked the doors, and opened the safe. There was nothing much within \nthe vault, just a small stack of papers bundled together with a small paper wrapper. That \nbundle was given to the writer and the safe was again locked. The next day, Satyanandaji \nentrusted the two front rooms of the second floor to Rohini and Bishan, gave them the \nfunds they needed, and returned to Calcutta with the writer. Nani returned one day later. \nAfter just a few days, Rohini and Bishan were back in Calcutta with the news that Mano \nhad brought some people from the neighborhood, forced Rohini and Bishan out of the \nproperty, locked the doors from the inside of the house and took over the entire premises. \nBecause the status of Gurudev’s ancestral property was not yet settled legally, the house \nthat was a pilgrimage place for hundreds of disciples and devotees was pilfered in this \nway. \n \n \nOne day at midday at the Calcutta center, the writer found himself both astonished \nand ecstatic at the same time, when he discovered that the aforementioned wrapped \nbundle contained a letter that Gurudev had written to the Lord Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasaya, as \nwell as a stack of papers containing abbreviated commentary notes on Chapters 10 \nthrough 18 of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, written in Sriyukteshvarji’s own handwriting. \nThe Lord Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasaya’s protocol was to return the letters back to the original \nwriter with His answer written on the same pages, along with His signature. The Lord’s \nanswer in this letter contained a verse from the Atharva Veda on Shambhavi Mudra. The \nbook of spiritual commentary on the Gita that Gurudev had published during the time the \nLord was still playing out His human drama was completed up to the ninth chapter.

On the shores of the Pacific Ocean, in the town of Encinitas, \nan enchantingly beautiful “Swarna Kamala” [golden lotus] temple was built for him, \nmade possible mostly through the financial help of the sage Lynn and the physical \ncoordination directed by the devoted senior disciple and woman-sage Sister Gyan Mata. \nThis “Swarna Kamala” temple received the highest governmental commendation for \narchitecture above all other structures considered for meritorious recognition by the \nUnited States Government that year. There were three immense lotuses built on the roof \nof the temple. And to keep them from being eroded by the elements of the sea air, the \nlotuses were plated with gold; this prevented damage from natural forces and maintained \nthe brilliance of the petals at all times. The temple was created with such expertise that \nwhen Swamiji would get up on the stage in the meeting space of the temple, he would see \nnothing but vast blue ocean through the massive glass windows surrounding the room. \nHaving received this wonderful temple, Swamiji remarked, “Another dream of mine has \nnow become manifested.” The temple was secluded – apart from other properties, and the \nmeditation chamber was especially serene, where Swamiji and Mr. Lynn would remain in \nspiritual absorption for many hours. Some time later, the mass of rock on which this \nstructure was founded became eroded by the endless thrashing of waves, and the temple \neventually collapsed into the sea. A similar edifice was erected in another location \nrelatively nearby. \n \n[*Translator’s note: The word “homecoming” is in English in the original.] \n \n \nCelebration-gathering with American Devotees; Lynn Named Rajarshi \nJanakananda and Brahmachari Jotin Named Swami Premananda \n \n \nSwamiji selected the New Year’s Day celebration on January 1, 1937 as the time \nfor his first public address after his return to America. Many distinguished disciples were \ninvited to the joyous occasion, and they came from all over the United States. Among the \nnotable Indian devotees were Brahmachari Jotin, Sri Nerode, Sri Narendra Kumar Das \nand such others. Dr. Lewis from Boston – one of the oldest supporters of Swamiji, Saint \nLynn, Sister Gyan Mata, Sister Sraddha, as well as other devotees from the Mount \nWashington center were among the American disciples attending. It can be said that it \nwas at this occasion that Lynn was recognized as being in the second position in the \nhierarchy after Swamiji. A short while after this event, Lynn began to reside permanently \nat the Mount Washington center, and Yoganandaji bestowed upon him the spiritual name \nof Rajarshi Janakananda, although he never was formally initiated into the path of \nsannyas. Swamiji often said that his reason for coming to America was fulfilled by \n96 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Close devotees reverentially said that Swamiji and Lynn were two \nflames from the same spiritual Light. Also at this time, Swamiji initiated Brahmachari \nJotin according to scriptural injunctions into the path of sannyas, giving him the name of \n“Swami Premananda.” \n \n \nIf examined, the speech Yoganandaji gave at that reunion celebration reveals \nmuch. The first noticeable thing is that up to that point, he had never used the name \n“Paramhansa Yogananda”; he was always known previously as “Swami Yogananda.” It \nwas in his autobiography that he first makes it known that Gurudev Swami \nSriyukteshvarji bestowed the title of “paramhansa” on Yoganandaji while he was in India. \nHowever, the writer and others who were close to him were not aware of this happening. \nSwamiji himself had never mentioned this news to anyone. Any sannyasi [renunciate], \nsadhu [sage] or brahmachari [celibate aspirant] can be given the title of “paramhansa”; \nthis is one of the wonderful aspects of Hindu culture. Swami Satyanandaji had said, \n“Yogananda was attracted to the ‘paramhansa’ title since childhood.” One humorous \nincident comes to mind regarding this. Once at dusk, Swamiji was urinating at a drainage \nspot in the front alley by Gurudev’s house in Serampore. Gurudev was standing on the \nsecond floor veranda and speaking to someone when he jokingly remarked, “Yogananda \nhas become a ‘paramhansa’ [great swan]!” Ananda-da [Ananda Mohan Lahiri] and the \nwriter were standing by the front door of the house. They and Swamiji heard Gurudev’s \nironic joke. Swamiji came to the front door and said, “Ananda-da! Did you hear? Swamiji \n[Sriyukteshvarji] called me a ‘paramhansa’ [great soul]!” Ananda-da softly said to the \nwriter, “You’ll see! Yogananda will use this title in the future, for certain.” It is not \npossible to understand why Swamiji did not announce at the speech of New Year’s Day in \n1937 that Gurudev bestowed this title on him, and why he revealed this only in his \nautobiography later.  \n \n \nThe Picture of Babaji Maharaj \n \n \nAnother point of interest in this reunion speech is Swamiji’s references to \nMahamuni Babaji Maharaj, the Divine Master of Kriya Yoga. It is clear by this lecture \nthat Yoganandaji did not directly see Babaji Maharaj. Later however, his organization \nwent on propagating a drawing of Babaji Maharaj saying that this is how Swamiji had \nseen him. This contradiction is astounding and deluding. In truth, there is no similarity \nwith this picture and the description of Babaji Maharaj given by Yoganandaji’s Gurudev \nSriyukteshvarji, nor is there any similarity in the picture with the descriptions of the \nDivine Master given by Sri Sri Shyama Charan Lahiri’s other senior disciples of old. In \n1978, the writer asked Sananda Lal about this matter. He said that his “Mejda” [middle \nelder brother] – meaning Swamiji – saw Babaji Maharaj at their house on Garpar Road, \nand that that image of the Divine Master was drawn according to Swamiji’s instructions \nby Sananda Lal. The description of Babaji Maharaj that the writer wrote in his book on \nKriya Yoga in English was ascertained from conversations with Sriyukteshvarji, and \nSananda Lal concurred that he had also heard Sriyukteshvarji give the same description \nof Babaji Maharaj [as the writer had heard in his conversations with Sriyukteshvarji]*.  \n \n97 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

After passing some time the \nsaint asked the author to accompany him to the ancestral house of Paramhansa \nYogananda, which was not far from the dormitory. We were not required to go to the \nhouse as Shri Sananda Lal Ghosh, third brother of Yoganandaji, appeared on the road in \nfront of the house. Sananda Lal is a reputed artist, expert in drawing portraits. He is now \nin his eighties and is still hale and hearty. Seeing him the Swami said he was looking for \nhim. Then he asked him to draw a picture of the Babaji Maharaj stating that this would \nnot be difficult for him. He was simply to make the picture of Lahiri Mahasaya in a \nstanding position, make locks of hair a little longer and flowing over the shoulders, free \nend of the narrow Dhoti worn made to go round the shoulders and resting on the right \narm held in a right angle like that of an up-country cow boy, and the left hand hanging \nparallel to the body. Face would be exactly like that of Lahiri Mahasaya but should look \nmuch younger. The Swami assured Sananda Lal that he could do it without much \ndifficulty. But the artist became bewildered. How could he paint such a picture he \ndemurred and whose picture he would succeed in drawing he would not know. He \nexpressed strong diffidence in succeeding to accomplishing the task as desired. Sri \nYukteshvar re-assured him of his success and left. However, Sananda Lal did not dare to \nhandle the task, perhaps considering the holiness of the individual involved.

We are told that once Babaji wanted to give up his body. One \nof his advanced disciples objected. Babaji reasoned, “What is the \ndifference if I keep a dream body or not? I am alive evermore with or \nwithout a body.” Then the great disciple of Babaji asked, “Honored Guru-\npreceptor, if it is the same with you to keep your body or dissolve it in the \ncosmic stream, why not keep it just for a change?” Babaji answered that \n98 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Swami \nKeshabananda hinted a message from Babaji to me when I visited \nKeshabanandaji’s hermitage in Brindaban, India. Swami Keshabananda \nespecially urged, “Yogananda, sometime you must see Badri Narayan \nHimalayas, for there I met Babaji.” \n \n[Inner Culture – March 1937] \n \n \n \nThe above article written by Swamiji in his institution’s primary journal and his \nspeech on the 1st of January 1937 shows that at least up until that time he had not seen \nBabaji Maharaj directly. Swamiji did not again come to India as well, so the issue of \ngoing to the Himalayas and Badri Narayan cannot even be brought up. Yoganandaji was a \nman who lived in the world of imagination and spiritual feelings. He saw some things \ndirectly and some things with the eyes of his feelings. Towards the end, he often did not \nperceive a difference between the two. In any case, in the perspective of a historical \nbiographer, there is no believable evidence that the propagated picture of Babaji Maharaj \nwas drawn from having seen the Divine Master directly. \n \n \nBrahmachari Premeshwarananda or Swami Vinayananda Giri \n \n \nThe change in the mode and direction of work at the main center in Ranchi \nnecessitated new workers to join the organization. At this time, a young man named \nSachin Chakrabarty began working for Yogoda Satsanga. Although he was not highly \neducated, he had worked in Bharat Sevashram for a while, which gave him some general \nfamiliarity with the ways and needs of a spiritually oriented institution. But behind it all, \nthe man’s main reason for joining Yogoda Satsanga’s workforce was to be a part of an \ninternationally powerful organization, and his primary and ultimate goal was to go to \nAmerica. When he came into contact with the writer in Calcutta, Sachin Chakrabarty \nimmediately asked about the possibilities of working with the Ranchi center, as well as \nbringing up the subject of traveling to America several times. \n \n \nAfter joining the Ranchi center, he began to write a steady stream of letters to \nYoganandaji, hoping to gain Swamiji’s trust. Sachin was being secretly encouraged in \nthis endeavor by Prakash Chandra. Prakash Chandra was in charge of carrying out some \nimportant work in India for Yoganandaji, but he had no time or place for the old workers \nand supporters of the organization – far be it for him to have any respect for them \nwhatsoever. He observed that the veteran workers of Yogoda Satsanga were all students \nand followers of Swami Satyananda. In order to diminish Swami Satyananda’s influence, \nit was necessary to concoct some unflattering and distorted information about him and \n99 \n www.yoganiketan.net \n"}

Expert and \nexperienced at worldly affairs and conspiracy, Prakash Chandra easily had Sachin on his \nside. He told Sachin that in exchange he would try to get him to America via Swamiji. \nThe first evidence that this conspiratorial effort was bearing fruit was seen when \nSatyanandaji received a letter from Yoganandaji asking him to initiate Sachin into the \nvows of a brahmachari [celibate aspirant] with the new name of Brahmachari \nPremeshwarananda. Brahmachari Premeshwarananda did not have to stay long in India \nafter his renunciate initiation. Yoganandaji had him go to America, and initiated him there \ninto the path of sannyas [full renunciation], giving him the name of Swami Vinayananda. \nHowever, Swami Vinayananda [Sachin Chakrabarty] was not able to stay in America for \nlong. \n \n \nSwami Yogananda’s youngest brother Bishnu Charan went with his future son-in-\nlaw Buddha Bose to Swamiji’s ashram in America. Within only a few days, Bishnu \nCharan saw many incidents of unbecoming and suspicious behavior by Vinayananda and \nmade Yoganandaji aware of these, after which Yoganandaji’s perception of Vinayananda \ncompletely changed. Vinayananda then became a problem for Yoganandaji. The open-\nhearted and love-filled Yoganandaji did not have an easy time when he had to make harsh \nand stern decisions against someone. At the same time, he also could not take the chance \nof a troublesome Vinayananda causing problems for him in America. In the end, \nVinayananda was sent back to India with the title of “president” for the Yogoda Satsanga \nin India. This way, the American part of the organization was free of any more \ncomplications from this situation. However, this arrangement certainly caused noticeable \ndiscontent to rise in the Indian part of the organization, which eventually resulted in the \nformal resignation of several distinguished members of the workforce of Yogoda \nSatsanga in India. \n \n \nNo further efforts were made to take any more brahmachari workers to America \nfrom India. Other than a few Indians in the United States, the many American men and \nwomen who became part of the workforce of Swamiji’s Yogoda Satsanga – who \ndemonstrated great reverence for the practice of Kriya Yoga and devotion towards \nSwamiji – greatly aided the work of propagating the message. Quite a few men and \nwomen among these have taken it upon themselves [separated from Yogoda Satsanga] to \nspread Paramhansa Yogananda’s yogic teachings and yogic message in different citites, \nguided by their own spiritual realizations. \n \n \nPublishing His Autobiography \n \n \nWithin a few years after his return to America, Yogananda published his world-\nrenowned book, “Autobiography of a Yogi.” It has already been mentioned that he was \ngathering information on the wondrous and miraculous lives of yogis and realized beings \nof India while he was in his homeland; he wanted to bring out these accounts to the \nmasses. This extensive work, written in his naturally fluent and moving English, \nimmediately stirred an awakening world-wide. Within a short time, this book was being \npublished in 56 languages.

Although, \nwhen examined with an investigative eye, many of the accounts could have been caused \nby ordinary means, nevertheless, in Swamiji’s perception, all happened supernaturally. To \nthe observers around the world of extra-rational and extra-sensory phenomena, this \nunparalleled book became known as the authoritative work to have such events on record. \n \n \nResolute Faith in Kriya Yoga \n \n \nIt was stated at the very beginning of this life-portrait that the heart-oriented way \nof being was Swami Yogananda’s primary trait. No where else in this world could this \nquality have found such fertile ground for expression than the naturally open atmosphere \nof America. For this reason, the men and women of America very easily took Yogananda \nin as one of their own. If anyone would come into contact with him just once, that person \nwould, for the rest of his life, hold Yogananda in the highest place of reverence. Many of \nthe old devotees left in Yoganandaji’s absence, but in the end, he was held as a king in \ntheir hearts, and this continues to be so. His magnanimous, free-flowing love and joyous \nspiritual radiance was completely integrated – a perfect match – with the ways of \nAmerican life. In his book “Hinduism Invades America,” Professor Wendell Thomas of \nthe University of Illinois speaks highly of Yogananda spreading his message in America \nusing such a novel and appealing approach. The professor said, “Yogananda completely \ndove into the American way of life!”* However, he also did not let his commentary go \nwithout some words of caution, saying, “Whether the message changes to something else \nin the end remains to be known.”** But there is a great deal of evidence that shows that \nthe essential message did not change. Behind every effort by Yogananda was the root \npurpose of attracting men and women to Kriya Yoga, no matter what the means. If people \nwere captivated by feats of ordinary mental power – no harm in that; let it be so. Or there \ncould be other ways by which people could be drawn. Swamiji’s reverence for Kriya \nYoga was profound and deep. While in India, he once told the author, “If Kriya can enter \nin, in any way whatsoever, then it’s all over!” Swamiji felt and said that the \nComforter,*** Whom Lord Jesus Christ said would come after him, is the path of Kriya \nYoga – the “messenger of Peace.” The discontent expressed at times by some older \nKriyavans in India at Yogananda’s “lightweight” ways of spreading Kriya Yoga comes \nfrom fearing a degeneration and disappearance of Kriya Yoga’s original methods. \n \n[* and **Translator’s note: These quoted statements from Wendell Thomas’ book are in \nBengali in the original manuscript.
