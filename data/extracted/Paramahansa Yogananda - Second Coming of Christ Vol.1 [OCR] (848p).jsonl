{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Second Coming of Christ Vol.1 [OCR] (848p).pdf", "page": 5, "text": "T H E SPIRITUAL L E G A C Y OF PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDA \nParamahansa Yogananda (1893-1952) is widely recognized as one of the \npreeminent spiritual figures of our time, and the influence of his life and work \ncontinues to grow. Many of the religious and philosophical concepts and \nmethods he introduced decades ago are now finding expression in education, \npsychology, business, medicine, and other spheres of endeavor—contributing \nin far-reaching ways to a more integrated, humane, and spiritual vision of hu-\nman life. \nThe fact that Paramahansa Yogananda's teachings are being interpreted \nand creatively applied in many different fields, as well as by exponents of di-\nverse philosophical and metaphysical movements, points not only to the great \npractical utility of what he taught. It also makes clear the need for some \nmeans of ensuring that the spiritual legacy he left not be diluted, fragmented, \nor distorted with the passing of time. \nWith the increasing variety of sources of information about Parama-\nhansa Yogananda, readers sometimes inquire how they can be certain that a \npublication accurately presents his life and teachings. In response to these in-\nquiries, we would like to explain that Sri Yogananda founded Self-Realization \nFellowship to disseminate his teachings and to preserve their purity and integ-\nrity for future generations. He personally chose and trained those close disci-\nples who head the Self-Realization Fellowship Publications Council, and gave \nthem specific guidelines for the preparation and publishing of his lectures, \nwritings, and Self-Realization \nLessons. The members of the SRF Publications \nCouncil honor these guidelines as a sacred trust, in order that the universal \nmessage of this beloved world teacher may live on in its original power and \nauthenticity. \nThe Self-Realization Fellowship name and the SRF emblem (shown \nabove) were originated by Sri Yogananda to identify the organization he \nfounded to carry on his worldwide spiritual and humanitarian work. These \nappear on all Self-Realization Fellowship books, audio and video recordings, \nfilms, and other publications, assuring the reader that a work originates with \nthe organization founded by Paramahansa Yogananda and faithfully conveys \nhis teachings as he himself intended they be given. \n—SELF-REALIZATION FELLOWSHIP \nIV \n"}

Indeed, I was not only to witness in Paramahan-\nsaji a living exemplar of this scriptural wisdom, but personally to \nrecord numerous lectures, temple services, informal talks, and writings \nin which he explicated the teachings of Jesus. \nThe scope and content of The Second \nComing \nof Christ are \nclearly set forth in the author's Introduction and the Discourses that \nfollow. But perhaps it will add to the reader's appreciation to know \nsomething of the genesis of this work, of which I can speak firsthand \n—from its inception to the culminating presentation in these pages. \nParamahansaji—as a delegate to the International Congress of \nReligious Liberals in Boston—had arrived in America in 1920 to un-\ndertake the mission given him by a line of enlightened masters in In-\ndia:* to spread worldwide the ancient soul-science of yoga meditation, \nand (as he expressed in the Aims and Ideals of Self-Realization Fel-\nlowship) \"to reveal the complete harmony and basic oneness of orig-\ninal Christianity as taught by Jesus Christ and original Yoga as taught \nby Bhagavan Krishna; and to show that these principles of truth are \nthe common scientific foundation of all true religions.\" The fulfillment \nof this sacred responsibility was his lifelong endeavor—beginning \nwith classes in Boston in his first years in this country and continuing \nwith ever newly expressed inspirations to the last days before his pass-\ning more than thirty years later. \nAfter a few years in Boston, Paramahansaji embarked on a pro-\ngram of lectures and class series that, over the course of the next \ndecade, took him over the length and breadth of the United States. \nHe taught in nearly all the major cities; overflow audiences in the \nlargest auditoriums were spellbound by his great wisdom and love for \nGod — and by his dynamic personality, which was itself an explicit \ntestimony to the practicality of the applied spiritual science he taught. \nThe introduction of his unique exposition of the teachings of Jesus \nChrist dissolved theological boundaries between the liberating path \nto God's kingdom revealed by Lord Jesus and the Yoga science of \nGod-union taught by Bhagavan Krishna in the sacred scripture of In-\ndia, the Bhagavad Gita.

In 1932, not long after I \njoined the ashram at Mount Washington, the Guru found time, amidst \norganizational demands and travel to fulfill lecture engagements, to \nbegin including commentaries on the Gospels and the Bhagavad Gita \nin the magazine he had founded a few years earlier. Each installment \nconsisted of a few verses of both scriptures along with Paramahansaji's \nexplanations. \"These spiritual interpretations are the result of a long-\nunfulfilled promise to Yogoda students,\" he announced in the maga-\nzine.* Not infrequently, the copy was mailed to the magazine staff \nfrom whatever faraway city he was lecturing in at the time—even dur-\ning his extended trip to India via Europe and Palestine in 1 9 3 5 - 3 6 . \nOf Paramahansaji's numerous remarkable experiences during that \njourney to India, especially of note in connection with this book is his \nvisit to the Holy Land. In a letter sent from Jerusalem to his exalted \ndisciple in America, Rajarsi Janakananda,f the Guru wrote of his ex-\nperiences with Christ: \"There are no words adequate enough to express \nto you the joy and the vision and the blessedness which I perceived \nhere.

His name is \nalive as before; only the Jesus that was and walked and suffered in the \nstreets of Jerusalem very few people see. He was with me everywhere; \nand a very special communion I had in Bethlehem where he was born \nas the little babe body of Jesus. He touched me as I entered the ancient \nmenagerie where Mary brought him into the world—in a humble lit-\ntle stable under an inn. This place is absolutely authentic. I know it \nfrom the Divine.

Accordingly, in preparing this \nbook, wording of the verses from the King James Bible has been used \nthroughout, and parallel references from all the Gospels have been \ncited in order to insure a thorough presentation of Jesus' words. \nIn the fifty years since Paramahansaji's passing, advances in phys-\nics, medicine, biology, and other fields—as well as archaeological and \nhistorical research that has shed much light on the early Christian \nmovement—have contributed additional scientific and historical in-\nformation pertinent to Paramahansaji's farseeing spiritual vision and \nunderstanding of Jesus' life and world mission.

Buddha \nbrought heart back into the arid theology and mechanical rituals into \nwhich the ancient Vedic religion of India had fallen after the passing of \na higher age in which Bhagavan Krishna, India's most beloved of avatars, \npreached the way of divine love and God-realization through the prac-\ntice of the supreme spiritual science of yoga, union with God. \n\"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life \nfor his friends.\"* Such was the exceptional mission shouldered by \nJesus.

Karen Armstrong in A History of \nGod: The 4,000-Year \nQuest of Judaism, \nChristianity and Islam (New York: Alfred A. \nKnopf, 1993) writes: \"The author of the Book of Proverbs, who was writing in the third \ncentury BCE...personifies Wisdom so that she seems a separate person: \n\"Yahweh \ncreated me [Wisdom] \nwhen his purpose first unfolded, \nbefore the \noldest of his works. From everlasting I was firmly set, from the \nbeginning, \nbefore earth came into being...when \nhe laid the foundations \nof the earth, I \nwas at his side, a master craftsman, delighting him day after day, ever at play \nin his presence, at play everywhere \nin the world, delighting \nto be with the \nsons of men\" \n(Proverbs 8 : 2 2 - 2 3 , 3 0 - 3 1 ; The Jerusalem Bible).... \n\"In the Aramaic translations of the Hebrew scriptures known as the \ntargums, \nwhich were being composed at this time [i.e., when John's Gospel was written], the \nterm Memra (word) is used to describe God's activity in the world. It performs the same \nfunction as other technical terms like 'glory,' 'Holy Spirit' and 'Shekinah' which em-\nphasized the distinction between God's presence in the world and the incomprehensi-\nble reality of God itself. Like the divine Wisdom, the 'Word' symbolized God's origi-\nnal plan for creation.\" \nThe writings of early Church Fathers also indicate that this was the meaning in-\ntended by Saint John. In Clement of Alexandria \n(Edinburgh: William Blackwood and \nSons, 1 9 1 4 ) John Patrick states: \"Clement repeatedly identifies the Word with the Wis-\ndom of God.\" And Dr. Anne Pasquier, professor of theology at Universite Laval, Que-\nbec, writes in The Nag Hammadi \nLibrary After Fifty Years (John D.

All nouns in \nGreek are either masculine, feminine, or neuter in gender. The noun logos (\"word\") is \nmasculine, apparently leading English translators to use the masculine pronoun \"him\" \nwhen referring to \"the Word.\" However, since English does not differentiate the gen-\nder of nouns such as \"word,\" the correct pronoun in translation would be \"it\" — un-\nless referring to a person, in which case the personal pronoun \"him\" would be appro-\npriate. Thus, the use of \"him\" reflects a theological interpretation by the translator \nthat \"the Word\" in fact signifies a person: Jesus. \nThis interpretation became accepted as church orthodoxy in large part through the \nefforts of Irenaeus, second-century bishop of Lyons and author of the influential work \nAgainst Heresies. Dr. Elaine Pagels, professor of religion at Princeton University, writes \nin Beyond Belief (New York: Random House, 2003): \"Irenaeus tells us that Valenti-\nnus's disciple Ptolemy, reading these words [John 1 : 1 - 3 ] , envisioned God, word, and \nfinally Jesus Christ as, so to speak, waves of divine energy flowing down from above; \nthus, he suggests, the infinite divine Source above reveals itself in diminished form in \nthe divine word, which reveals itself, in turn, in the more limited form of the human \nJesus....Irenaeus challenges Ptolemy's interpretation of John's prologue and argues in-\nstead that 'God the Father' is equivalent to the word, and the word is equivalent to \n'Jesus Christ.'...What Irenaeus's successors would derive from this was a kind of sim-\nple, almost mathematical equation, in which God=«/or^=Jesus Christ. That many \nChristians to this day consider some version of this equation the essence of Christian \nbelief is a mark of Irenaeus's accomplishment—and his success....Because Irenaeus's \nbold interpretation came virtually to define orthodoxy, those who read John's gospel \ntoday in any language except the Greek original will find that the translations make \nhis conclusion seem obvious.\" \nHowever, the \"Word\" (as also \"the only begotten Son\") came to signify the per-\nson of Jesus only through a gradual evolution of doctrine brought about by complex \ntheological and political influences. It was not until the fourth century, writes historian \nKaren Armstrong in A History of God (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1993), that the \nchurch came to \"adopt an exclusive notion of religious truth: Jesus was the first and \nlast Word of God to the human race.\" (Publisher's \nNote) \nfSee Discourse 7, which explains the dual nature assumed by the Cosmic Creative Vi-\nbration: pure Holy Ghost in tune with God's will; and obstructive Cosmic Satan, orig-\ninator of all evil, which tries to divorce all creatures from their Creator. \n15 \n"}

St. Jerome writes \nthat St. Thomas preached the Gospel to the Magi and finally slept, that is died, in India.\" \nFather Heras points out: \"If therefore the Magi were rishis of India, the traditional \nland of wisdom, it is not to be wondered at that they offered gold, frankincense, and \nmyrrh to the infant and his mother, since these were precisely the gifts that from the \nmost ancient times were offered in India to the parents of the newly born....The cus-\ntom of offering these three gifts to the parents of the recently born does not now exist \nin Persia; nor do scholars know that any such custom ever existed in that country.\" \nCenturies-old traditions in India itself refer to the Wise Men as having come from \nthat land. Fernao do Queyroz, a seventeenth-century Portuguese Jesuit priest who lived \nin Goa (Portuguese colony on the west coast of India), cited the work of earlier histo-\nrians (Manuel dos Anjos and Jeronimo Osorio, both of the sixteenth century) who \nwrote that when the famous Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama reached India in May \n1498, he found at Calicut on the western coast a Hindu temple dedicated to the Vir-\ngin Mary.

Da Gama was informed that Perimale \"was a Brahmin, one of the wisest in India, \nand was one of the three Magi who went to Bethlehem\" to adore the baby Jesus; on \nhis return to Calicut he had the temple erected. \nAnother account is found in the writings of Joao De Barros, a sixteenth-century \nPortuguese historian, who mentions the Malabar tradition that a king from South In-\ndia named \"Pirimal\" went to Mascate and thence with others to Bethlehem to adore \nthe infant Jesus.

Yet Sabinus, the \nBishop of Heraclea, affirms that 'excepting Constantine himself, and Eu-\nsebius Pamphilus, these were a set of illiterate simple creatures that un-\nderstood nothing.'\" One can hardly suppress at least a modicum of men-\ntal fraternity with the commentator John Jortin (1698-1770; archdeacon \nof London) who, we are told by Hone, in analyzing the authority of these \nGeneral Councils wryly concluded: \"The Council held by the Apostles at \nJerusalem [Acts 1] was the first and the last in which the Holy Spirit may \nbe affirmed to have presided.\"* \nThe influence of the dark age in which Jesus took incarnation, and \nwhich continued for several successive centuries, may well be faulted \nas providing a confounding background of ignorance and superstition \nthat led the church fathers to exclude certain texts from the official \ncanon of scripture.

As the child emerges from infancy, he begins a \nmore conscious wielding of his God-given powers. The legendary \ntellings might well be misconstrued as describing a child with powers \nover matter and life and death itself who is of a capricious, even petu-\nlant, nature, at whose command the elements obey. Certainly, in and \nof itself this literal acceptance of the tales would rightly doom them to \nthe ash heap of heresy. Whatever vestiges of authenticity may breathe \nwithin these legends must be viewed in the light of the singular pur-\npose for which saviors come to earth. No vindictive or arrogant intent \nmotivates the actions of such a one. If indeed, according to the ac-\ncounts, some persons were withered or struck blind or lifeless in their \nencounters with the child Jesus, it was through his command that \nsome consequence from their past-life evils was thereby mitigated. \nCorrespondingly, children who taunted Elisha were destroyed by bears \nsummoned from the woods by the prophet, not as an act of wrath, but \nin recognition of a present cause providing the opportunity for the \natonement and expiation of long-past evil actions—fruition of the law \nof karma, cause and effect, God's law of justice.* It is, in fact, noted \nin the scriptures of India that karmic justice dispensed by the hand of \nwrites of a tradition traceable to Peter, third-century bishop of Alexandria, who pur-\nportedly said that \"the place in Egypt where Christ was banished is now called \nMatarea, about ten miles beyond Cairo; that the inhabitants constantly burn a lamp \nin remembrance of it; and that there is a garden of trees yielding a balsam, which were \nplanted by Christ when a boy.\" (The Infancy Gospel itself refers to the balsam trees as \nhaving grown on that site after Mary washed Jesus' clothes there in a spring that \ngushed forth at the command of the divine child.) \n* \"It is written in the Bible (II Kings 2:24) that a crowd of children ridiculed the \nprophet Elisha. He then 'cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth \ntwo she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.' As a prophet \nof God, Elisha was acting as His instrument. The curse was karmically ordained \nthrough God's law; hence Elisha cannot be accused of causing the mutilation of the \nchildren. They suffered because of their own wickedness—the accumulation of their \nwrong thoughts and actions of past lives. Their seemingly childish taunting was the \ntimely fruition of their past evil, which precipitated its inevitable consequence. The \n'curse' that issued forth from the instrumental Elisha was the 'high voltage' of his spir-\nitual vibration, operating with no selfish intent to harm. \n\"If a man disregards a warning not to touch a live wire and is electrocuted, it is \nnot the live wire but the man's foolishness that is responsible for his death. The same \ntruth applies in the case of the wicked children who mocked Elisha.

More often than not, those who \nsuffered death or affliction at his command were restored by him to life \nand health, just as later in his ministry he withdrew life from the fig \ntree and caused it to wither and restored life to Lazarus and raised him \nfrom the dead. Nature's laws are activated quite ingenuously by one \nwho knows his unity with the omnipresent Universal Consciousness \nthrough which all existences are created, sustained, and dissolved. \nIt is related in the Infancy Gospels that father Joseph found the ex-\ntraordinary talent of his son of incredible assistance in his carpentry \ntrade—not as an artisan with hammer and chisel, but when by error \n\"Joseph had any thing to make longer or shorter, or wider or narrower, \nthe Lord Jesus would stretch forth his hand towards it. And presently \nit would become as Joseph would have it.\" After two years of labor on \na commissioned throne for the ruler of Jerusalem, the seat was found \nto be lacking \"two spans on each side, of the appointed measure.\" The \nking was angry and Joseph fearful; whereupon Jesus directed his father \nto pull on one side while he pulled on the opposite.* And when \"each \nof them had with strength drawn his side, the throne obeyed, and was \nbrought to the proper dimension of the place: which miracle when they \nwho stood by saw, they were astonished, and praised God.\" (This was \nas elementary for Jesus as later it would be for him to change water \ninto wine, or to multiply the loaves and fishes. )f \n* \"King\" is most likely a reference to Archelaus, ruler until A.D. 6.

So he published his \nnotes himself in 1894 under the title The Unknown \nLife of Jesus \nChrist. In his publication, he urged that a qualified research team be \ndispatched to view and judge for itself the value of these previously se-\ncreted documents.

His Holiness visited \nAmerica on a speaking tour of major universities in 1958; his historic tour—the first \ntime any Shankaracharya had traveled to the West—was sponsored by Self-Realization \nFellowship. Sri Daya Mata, president and spiritual head of Self-Realization Fellowship, \nwrote: \"In my discussions with His Holiness during my visits with him in India, he told \nme that there is proof positive, to which he had access, that as Paramahansaji has stated, \nJesus Christ was in India as a young lad and received training in the monasteries there. \nThe Shankaracharya further told me that, God willing, it was his hope to translate these \ndocuments and write a book about this period in the life of Jesus.

But he took issue with some precepts of the Brah-\nminic orthodoxy. He openly denounced their practices of caste big-\notry; many of the priestly rituals; and the emphasis on worship of \nmany gods in idolic form rather than sole reverence for the one \nSupreme Spirit, the pure monotheistic essence of Hinduism which had \nbecome obscured by outer ritualistic concepts. \nDistancing himself from these disputes, Jesus left Puri. He spent the \nnext six years with the Sakya Buddhist sect in the Himalayan moun-\ntainous regions of Nepal and Tibet. This Buddhist sect was monotheis-\ntic, having separated itself from the distorted Hinduism that prevailed \nduring the dark age of Kali Yuga.* \nThough true God-realized masters have arisen in India in every \nage, preserving from generation to generation the eternal truths of \nSpirit (Sanatana Dharma), the outward religious \npractices of the masses have undergone cycles of \nprogress and degradation as have the religions of \nother lands and cultures. According to my guru, \nSwami Sri Yukteswar, the most recent descending \nand ascending Dark Ages (Kali Yuga) lasted from \nabout 700 B.C. to A.D. 1700. In India, this period saw the gradual per-\nversion and loss of the sublime spiritual science of the Vedas and Upa-\nnishads, resulting in priestly adherence to a number of misunderstood \nprecepts falsely held to be taught by the scriptures. It was during this \ntime of spiritual darkness that the avatar Gautama Buddha took in-\ncarnation in India (c. 563 B.C.), to right some of the gross abuses of \na \" J \" but with an \"I,\" as in Latin and Greek (Iesous). Even today, in Spanish, though \nspelled with a \"J,\" Jesus is pronounced \"Hay-soos.\" \nThe Biblical account, given in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew (see Discourse 2), \nis that both Mary and Joseph were instructed by an angel that the divine child was to \nbe named Yeshua, \"savior\" (in Greek, Iesous; in English, Jesus): \"...thou shah call his \nname Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins\" (Matthew 1:21). The Hebrew \nword Yeshua is a contraction of Yehoshua, \"Yahweh (Jehovah, the Creator) is salva-\ntion.\" However, the language of daily use for Jesus and his fellow Galileans was not \nHebrew, but the related dialect Aramaic, in which his name would have been pro-\nnounced \"Eshu.\" Thus, strangely enough, the name predicted for Jesus by the angel, \nand given to him by his family, was remarkably akin to the more ancient Sanskrit name \nbestowed by the Wise Men. Aside from the phonetic similarities, there is an underly-\ning unity of meaning of the words Isha and Yeshua—the \ntwo appellations bestowed \non the one revered by millions as \"Lord and Savior.\" (Publisher's \nNote) \n*The yugas, or world cycles of civilization, are explained in Discourse 39. \nCycles of progress and \ndegradation in out-\nward expression of \nreligion \n86 \n"}

There are two ways to know an avatar. \nFirst, to glimpse his essence that shines through a melange of fact, leg-\nend, innocent or purposeful distortion; and by discriminatively sifting \nthe significant from the unimportant, just as a person is recognized for \nhimself apart from the accoutrements he wears. And second, to have \ndirect knowledge of a great one through intuitive divine communion \nwith that soul — as many through the centuries have known Jesus \nChrist, such as Saint Francis of Assisi to whom Jesus appeared nightly \nin flesh and blood, Saint Teresa of Avila, and many others of the Chris-\ntian faith; and such as Sri Ramakrishna of the Hindu faith, and I also \nwho have been many times in the manifested presence of Jesus.

Most \nof the writings use Christian terminology, unmistakably related to a Jewish heritage. \nMany claim to offer traditions about Jesus that are secret, hidden from 'the many' who \nconstitute what, in the second century, came to be called the 'catholic church.' These \nChristians are now called gnostics, from the Greek word gnosis, usually translated as \n'knowledge.' For as those who claim to know nothing about ultimate reality are called \nagnostic (literally, 'not-knowing'), the person who does claim to know such things is \ncalled gnostic ('knowing'). But gnosis is not primarily rational knowledge.... As the \ngnostics use the term, we could translate it as 'insight,' for gnosis involves an intuitive \nprocess of knowing oneself....[According to gnostic teachers,] to know oneself, at the \ndeepest level, is simultaneously to know God; this is the secret of \ngnosis.... \n\"The 'living Jesus' of these texts speaks of illusion and enlightenment, not of sin \nand repentance, like the Jesus of the New Testament.

Because you have drunk, you have become drunk from the bubbling stream \nwhich I have measured out....He who will drink from my mouth will become as I am: \nI myself shall become he, and the things that are hidden will be revealed to him.' \n\"Does not such teaching—the identity of the divine and human, the concern with \nillusion and enlightenment, the founder who is presented not as Lord, but as spiritual \nguide—sound more Eastern than Western?...Could Hindu or Buddhist tradition have \ninfluenced gnosticism?...Ideas that we associate with Eastern religions emerged in the \nfirst century through the gnostic movement in the West, but they were suppressed and \ncondemned by polemicists like Irenaeus.\" (Publisher's \nNote) \n90 \n"}

Many believe that John was \nassociated with the Essenes and their ascetic and esoteric practices; in-\ncluded among their ceremonies was baptism for purification of the \nbody and spirit.f When John made himself known in the environs of \nJudea, crowds followed him as a saint and prophet. His renown made \nT o r this entire group of verses, cf. parallel references in Mark 1 : 1 - 8 and Luke 3 : 1 - 1 8 . \nSee Discourse 56, page 1099, for commentary on verse 12. \ntSee Luke 1:80, Discourse 2: \"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was \nin the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.\" The Bible gives no further infor-\nmation on the childhood and youth of John the Baptist. The Essenes were an ascetical \nJewish sect extant from about 1 5 0 B.C. until the end of the first century A.D. The Jew-\nish historian Flavius Josephus (c. A.D. 3 7 - 1 0 0 ) describes the Essenes in his Antiquities \nof the Jews (Book 18, Chap. 1, No. 2). The Roman scholar Pliny the Elder (A.D. 2 3 -\n79) wrote that the Essenes lived near the Dead Sea in the hills above Ein Gedi (where \nin 1998 Israeli archaeologists excavated what are believed to be ruins of an Essene \ncommunity). Many similarities exist between what historians know of the Essene way \nof life and that of John the Baptist described in the Gospels. In addition to purificatory \nbaptism by water, there is also evidence that they adhered to a vegetarian diet. They \nmaintained monastic-like communities in the desert in order to separate themselves from \nwhat they saw as the corrupt and worldly practices of the priests and populace. \n\"The Essene, like the Indian yogi, sought to obtain divine union and the 'gifts of the \nSpirit' by solitary reverie in retired spots,\" wrote archaeologist Arthur Lillie in India in \nPrimitive Christianity (London: K. Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1909). Historian D. P. Singhal \nwrites in India and World Civilization (Michigan State University Press, 1969): \"Numer-\nous authorities, such as Hilgenfeld and Renan, maintain that there was Buddhist influence \non the Essene doctrines. And it was through this Jewish sect that Buddhist influences \nreached Palestine and later filtered through to Christianity....The life led by the Essenes,\" \nhe says (quoting historian Sir Charles Eliot in Hinduism and Buddhism: An \nHistorical \nSketch) \"was 'just as might have been evolved by seekers after truth who were trying to \nput into practice in another country the religious ideals of India.'\" (Publisher's Note) \n100 \n"}

Without this partitioning, no actor on the stage of life \nwould be able to cope with his kaleidoscopic identity and its relation-\nships with others, and with his place in the karmic cause-and-effect \nevents whirling around him—a dizzying conflict of countless incar-\nnations with their interpersonal relationships branching off into their \nown limitless previous existences and experiences. By wiping clean the \nmemory slate of each new lifetime, there is a freshness and a degree of \nprogressive order maintained in the cosmic drama. \nThe Hindu scriptures refer to creation as God's lila, a delusive \nphantasmagoria for man's entertainment through interaction with the \nworkings of the Cosmic Creator. Without a perception of believabil-\nity in each actor's part, the drama would soon lose its charm and come \nto a close. Thus even those of high spiritual estate accept the \"reality\" \nof their present position, dissociated outwardly from identity with \ntheir previous roles lest their overlay unduly influence and character-\nize their new dramatic portrayal. God-realized and liberated souls can \nwell remember previous enactments if they choose to do so; but for \nthe effectiveness of the earthly theatrics, they fully submit themselves \nto God's direction for their part in an unfolding new scene. This is in \nevidence in the following verses concerning the statement of John the \nBaptist about his identity: \nAnd this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and \nLevites from Jerusalem to ask him, \"Who art thou?\" \nAnd he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, \"I am not \nthe Christ.\" \nAnd they asked him, \"What then?

With what artless humility, the hallmark of godliness, \nJohn had set aside his former preeminence — declaring himself un-\nworthy to baptize Jesus, and that he himself rather \nGuru-disciple relation- \nhad need to be baptized. Certainly Jesus, a master, \nship: the way of \"all \nwas far above the need for ritualistic baptism, es-\nrighteousness\" \npecially by anyone of far lesser spiritual stature. A \ndoctor of philosophy does not take lessons from a \nchild engaged in elementary studies.

Jesus came to John for that spiritual \nanointing, an avowal of reverence for his guru from whom he had re-\nceived \"a double portion of Spirit\" in their incarnations as Elijah and \nElisha. \nThe relationship of guru and disciple is not for one incarnation \nonly. A guru, being the agent of salvation appointed by God, must \ntake the disciple through successive incarnations, if necessary, until \ncomplete liberation of the disciple is reached.

This is why Jesus said, \n\"Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteous-\nness.\" Though John and Jesus both knew that Jesus was far beyond \nthe need for this outer ritual, they were quite sincerely enacting the \nnecessary formalities in setting the right example for the world.* \nWords may be easily forgotten or distorted; the erudition of acts is far \nmore indelible. \nJohn's declaration to the priests and Levites, \"I indeed baptize you \nwith water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me...shall bap-\ntize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire,\" introduces a doctrine \ncrucial to the attainment of salvation: that the real baptism consists of \nspiritual initiation bestowed by a true guru. Even though John said he \nbaptized the masses with water, he did not say he was incapable of \nbaptizing with Spirit, only that such initiation would be the preroga-\ntive of the Christ who by special dispensation would come to be their \nsavior, or guru. In fact, it was the true baptism of Spirit that was be-\nstowed on Jesus when, after immersion in the Jordan (purification by \nwater), \"the heavens were opened unto him.\" As John himself wit-\nnessed: \"I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it \nabode upon him\" (John 1:32). If John were an ordinary man, he \nwould not have seen the Spirit descending on Jesus. He himself was in \ntune with Spirit, but with unfeigned humbleness deflected attention \nfrom himself to the preeminence of Jesus. \nIt is by the grace of the guru that heavenly consciousness unfolds \nto the initiated disciple, revealing the light of the omniscient spiritual \neye, symbolized by the dove—through this medium one ascends from \n* \"Whatever a superior being does, inferior persons imitate.

Students who sought instruc-\nDifferent types of \ntion in the spiritual life from a holy man had first \nbaptism \nto purify their bodies by bathing, which in itself \nwas the beginning of cleansing the mind, by show-\ning proper respect to the teacher, and by interiorizing the thoughts in \nexpectation of the blessings and the value of the lessons to be received. \n\"Cleanliness is next to godliness\" is a worthwhile first lesson. Immer-\nsion in water opens the pores of the skin, letting out disturbing body \npoisons and calming and soothing the circulatory system. Water cools \nthe nerve endings and sends reports of calm sensations throughout the \nvital centers of the body, balancing evenly all the vital energies. \nLife came initially from energy, then from nebulae, then from wa-\nter. All seeds of life are irrevocably connected with water. Physical life \ncannot exist without it. One who bathes every day and meditates im-\nmediately thereafter will feel the power of \"baptism\" by water. To \nbathe with the consciousness of purification in a holy river or a lake, \nor other natural waters surrounded by God's scenic grandeur, is a vi-\nbrantly uplifting experience. \nWhile baptism by water as a sacred rite has its valid points, in-\ncluding the temporary cleansing of the mind, the ceremony, to be of \nlasting value, must be followed up with continued lessons in spiritual \nliving and God-contact. Otherwise, the mind begins to revert to its old \nhabits; their evils wear away the salutary effects of the baptismal rit-\nual. Unless wickedness is purged by meditation and constant spiritual \nvigilance and endeavor, the initiated simply remain possessed of the \nsame devils with a penchant for misbehavior. A story in India illus-\ntrates this point metaphorically: A saint said to his would-be disciple, \n\"Son, it is necessary to bathe in the Ganges to purify the mind from \nsin. The sins will leave you while you bathe, for they cannot tolerate \nthe holy waters. But take care, for they will wait in the trees skirting \nthe river; and as soon as you come out of the sacred influence of the \nholy waters, they will again try to jump on you.\" \n106 \n"}

The initiate thereafter should regularly baptize the \nself with Spirit by immersion of the consciousness in the wisdom, mag-\nnetism, and spiritual radiation of the Holy Ghost in meditation. \nAs the intent of baptism is to bring about an uplifting change in \nthe consciousness by some form of symbolic immersion, it is good to \nconsider how one can be \"baptized\" unknowingly by one's associates. \nThe would-be \"initiate\" should therefore be discriminatively aware of \nthe waters into which the consciousness is immersed. \nVibrations of other people can be received by an exchange of mag-\nnetism. One who comes near a holy person will be benefited; this is bap-\ntism by spiritual magnetism. The saint's thoughts and magnetic aura cast \nout a vibratory glow that changes the consciousness and brain cells of \nthose who come within range. All who visit or live on the same grounds \nwhere a master lives or has lived will automatically be transformed if \nthey are in tune.

Man is a microcosm of the universe: a combination \nof body, life force, and consciousness. His consciousness is a reflection of \nChrist Consciousness, his soul differentiated by his own personalized ego. \nHis life force is individualized cosmic energy. His body is condensed cos-\nmic energy, enlivened by specialized life energy.* Life force vibrating \ngrossly changes into electrons, atoms, molecules, and bodily flesh; life \nforce vibrating progressively finer becomes consciousness. In the human \nbeing, the body, life force, and consciousness—being three different rates \nof vibration—are held together by the nucleus of ego and its pure na-\nture, the soul. In order to free the soul, the Christ in man, from the lim-\nited threefold vibrations of the human body, life force, and conscious-\nness, the divine consciousness in man has first to be baptized or united \nwith the Holy Ghost, the original cosmic vibration of Aum, the Word, \nthe primal manifestation of God. Thence, the consciousness merges in the \nOmnipresent Christ immanent in creation and ascends to the transcen-\ndent Cosmic Consciousness, the Father.

First, when the teacher bestows \ninitiation, he sees the Light himself as he baptizes the disciple. Second, \nwhen the teacher sends that Light into the initiate, which the devotee \nmay or may not see himself, it remains a little while with its full vi-\nbratory power to effect a spiritual change in the devotee; but it is tem-\nporary.

But when, by \nself-mastery in meditation, the attention is focused \nsteadily on the center of divine perception at the point between the eye-\nbrows, the searchlights of life force and consciousness are reversed. \nWithdrawing from the senses, they reveal the light of the spiritual eye. \nAs one switch throws light into the two headlights of an auto-\nmobile, so the astral center of superconsciousness in the medulla \nthrows its current into the two physical eyes that behold the world of \nduality. But by deep concentration on the point between the two eyes, \nthe light of the medulla flowing into the two eyes can be made to con-\nverge into the one single spiritual eye in the forehead.

A bent spine during meditation offers real re-\nsistance to the process of reversing the life currents to flow upward to-\nwards the spiritual eye.

When we meet a \nfriend we have not seen for six months there is not one molecule in his face which was \nthere when we last saw him. But, thanks to his controlling L-field, the new molecules \nhave fallen into the old, familiar pattern and we can recognize his face. Until modern \ninstruments revealed the existence of the controlling L-fields, biologists were at a loss \nto explain how our bodies 'kept in shape' through ceaseless metabolism and changes \nof material.

The Christ Consciousness embodied in Jesus could \nbe realized only by awakening the astral centers of the spine, the \nstraight way of ascension by which the metaphysical Christ Con-\nsciousness in the body of Jesus could be intuitionally perceived. \nThe words of the prophet Isaiah, which were echoed by John the \nBaptist, show that both knew that the subjective Lord of Finite Vibra-\ntory Creation, or Christ Consciousness, could be welcomed into one's \nown consciousness only through the meditation-awakened straight \nhighway of the spine. Isaiah, John, the yogis, all know that to receive \nChrist Consciousness more than a simple physical contact with a \nChristlike person is necessary. One must know how to meditate—how \nto switch off the attention from the distractions of the senses, and how \nto keep the consciousness fixed on the altar of the spiritual eye where \nChrist Consciousness can be received in all its glory. \nJesus himself and his disciples were products of the intuitive om-\nniscience of ecstatic meditation and devotion, not results of intellec-\ntual theological seminaries. \nChurches today have digressed from the path of Self-realization, \npersonal experience of God and Christ.

The \nSelf-Realization Fellowship technique of meditation on Aum teaches \none to hear and locate these astral sounds. This aids the awakening of \nthe divine consciousness locked in the spinal centers, opening them to \n\"make straight\" the way of ascension to God-realization. \nAs the devotee concentrates on Aum, first by mentally chanting \nAum, and then by actually hearing that sound, his mind is diverted from \nthe physical sounds of matter outside his body to the circulatory and \nother sounds of the vibrating flesh.

Because of Satan's delusion, man fails to see the \ngodly event that death was meant to be—a promotion, a liberation \nfrom toilsome, imperfect earth-life to perfect, everlasting freedom in \nGod. Rather, the grief at being forced to depart the material play-\nground engenders a Satan-devised desire to come back. \nUltimately, however, Satan defeats his own purpose; for physical \npain and sorrow are also prods that at last cause matter-weary souls \nto seek their preordained freedom in God. \nEmancipation is hastened by playing the living drama of a perfect \nlife of health, abundance, and wisdom with a detached mental above-\nness. Satan-engendered dualities of pain and sorrow are greatly lessened \nby a strong mind that does not exacerbate suffering by fear or nervous \nimagination. That is, if one can remove the consciousness of sickness \nand not fear illness if it does come; and not crave health while suffering \nfrom ill health, this helps one to remember one's own soul, the tran-\nscendent Self that has never undergone the fluctuations of either sick-\nness or health, but has always been perfect.* If one can feel and know \nthat he is a child of God, and as such possesses everything, even as his \nFather God does—whether he be poor or rich—he can be free.

Of course, if one is stricken with ill health, \nfailure, or ignorance, this doesn't mean he should supinely continue in \nthat state.

When he returned \nfully to incarnate consciousness, he was renewed in spirit, but felt the \nhunger of his mortal body deprived of its accustomed nourishment. \nAs souls, individualized sparks of unconditioned Spirit, children \nof God are immortal, free from any dependence on materiality. The \ncells of flowers, plants, animals, and human beings were intended by \nGod to live recharged by Cosmic Energy and not by cruelly feeding on \none another. It is only when the soul is identified with the Satan-\ndesecrated human body that man feels the hunger of dependence on \nnature's store. The Cosmic Delusive Force has led body-conscious man \nto believe that without physical sustenance his existence would be ter-\nminated. In turning to earth-products for nourishment (breath and \n\"bread\"), man remains earthbound, forgetful of his true nature that \nlives solely by the Cosmic Energy and will of God. \nSatan wanted Jesus to forget his divine state of unconditioned \nexistence. He began to tempt the Christ Consciousness of Jesus by play-\ning upon the primal need of the human body to satisfy its hunger. Satan \nworked through the mind of Jesus, expressing a tempting proposition: \n\"Why don't you use your divine power to change stones into bread?\" \nJesus—being one with the Divine Intelligence that has vibrated It-\nself into solids, liquids, and gases, and is holding them in balance by \nmagnetic, electrical, and thermal laws—had the power to manipulate \nthose principles to convert stones into bread by changing their rate of \nelectronic vibration. But he recognized Satan's delusively plausible sug-\ngestion as a ruse to encourage the mortal habit of catering to the psy-\nchology of physical hunger, which in that instance would have been a \nbetrayal of the realization that as an immortal, he lived by God's In-\nfinite Energy. This does not mean that after this experience Jesus \nforeswore human sustenance. He partook of simple foods, and of \nfeasts prepared by loving hosts; but he did it as a God-man, and not \nas a deluded human subject to the body's habit of physical hunger. \nSo Jesus answered the metaphysical Satan with a great vibratory \nforce of thought within himself, refusing to misuse his divine powers: \n\"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth \n160 \n"}

To consciously experience this truth, as did Jesus, \nis to realize the eternal link between the human and divine, matter and \nconsciousness—the irrevocable oneness of the Self with the Creator. \nThe medulla oblongata at the base of the brain is the seat of life, \nformed from the seed cell, the original nucleus, entered by the soul at \nthe time of conception. Like radio waves, which are unseen but can be \ndrawn out of the ether by a receiving apparatus, vibrating life energy \nfrom the omnipresent cosmic source is continuously received through \nthe subtle astral center in the medulla. It is stored in the dynamo of \nastral power in the brain, whence it flows out through the medulla— \nit \"proceedeth out of the mouth of God\"—and is distributed through-\nout all the cells of the body. If that beam of energy were taken away, \nthe body would drop dead immediately. \nMan thinks he lives on \"bread\"—food, oxygen, and sunshine— \nbut these are nothing but condensed Cosmic Energy. Radiant energy \nfrom the sun feeds plants; the plants are eaten by animals and humans; \nand in turn the plants eat them when they die. Directly or indirectly, \nsolar energy is the primary physical source of life. When a person in-\ngests food, life energy in the body begins to work on digesting and me-\ntabolizing it, ultimately drawing the stored solar energy out of that \nfood to supply the body. So the scientists say that the cells of the body \noperate by energy radiated from the sun, released through the chemi-\ncal reaction of oxidation. The very construction of protoplasm is \nmade possible by this solar radiation, which gives off electric forces \nthat enliven the cells.

To eat for the maintenance of the body-temple produces \nself-control, long life, health, and happiness. \nThrough fasting and meditation, Jesus realized fully that hunger \nis a delusion connected with the law of change in the body, and can \nbe overcome—that one can live entirely by God's energy.

Still other saviors, such as Christ, serve the world both quan-\ntitatively and qualitatively. The qualitative task requires the endeavor \nof the disciple and the blessing and guidance of the master in a mu-\ntual relationship sanctified by God. Students are those who follow the \nmaster more or less superficially according to their pick-and-choose \ninclination. But the disciple is one who accepts wholly, with open heart \nand mind. He does not have to be coaxed, but follows through his \nown will and determination. He remains steadfast, dedicated, and de-\nvoted to the end, until he has found freedom in God. The Lord Christ \nand the Lord Krishna both had such disciples. \nGod-ordained gurus feel intuitively the spiritual vibrations of their \ndisciples, whether near or far; and when a guru mentally calls his dis-\nciples, they come, drawn by their soul attunement with the teacher, the \nchannel of divine grace appointed by God. \nIn his supportive role of assisting the mission of Jesus, John the Bap-\ntist turned many of his own followers toward Jesus—in particular, those \nwho had been disciples of Jesus in past lives. The first of these was An-\ndrew, brother of Simon Peter; and the other unnamed person of the \n\"two\" with John the Baptist has been logically proposed as being John \nthe Apostle himself, since his is the only Gospel that relates this episode. \nThese two devotees, on the commendation of John the Baptist, and re-\nsponding to their own inner devotional attraction, followed Jesus to his \nresidence, addressing him reverentially as Rabbi, or Master. \nThe word rabbi is a Jewish title of respect which means \"my Mas-\nter,\" a form of address recognizing one who is qualified to teach.

The widespread generic usage of \nmaster as a title (as also that of guru) to denote any ordinary teacher \nor mentor should not disrespectfully belie the proper usage: as an ap-\npellation for a God-knowing, divinely endowed guru. \nFrom the cradle to the grave to ascension in Spirit, the whole of \ncivilization is based on the passing down of knowledge from the \nlearned to the learning.

The level of attainment rises or falls with the aptitude of \nthe \"student\" and the qualification of the \"mentor.\" In no other field \nis this as true as in spirituality. In India, where religious doctrines are \nmelted in the crucible of testing experience to separate truth from \ndogma, the verdict is that the only sure way of finding God is to learn \nabout Him from one who knows Him. The Hindu scriptures say, \n\"When a spiritually blind novitiate is led by a blind teacher, then both \nare misled\"—an admonition voiced similarly by Jesus.* \nGod is The Master, ruler of the universe; and those who manifest \ntheir oneness with Him may also be honored as masters. A spiritual \nmaster is not a wielder of authority over others, but rather a master of \nhimself, fully self-possessed and controlled in body, speech, and mind, \nwith all his senses fully reined. He never allows himself to be compelled \nby temptation to do anything against his discrimination-guided will, un-\nlike those who think that freedom, or free will, is to do whatever entices \ntheir minds. A master is he who knows in what lies the best interest of \nhis true Self, the soul, and so never entertains evil in thought or deed. \nSelf-mastery is the citadel of wisdom. When the title of Master is \nused in addressing a personage of this stature, it signifies reverence for \nhim who knows truth offered by one who desires to have that knowl-\nedge conferred on himself by the guru. \nAndrew, after he and his companion had been with Jesus for a \nday, was so saturated with the spiritual magnetism emanating from \nJesus that he understood who Jesus was, recogniz-\ning him as the Christ. The Christ Consciousness \ncannot be intellectually inferred, but has to come \nthrough intuitional awareness. God-ordained gurus \ndo not have to convert their inner circle of disciples \nby soapbox preaching; they communicate primarily \nby the silent emanation of the vibrations of their God-realization. My \nMaster drew me that way when I first saw him, without introduction, \nin a busy market lane in Banaras.

They feel a connection of oneness \nat first sight in their exchange of magnetism. \nThe sum total of a person is expressed in his magnetism. His very \nbeing, in fact, has its origin in magnetism—in the creative ideational \npowers of man's causal body, the God-ideas that form man's astral and \nphysical bodies and sustain the soul's incarnation. Through the medulla \noblongata, Cosmic Consciousness and Cosmic Energy enter into the \nsubtle astral cerebrospinal centers of life and consciousness, and thence \ninto the physical body, as positive and negative currents, forming a se-\nries of attracting magnets. Each individual is a bundle of these magnets, \nwith attracting power according to their magnetic strength. Jesus was \na Christ magnet empowering him to attract multitudes, as compared \nwith the ordinary man who can attract very little. \nAll the parts of the body that come in pairs—eyes, ears, tongue \nand the little uvula tongue, hands, feet, and so on—have their posi-\ntive and negative sides. They receive and radiate positive and negative \nlifetronic currents, each pair forming a magnet. The optical magnet \ncan charm, enthrall, and strongly draw people; they will feel the mag-\nnetism of the soul of that person through his eyes. Some highly devel-\noped persons are able to spiritualize or heal others, even a whole au-\ndience, just by the magnetism of the eyes. \nThe spiritual practice of \"laying on of hands\" to send healing rays \ninto the body of a patient electrocutes the germs and other agents of dis-\nease. There is tremendous power in the life force flowing through the \nhands, provided it is made strong by a pure, indomitable will. A will \nthat refuses to be discouraged by anything, and that flows continually \nand energetically toward accomplishment of its object, becomes divinely \nempowered. The strong will of man guided by wisdom is Divine Will. \nAs each person carries with him a telltale silent evidence of his \nown vibrations, individuals residing in the same house, sharing the \nsame rooms, soon come to know each other, even if they verbally \ncommunicate very little, because of an exchange of the magnetic vi-\nbrations of their consciousness, nature, vitality, and feelings.

The eyes of saints in ecstatic communion are always upturned, \nlocked in that center of divine perception. \nBy the right method of meditation and devotion, with the eyes \nclosed and concentrated on the spiritual eye, the devotee knocks at the \ngates of heaven.f When the eyes are focused and still, and the breath \nand mind are calm, a light begins to form in the forehead. Eventually, \nwith deep concentration, the tricolored light of the spiritual eye be-\ncomes visible. Just seeing the single eye is not enough; it is more diffi-\ncult for the devotee to go into that light. But by practice of the higher \nmethods, such as Kriya Yoga, the consciousness is led inside the spir-\nitual eye, into another world of vaster dimensions. \nIn the gold halo of the spiritual eye, all creation is perceived as the \nvibratory light of the Holy Ghost. The blue light of Christ Conscious-\nness is where the angels and deity agents of God's individualized pow-\n* Yoga explains that the two physical eyes are an externalization of the finer forces in \nthe single spiritual eye of the astral body.

In deep meditation, when the gaze \nof the two eyes is concentrated at the point between the eyebrows, the dual positive \nand negative currents flowing from the medulla into the two eyes reunite, and the med-\nitator beholds the \"single\" or spiritual eye. \nModern scientific evidence that our two eyes begin as a single structure is found \nin the research of molecular neurobiologist Yi Rao of the Washington University \nSchool of Medicine, reported in Discover, \nMay 1997. Dr. Rao studied eye develop-\nment in frog embryos and isolated the so-called \"Cyclops\" gene, which may control \neye development. By the time the embryo is twenty-one hours old, the two dark spots \nthat later form into the eyes are visible. Dr. Rao found that these two spots had orig-\ninated as a single band. His experiments demonstrated that if the brain does not sig-\nnal cells in this \"single band\" to shut down and allow two separate eyes to form \n(which happens in normal development), one-eyed tadpoles are the result.

If the neutron did not outweigh the proton in the \nnucleus of the atoms, the active lifetime of the Sun and other stars would be reduced \nto a few hundred years; if the electric charge of electrons and protons did not balance \nprecisely, all configurations of matter would be unstable and the universe would con-\nsist of nothing more than radiation and a relatively uniform mixture of gases....If the \nstrong force that binds the particles of a nucleus were merely a fraction weaker than \nit is, deuteron could not exist and stars such as the Sun could not shine. And if that \nforce were slightly stronger than it is, the Sun and other active stars would inflate and \nperhaps explode....The values of the four universal forces [electromagnetism, gravity, \nand the nuclear strong and weak forces] were precisely such that life could evolve in \nthe cosmos.\" \nNotes Professor Davies: \"Quite a list of 'lucky accidents' and 'coincidences' has \nbeen compiled....For a recent review see Cosmic Coincidences \nby John Gribbin and \nMartin Rees (New York: Bantam, 1989).\" Davies estimates that if—as some scientists \nmaintain—there were no inherent guiding intelligence and cosmic evolution were gov-\nerned only by the chance operation of strictly mechanical laws, \"the time required to \nachieve the level of order we now meet in the universe purely by random processes is \nof the order of at least 10loSO years\" — inconceivably longer than the current age of the \nuniverse.

They are suf-\nficiently differentiated to be classified, yet not as rigidly differentiated \nas objectified matter. Thoughts of fear, of joy, of hunger, of ambition \n—all these are different; yet they are interrelated inasmuch as they are \nall manifestations of the same consciousness. Every phase of thought \ntouches other thoughts in an interchange of communication. \nMatter is vibration that gives the idea of the want of interrelation. \nMatter can be divided or classified in different ways without interre-\nlation; that is, each object has its own distinct fixity. You can divide a \npiece of cake and place it in two rooms without interrelation, but our \nthoughts of today and tomorrow are interrelated and are conscious of \neach other. The objectified consciousness of matter cannot think of it-\nself, or of its interrelation with other matter. It is fixed consciousness, \ninstinct-bound. What is instinct-bound?

Finite ob-\nwork of Dr. David Bohm, late professor of physics at the University of London, has \nprovided \"an entirely new way of understanding the fundamental nature of the phys-\nical universe, as glimpsed through the data and laws of physics,\" writes Will Keepin, \nPh.D., in \"Lifework of David Bohm: River of Truth\" (ReVision \nmagazine, Summer \n1993). \"Prior to Bohm, science had generally regarded the universe as a vast multitude \nof separate interacting particles. Bohm offers an altogether new view of reality....'un-\nbroken wholeness in flowing movement.' What is remarkable about Bohm's hypothe-\nsis is that it is also consistent with spiritual wisdom down through the ages.\" \nIn quantum physics, the notion of matter being composed of definite particles has \nnow been superseded by the discovery of an all-pervading \"field\" of powerful invisi-\nble forces. This discovery, writes K. C. Cole in The Hole in the Universe: How \nScien-\ntists Peered Over the Edge of Emptiness and Found Everything \n(New York: Harcourt, \n2001), showed that \"particles of matter were in themselves rather irrelevant; they were \nonly the spigots through which various forces flowed. A solid object, if you like, was \nsomething like a fountain composed of intersecting cascades of water, all flowing from \ntiny pointlike orifices. The 'real' stuff of matter was the flowing water, or forces.\" \n\"The concept of field,\" Cole explains, \"was a huge revolution in thought that re-\nmains completely unknown to most laypeople....[But] Einstein called the 'change in \nconception of reality' from particles and empty space to fields 'the most profound and \nfruitful one that has come to physics since Newton.'...Matter, in this view, is simply a \nplace where some of the field happens to be concentrated. Matter condenses out of \nfield like water droplets condense out of water vapor in a steamy bathroom. Particles \nof matter are concentrations of field that travel through the field like ripples in a rope \nor a wave in water. The essential 'stuff'—that is to say, the rope or the water—does \nnot travel from place to place. Only the kink travels.... \n\"This view of matter explains, among other things, why every electron in the uni-\nverse is exactly the same as every other electron, every top quark the same as every \nother top quark. A particle doesn't really exist in its own right. It is only a particular \nmanifestation of a field. And globally speaking, the field is everywhere the same.\" \nProfessor N. C. Panda, Ph.D., sums up the implications in Maya in Physics (Delhi: \nMotilal Banarsidass, 1991): \"Science has discarded the concept of pluralism and has \naccepted field or space as one and a single continuous entity as the basis of the ap-\npearance of the multifarious world. This basic entity is one and continuous; it is the \nsource of the heterogenous manifestation of the universe. The one gives rise to many; \nthe invisible gives rise to multifarious invisible-cum-visible ones; the formless gives rise \nto pluralities of forms.

Meru is the loftiest of mythological mountains; and danda, \"a rod, \na staff,\" is representative of the spine with its spiritual centers, the crest of which is re-\nferred to as the holy Meru, the highest center of divine consciousness.

In Gnosis: A Selection of Gnostic Texts (Ox-\nford, England: Clarendon Press, 1972), German scholar Werner Foerster quotes Ire-\nnaeus as saying: \"Basilides presents Nous originating first from the unoriginate Fa-\nther.\" Valentinus, a teacher greatly respected by the Christian congregation in Rome \naround A.D. 140, held similar views, according to Foerster, believing that \"in the Pro-\nlogue to the Gospel of John, the 'Only-begotten' takes the place of \nNous.\" \nAt the Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325), however, and at the later Council of Con-\nstantinople (A.D. 381) the church proclaimed as official doctrine that Jesus himself was, \nin the words of the Nicene Creed, \"the only begotten Son of God, begotten from the \nFather before all ages, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made, \nhomoousios \n['of one substance'] with the Father.\" After the Council of Constantino-\nple, writes Timothy D. Barnes in Athanasius and Constantius: \nTheology and Politics \nin the Constantinian Empire (Harvard University Press, 1993), \"the emperor enshrined \nits decisions in law, and he subjected Christians who did not accept the creed of Nicaea \nand its watchword homoousios to legal disabilities. As has long been recognized, these \nevents marked the transition from one distinctive epoch in the history of the Christian \nchurch and the Roman Empire to another.\" From that point on, explains Richard E. \nRubenstein in When Jesus Became God: The Struggle to Define Christianity \nDuring \nthe Last Days of Rome (New York: Harcourt, 1999), the official teaching of the church \nwas that to not accept Jesus as God was to reject God Himself. Through the centuries, \nthis view had enormous and often tragic implications for the relationship between \nChristians and Jews (and later, Muslims, who regarded Jesus as a divine prophet but \nnot as part of the Godhead), as well as for the non-Christian peoples in the lands later \nconquered and colonized by European nations.

The secondary concern is to care for the body only as nec-\nessary to maintain it as a fit instrument. \nOrdinary food temporarily nourishes the perishable body and \ngives it a passing pleasure arising from the sense of taste. But even if a \nperson were to sate himself with any and all food he desired, still his \nhunger would burn; man cannot appease the hunger of the soul by sat-\nisfying the desires of the body. Jesus was telling his disciples that al-\nthough they had brought food for his human body—the token need \nfor which he did not deny—his real Self tasted the ever-satisfying, eter-\nnally nourishing manna of Divine Wisdom and celestial ever-new Bliss. \nThe disciples had been drawn to Jesus that they might learn how \nto nourish their souls. So Jesus spoke to them of the supremely sus-\ntaining \"meat\" of wisdom. When man is not guided by wisdom, ma-\nterial food does not even sustain the body: By wrong dietary choices \nor overeating people may forfeit their physical health and comfort. \n* Matthew 4:4 (see Discourse 8). \n318 \n"}

In spiritual homes \nin India, the first thought in the morning is of drinking the nectar of \npeace from the bowl of deep contemplation; and at night, before retir-\ning, they sit quietly in meditation to hear the voice of Divine Peace \nsinging softly, inviting them to rest on the bosom of Divine Peace. \nAs long as one is identified with the body, he is tempted to seek \nhappiness in fulfilling its desires and appetites. He dreams of being a \nmillionaire, of having a luxurious home, expensive cars, and the best \nmeals money can buy. However, even a cursory observation of those \nwho have these things dispels their illusory sufficiency. Material sur-\nfeit attracts swarming pests of worry, restlessness, boredom, psycho-\nlogical and spiritual dissatisfaction. Upon wakening in the morning, \nand at night before going to sleep, and at mealtime, people should rid \ntheir consciousness of the material pestilence with the thought of God. \nSeeking in deep meditation to become attuned to God's will en-\nables one to be in the world but not of the world. To remain unat-\ntached, like the dewdrop on the lotus leaf, is to be really happy, ready \nto slip the consciousness into God. As a dewdrop \ncannot slide on blotting paper, so the mind of the \nBecome attuned to \naverage person cannot readily slide into thoughts of \nGod's will: in the \nGod if it is absorbed in an inner environment of \nworld but not of the \nearthly desires or an outer environment of materi- \nworld \nally minded companions. \nThe way to remain spiritually free and nonattached is to realize \nthat this earth belongs solely to God. All of man's so-called posses-\nsions are loaned to him only that he may play a role in this colossal \ndrama of life. None of the props belongs to man, not even his body, \nwhich is but a temporary costume that must be surrendered when his \nparticular part in the drama is over and God calls him behind the cur-\ntain of death. Until man's histrionics are finished, happiness lies in per-\nfecting his performance, without personal attachment, according to \nthe promptings of the Divine Director. The will of God is to plan for \nevery actor the best finale; in that lies the true joy of living. \nThus Jesus said that as food is the pleasurable sustenance that \nman depends on for life, so the relish that supported the vitality of his \nlife consisted in doing the will of God—cheerfully, willingly, not like \n319 \n"}

Cheerful cooperation with God's will is the secret of a dy-\nnamic existence, charging body and mind with divine life. Man is \nmade of the blissful consciousness of God, and lives by that Con-\nsciousness. The more cheerful a person is, the more his positive \nthoughts draw vitality into his body cells from the abundance of Di-\nvine Consciousness. One who allows the episodes of life to make his \nmind habitually cross and moody finds his bodily energies depressed \naccordingly, no matter how much or what type of food he eats. That \nis why Jesus emphasized to his disciples that the consciousness of man \nshould not be predominantly on a material diet, but on the nourish-\nment of divine wisdom. That wisdom which feeds man's body with vi-\ntality, his mind with invulnerability, and his soul with celestial bliss is \nto do the will of God. \nAs prophets are sent on earth to fill a world need according to the \nLord's cosmic plan, Jesus knew the stupendous mission he had to per-\nform, and the possible consequences that could come to him as a re-\nsult of his actions. Yet he was sustained in the peace and joy of his \ncommitment \"to do the will of Him that sent me.\" \"To finish His \nwork\" signifies finishing, in the short span that was left to him, the \nGod-given task that was his part to carry out during his incarnation \nas Jesus—not the completion of the work of redemption, which God \nand His avatars have to carry on throughout eternity. \nEvery human being has a unique part in the drama of life, des-\ntined according to that individual's self-created karmic pattern.

How may one even know the will of God as to what one \nshould do? So many have told me that they are divinely guided; but I \nknow they are not, because I see they have not even communed with \nGod. So how could they be guided by Him? I try to warn them; but \nwhen they are immovably fixed in the delusion that they know God's \nwill, I have then to remain silent and watch the ego make a mess of \ntheir determinations. It is often a sad spectacle. \nOf course, through prayer and meditation and faith one does get \nsome inner spiritual sense of direction. No one should be without this \nattunement. But to be consciously guided by God, rather than by the \nmanipulative rationalizations of one's desires or whims or habits, is \nanother matter, of deeper realization. For most people, the will of God \nis best understood through a God-sent guru. Guru is one who knows \nGod, and who shows the way to Him. To follow a divine manifesta-\ntion is the sure way to God-realization. One who knows God becomes \nthe speaking voice of the silent God. Attunement with the wisdom-\nguided will of a true guru teaches one how to guide his will according \nto God's will. Those who follow the voice of their own ego, ascribing \nto it a halo of divine guidance, find out too late that no amount of de-\nluded rationalization will relieve one of the karmic responsibility of \nwrong actions. To be led by an ego-bound will is to stumble into \npainful delusive entanglements. Do not remain entangled! Be free! \nThe will of God is to free every soul. Man's part is to cooperate \nwith that purpose by living in harmony with God's laws as defined by \na God-realized guru. Man thereby learns his destined purpose and un-\nderstands what God wants him to do with his life. Acting accordingly, \nhe \"finishes God's work\" that is his unique assignment on the stage of \nincarnation. With Christ, he ingests the \"meat\" of wisdom and be-\ncomes an instrument in fulfilling the Divine Will. \n\"Say not ye, 'There are yet four months, and then cometh har-\nvest' ?

And \nherein is that saying true, 'One soweth, and another reapeth.' I \nsent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men \nlaboured, and ye are entered into their labours\" (John 4:35-3 8). \nM\nortal life is governed by the law of karma: \"As you sow, so \nshall you reap.\" In this passage, however, Jesus used the para-\nble of the sower, the laborer, the harvesting time, and the harvest to il-\nlustrate that the immortal soul of man, a reflection of transcendent \nSpirit, is above creation's cause-and-effect subjugation. To one who is \nidentified with his assumed mortal nature, the karmic law metes out \nwisdom and happiness only according to one's earned merit. One who \nis identified with Spirit reaps without measure the infinite wealth of \nDivinity. \nThus did Jesus elucidate the superior law of the Divine Harvest: In \nordinary farming there is a great deal of labor, and the harvest comes in \n—— \nabout four months after planting; but Jesus said that \nThe soul needs noth- \nreaping divine abundance is not a matter of laboring, \ning but to remember \nwaiting, and finally acquiring the spiritual harvest. \nthe divine wealth it al- \nThe soul need acquire nothing. As a child of God, it \nready possesses \nneeds only to remember what it already possesses in \nlatent form: its infinite wisdom-inheritance from the \nDivine Father. The moment man's consciousness transcends body iden-\ntification into Self-realization, the soul's contact with God becomes \nmanifest, its God-essence revealed from beneath the wisdom-seared veil \nof ignorance.* \nHuman wisdom has to be cultivated gradually through the instru-\nmentality of the senses and rational intelligence; but the measureless \nharvest of divine wisdom can be reaped instantaneously through the \nmedium of intuition, developed by meditation. Jesus exhorted his fol-\nlowers, \"Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields,\" for all one has to \ndo is to lift the consciousness from the plain of material vibrations to \nthe ever-ready harvest of wisdom, glistening on the pure white fields of \nCosmic Consciousness. The two physical eyes see only material Nature. \n* \"As enkindled flame converts firewood into ashes, so does the fire of wisdom con-\nsume to ashes all karma.

This is a great consolation, for to reach perfection \nthrough the karmic consequential process of trial and error seems a \nnear impossibility, requiring countless incarnations. Man must labor \nto acquire prosperity, wisdom, and happiness; a Self-realized child of \nGod, reclaiming his divine inheritance, already possesses everything. \nSo much effort is required to reap a harvest of material worth— \na relative waste of time when one must inevitably lose, sooner or later, \nall that has been acquired. Jesus points out that it is far better to make \nthe effort to know what one already possesses as a divine child. The \nsoul that has cast off its mortality claims its birthright and enjoys \nthroughout eternity the harvest of Bliss in God. \nMaterial habits and indolence cause many otherwise spiritually \ninclined persons to say: \"Well, it takes prodigious effort to be spiri-\ntual.\" I say: \"No.\" The only effort we have to make is to forget our \nunspiritual mortal consciousness; as soon as that is done, we know we \nare gods. \"He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto \nlife eternal.\" He who reaps soul knowledge through meditation re-\nceives the wages of Divine Wisdom, and gathers the resultant fruits of \nimmortal, ever new Bliss. \n\"That both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice to-\ngether\" signifies that God, as the Sower of Wisdom in souls, is pleased \nwhen He finds that His true children reap the harvest grown by Him, \nand not the harvest of evil sown and reaped by mortal ignorance. \n\"One soweth and another reapeth\" can be interpreted on two lev-\nels of meaning: first, as relating to the harvest in man's soul; and sec-\nond, as relating to man's influence on his fellow beings in the world. \nPrimarily, Jesus' words signify that God is the Sower, the sole \nSource, of wisdom, and that His children have only to reap what He \nhas already grown for them in their souls. God sent human beings on \nearth to reap the soul harvest of wisdom and bliss, for which no hu-\nman effort was made.

For all people to become in this lifetime as rich \nas a Henry Ford would be impossible, because of the limitations of \nearthly existence. But every human being has the potential to become \nChristlike in one life by proper meditation, because all are already \nsons of God, made in His image. By meditation and calmness, man \nopens his agelong closed eyes of wisdom. The light of awakening ac-\ntualizes his latent potentials, and he finds himself one with the Owner \nof the entire cosmos. \nThe fruits of one's spiritual awakening are a blessing not only on \none's own life, but on the world at large. This is the second meaning of \n• \n\"one soweth and another reapeth\": a reference to \nHuman life is affected \nmass karma.

If a person writes a \ndegrading novel, all who read it reap the evil effects of the author's \nthoughts. The law of cause and effect operates in even subtler ways as \nwell. The actions of each individual leave electromagnetic etchings in \nhis brain, influencing his future actions; and they also leave vibrational \ntraces in the ether, which register in and influence the minds of others. \nIn Mysore I visited a sandalwood factory; each piece and shaving \nof sandalwood contributes to the atmosphere of the whole place, and \nanyone who enters enjoys the wonderful fragrance. Similarly, when I \ncome to our Self-Realization Fellowship temples, there are so many \ngood souls earnestly seeking God that I feel the spiritual vibration em-\nanating from their collective goodness. Conversely, a gathering of per-\nsons given to drinking and rowdyism would produce a strong nega-\ntive atmosphere. \nThe overall quality and character of any community, any civiliza-\ntion, is produced by mass karma, the accumulated effects of actions \nleft in the ether by the populace in general. Each individual is respon-\nsible for contributing to the mass karma, which in turn influences \nevery individual. \n324 \n"}

Thus, individual effort can be \neven more important than mass karma. One who in every way tries to \nuplift himself, harmonizing body, mind, and soul with the Divine, cre-\nates positive karma not only in his own life, but in his family, neigh-\nborhood, country, and world. Hence it is not justified to say, \"Thou-\nsands of people are misbehaving, so what does it matter if I am, too?\" \nNo!

Thus, when asked by the nobleman to heal his son who was \ndying at Capernaum, Jesus observed wryly: \"Except ye see signs and \nwonders, ye will not believe.\" It was a gentle rebuke: \"You are loath to \nbelieve in God's message of salvation sent through me unless He first \ndemonstrates His presence in me by a display of miracles that benefits \nprimarily your temporal needs.\" God should not have to prove Himself \nthrough miracles to earn the love and trust of His children. Each one, \nthrough his own free will and perfect accord, should make a voluntary \nchoice of the heart to love God and to seek to know Him. In the wis-\ndom of a master, one should recognize the Divine Presence and be in-\nspired toward God-realization without the impetus of supernatural \ndemonstrations. Nevertheless, seeing that the nobleman's faith was sin-\ncere, Jesus sympathetically told him: \"Go thy way; thy son liveth.\" \nThese few words, supported neither by persuasive eloquence nor \nobvious evidence, were yet sufficient to satisfy the nobleman; he could \nsense the divine vibration of healing power in Jesus. Thus, \"he believed \nthe word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.\" \nAnd as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told \nhim, saying, \"Thy son liveth.\" \nThen enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. \nAnd they said unto him, \"Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever \nleft him.\" \nSo the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which \nJesus said unto him, \"Thy son liveth\": and himself believed, and \nhis whole house. \nThis is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was \ncome out of Judea into Galilee (John \n4:51-54). \nH P he \nmany instantaneous physical healings wrought by Jesus were \ni L accomplished through his knowledge of the same scientific law \nby which he had earlier changed water into wine: the relationship of \nthought, life energy, and matter.

Thought \nis thus the brain, the architect, of the cells and units of life force in every \nparticle of bodily tissue, influencing the functions of the underlying in-\ntelligent lifetrons. Hence, disease thoughts can upset the entire govern-\nment of the life force in the cells; if strong enough or chronic enough, \nsuch thoughts manifest as bodily disease.

Instead of intellectualizing the delusive nature of the \nbody, one should make the effort to realize how thought condenses into \nenergy, and energy into flesh and blood and tissue. Neither fanatic fancy \nnor dogmatic belief bestows this realization; it comes by tuning in with \nGod through some technique of awakening His consciousness in the \nsoul. In this state of enlightenment, one fully realizes that the physical \nbody and the entire cosmos are but frozen dreams of the Creator; and \nthat our consciousness, an individualization of His consciousness, is the \nperceiver of and participator in His creative activity. Flowing water di-\nrected over an iceberg sculpts the berg into a new shape, either melting \nit partially or adding to its substance by becoming frozen itself. Like-\nwise, a powerful mind and will can make consciousness interact with \nfrozen consciousness to manipulate it for good or for ill. \nThe life force in the body has the absolute power to construct or de-\nstroy the body. But the life force can only perform according to the will \nof the bodily owner.

If for fifty years a person has enjoyed \nhealth, he thinks he can never be sick. If he suddenly finds himself phys-\nically ill, he thinks at first he will get well; but if the disease persists for \nsix months, he becomes convinced that he will never get well. It is a re-\ngrettable psychological error to allow oneself to be manipulated by neg-\native thoughts.

If the strong mind of a healer \ncan revive the will of the patient who has become paralyzed with the \nconsciousness of sickness, then the patient can change his thought and \nenergy, and thus heal himself.

A God-realized \nmaster can produce healing in an unresponsive person, but it is much \nmore difficult; and only a master would be aware of the karmic cir-\ncumstances that would make such a healing possible. \nThe power of thought in the healing of disease sets into motion a \nwhole metaphysical process cooperative with the laws of creation that \nbring matter into manifestation.

These proteins sup-\nposedly are able to both build the body and to switch on and off all the chemical \nprocesses inside the cell which ultimately control the running of the body.\" Where this \nexplanation leaves a gap, McTaggart reports, \"is in explaining exactly how DNA knows \nwhen to orchestrate this.... \n\"When a fertilized egg starts to multiply and produce daughter cells, each begins \nadopting a structure and function according to its eventual role in the body. Although \nevery daughter contains the same chromosomes with the same genetic information, cer-\ntain types of cells immediately 'know' to use different genetic information to behave \ndifferently from others....Furthermore, somehow these genes know how many of each \ntype of cell must be produced in the right place....At the moment, scientists shrug their \nshoulders as to how this might all be accomplished, particularly at such a rapid pace.\" \nLaszlo continues: \"For example, while the molecular anatomy of a human hand is \nunderstood in some detail, almost nothing is known about how the human organism \ninstructs itself to build a hand. It appears that the organism can both build, and to \nsome extent rebuild, its damaged parts with great precision. For example, when a fin-\nger of the human hand is amputated above the first joint and the wound is not sealed \nsurgically with skin, the tip of the finger can be regenerated. Astonishingly enough, the \nregrown fingertip is complete down to the finest detail, reproducing even the individ-\nual's unique fingerprints.\" \nFingerprints, known to biologists and criminologists alike as mathematically \nunique to one individual, are apparently not produced by genetic instructions from \nDNA, since it has been thoroughly documented that even identical twins—who share \nthe exact same DNA—have different fingerprints. What this suggests, according to sci-\nentists like Harold S. Burr, is that the growth and maintenance of the body depends on \nsome organizing template of subtle intelligent energy that possesses characteristics \nunique to each individual and that guides the development and functioning of each \nphysical body.

The opportune occasion came at the Sea of Galilee. As he \nstood at the water's edge, throngs pressed upon Jesus to hear his \ngospel and receive his blessing. He boarded a fishing boat, moored on \nland belonging to Simon (Peter) and his brother Andrew, and asked \nSimon to move the vessel a little offshore, from which vantage place \nhe taught the people. \nAfterward, he instructed Simon: \"Launch out into the deep, and \nlet down your nets for a draught.\" Simon obeyed, even while he \nprotested the futility in that no fishes had been hauled aboard though \nthey had labored all night. With Jesus' silent intervention, however, so \nmany fishes filled Simon's net that it broke. The partners of Simon and \nAndrew, the brothers James and John, were called to launch their boat \nfrom shore to help with the catch. Both ships became so laden they \nbegan to sink—an abundant contradiction to Simon's assertion that \nthere were no fish to be had. \nJesus wanted to demonstrate to Simon the bountifulness of God \nto those who trust in Him, and to show that even the fish obeyed the \nDivine Command. Andrew, James, and John were \nFishing \nfor souls \nin \nastonished at the surfeit of fishes. And at this sign \nthe ocean \nof delusion \nfrom God, Simon Peter bowed down in humble \ncontrition before Jesus, repenting of his sins and \nlack of faith.

May I learn how to cast the net of truth over \nsoul-fishes roaming in the fetid waters of delusion, to release them in \nthe immortalizing sea of God-wisdom.\" \nWise men consider this world an ocean of delusion in which hu-\nman fish are constantly chased by the sharks of the senses. Satan then \ncasts upon these piscine mortals his colossal dragnet of entangling de-\nsires, and is pulling his catch to the shores of destruction. God wants \ntrue fishers of men to learn the art of casting the net of personal spir-\nitual magnetism to catch error-bound souls and bring them to Him. \nThose who are brought with wisdom into God's presence are ever pro-\ntected in the clear waters of immortality. \nWhen, through the help of wise men, souls are transferred from \nthe brine of material desires to the sweet waters of Bliss, they bring re-\njoicing to the august Giver of Life.

Material or mental help is only transitory \nconsolation for human embroilments; Heaven is the permanent pana-\ncea for all human afflictions. \nThe givers of food and mental power enrich themselves tem-\nporarily by the goodwill of those benefited; but the givers of soul nour-\nishment benefit themselves throughout eternity, as also the receivers of \nthe divine manna. The effect of food and mental power more or less \nwears off in time unless constantly replenished, but the marks of soul \nwisdom impinged upon the inner being can seldom be erased. That is \nwhy Jesus began to call qualified disciples from their natural labors to \nassist him in drawing souls from the waters of delusion into the ever-\nliving wisdom of God's oceanic presence. \nTo be a good fisherman, one must learn the tools and skills of the \ntrade. In order to become a spiritual fisherman, one must become \nadept in the art of spiritual fishing. To give salvation to others with-\nout having it oneself is impossible. No matter how well-meaning, a \nperson can give only what he has, nothing else. In order to give spiri-\ntual power, one must first acquire that power himself. Just as a gift of \nfood presupposes its possession by the giver, so also, wisdom can only \nbe conferred upon others by those who possess it. Enlightenment can \nbe imparted only by one who himself reflects that inner light. \nJesus knew this requisite, that anyone willing to be a fisher of \nsouls must intensely spiritualize himself first. He voiced this quite \nplainly in the Sermon on the Mount: \"Thou hypocrite, cast out first \nthe beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull \nout the mote that is in thy brother's eye.\" \nA fisher of men must save himself from the ocean of ignorance by \nsincerely offering himself unto God with constant effort and vigilance. \nThe Heavenly Father wants to see His fishers of men escape from Sa-\ntan's nets of delusion and destruction so that they can help other en-\ntrapped souls. To seek one's own salvation and then not use it to ben-\nefit others is extreme selfishness.

It is nature's quixotic teasing of man that strenuous self-control \nproduces ultimate happiness, and the effortlessness of momentarily \npleasurable indulgence brings eventual unhappiness. \nEvil, once established within man, is made so attractive that he \neasily inclines toward evil actions, evil habits, and evil tendencies. Dis-\ncriminating souls who have compared the results of evil experiences \nwith the outcome of righteous behavior have inevitably concluded that \nevil, though ever so appealing in the beginning, is really a loathsome \nharbinger of acute suffering, while virtue, though initially difficult to \npursue, is the ambassador of invariable ultimate good. \nHysterical moralists decry evil as an ugly, vile abomination to be \nsummarily discarded. But when some of their followers taste the in-\ntoxicating comfort of temptation, it seems neither ugly nor vile; they \ndismiss the fear of evil consequences and embrace the freely given mo-\nmentary pleasure. Long afterward—or sometimes in the resounding \ncrash of instancy—the mask of attractiveness falls off, and the satanic \nnature of evil appears with its consequential ravages. \nIt is not enough to preach against evil, for its deceptive cunning \nwill counteract every argument.

If the inveterate smoker later accurately analyzes the \neffect of smoking on his health and mind and tries to forsake the habit, \nhe is hard put and often unsuccessful in doing so. Evil has a gripping \naffect. But so have virtuous ways. \nWhen evil arrives first and firmly establishes itself in a person's \nlife, it takes advantage of its priority and deludes its host with the con-\nsciousness of its supreme attractiveness. This blinds that person to the \nsuperior offerings of goodness and virtue. Many people are thus so \nsteeped in error that they enter the grave without ever realizing their \ndeluded state. Their evolution is delayed as they carry their progres-\nsion in evil into the next life, or several lives, until through the in-\nevitable effects of their wrongdoings they come to a rude awakening. \nSo, before evil mesmerizes one's mind with false expectations, the \npower of goodness should be cultured to become the in-charge of one's \nlife.

Spreading \nthe word of God should not be used as a medium for glorifying one's \nego and indulging its penchant for recognition. \nUntil I feel a disciple is true from the past, I would not ask him to \nteach.

He should know the difference between true religion and cus-\ntom, discriminating between universal spirituality and denominational \nobservances. \nIn order to transmit truth effectively, one must be inspired by the \ninner perception of truth. The highest type of spiritual teacher spends \nmuch time in the divine communion of prayer and meditation — \npreferably, every morning, noon, and night. This is the way to be able \nto arrive at the truth in any given situation. \nHe should believe in and be well versed in the truths he wants to \nteach, and then strive to realize those truths in himself. The intuitional \nteacher is the most qualified. The intuitive power of the soul, once \nawakened by meditation, does not have to depend on reason; it knows. \nA teacher should always meditate before instructing others, a \npractice more valuable than gleaning ideas from books or dialogues \nwith other people. \n389 \n"}

He wrote in The Marriage of \nEast and West (London: Collins, 1982): \"It cannot be too strongly affirmed that these \nare real powers which act on the unconscious...that is, on the lower levels of con-\nsciousness, bringing man into subjection to the powers of nature.

He sees God alone everywhere.* \nIn summary, the lesson to be drawn from the dramatic demon-\nstrations of Jesus in casting out devils is not that one should concen-\ntrate on and fear possession by tramp souls (a rare actuality) or ob-\nsessions by Satan's evil entities (innate in the human psyche). Rather, \none should have a working knowledge of and healthy respect for the \never-present delusive satanic power and thereby keep oneself wholly \nimmune to evil influences. \nListen to the voice of God echoing in your good thoughts. These \nare strong intimations from God and His angelic spirits to guide and \nhelp you. Satan also is exerting his influence with his own kind of con-\ntrary mental instigations. Every time a bad thought or impulse comes, \ncast out that devilish entity; then Satan cannot do anything to you. \nWhy remain a mortal captive, oscillating between good and evil? Es-\ncape into the heart of Spirit where Satan and his horde will be unable \nto reach you. \n*See Discourse 8, page 179. \n408 \n"}

The \npowerful energy transmitted by a Christlike soul into the brain of a \npsychologically diseased individual has a similarly direct effect in \nburning out bad karma and entrenched harmful mental tendencies. \nGod-realized gurus thereby free their receptive disciples from habits of \nignorance that have hounded them for many incarnations. \nWhen Jesus healed a person who was possessed, he did it by two \nways. First, his consciousness being in tune with the Christ Intelligence \nin all creation, he used the Christ Will, which governs the astral forces \nand entities, to compel the unclean spirit to leave the body of the dis-\neased individual. Second, he used his will power to send the cosmic \nenergy into the brain of the possessed individual and destroy there the \nobsessions caused by the unclean spirit, as well as the karmic and \nhabit patterns that made the person prone to possession. \nIn the present verses under consideration, it is related that when \nJesus exorcised the devils from many, they came out crying, '\"Thou \nart Christ, the Son of God.' And he rebuking them suffered them not \nto speak.\" Since all things of the astral world are hidden according to \nthe will of God, concealing the dynamics of the mysterious workings \nof material creation, Jesus did not want himself to be revealed except \nin the natural human way by the declaration of his works in fulfill-\nment of the words of the prophets. \nIn even a cursory review of the science of various forms of heal-\ning, it is evident that the basis of every formula is the vibratory power \nof the life force supported by the receptivity of the \n• • \nperson to be healed. Positive-minded confidence in \nChoosing the appro-\nthe effectiveness of the remedy stimulates the heal- \npriate mode of heal-\ning life force. Therefore, methods of mental or \ning for individual \nphysical healing should be administered to people \ncircumstances \naccording to their mental inclinations and mental \nhabits. Jesus said, \"Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's\" \n—that is, in adaptation, those who believe in medical healing, let them \ngo to the medical doctors; those who believe in healing by the meth-\nods of osteopaths or homeopaths or other \"natural\" remedies, let \nthem use such methods; those who believe in mental healers, let them \ngo to the mental healers. But above all, no matter what one's health \npractices, the most important belief must be in the unlimited healing \npower of God and the intercession of masters who are one with God. \n465 \n"}

Such medical intervention should not be \nthought of as a negation, but rather an enhancement, of the effective-\nness of continually applied mental and spiritual methods of promot-\ning healing. Those more malleable conditions that have a psychologi-\ncal basis—such as nervous or emotional disorders, mild obsessions, \nbad habits—as well as common physical ailments that merely require \nan arousal or reinforcement of weakened life force, most readily re-\nspond to the healer's and patient's use of suggestion, divine will force, \nand invocation of God's power.

Belief in and appli-\ncation of one does not necessarily contradict the other so long as one's \nfaith inheres in the Creator Himself. \nOnly God has unlimited power of healing. Man's power may fail, \nbut God's power can never fail. Yet even though our Father does not \nwant to see us suffer from disease, He cannot heal us until we open \nthe gates of our willingness to be healed: By misusing our God-given \nfree choice, we shut God out of our lives; by using it properly, we al-\nlow Him to become manifest within us. To be sure of God's healing \npower, one must know Him, one must feel Him deeply, in meditation \ndaily. He is not some unfeeling Cosmic Power that one can switch on \nand off at one's convenience or need—with expectation of instant \nblessings in times of dark distress, but to which one can remain \nblithely oblivious in the bright contentment of good fortune.

As they give all their devotion to God, so \nalso God gives to them His unlimited power for healing of body, mind, \nand soul. Devotees who seek to be healed of ignorance, the root cause \nof all maladies, should adhere steadfastly to faith in their true God-\nsent guru and his guidance and intercession on their behalf. \nJesus used only the divine power of healing; and he gave to God all \nthe credit for those miraculous cures, for he did not feel within himself \nthe \"I\" or ego-consciousness born of the identifica- \n• • \ntion of the soul with the physical body. Even when \nEgotism: a pitfall to \nJesus said, \"I say unto you, arise\"—become healed \nbe avoided in practice \n—he spoke not of the \"I\" of the ego, but of the un- \nof spiritual healing \nlimited God-consciousness with which his soul was \nunited. Unless the soul divests itself of the \"I am\" ego-consciousness, by \nthe divine intuitional consciousness of interiorized meditation, one re-\nmains ineptly disunited from Spirit. When an ordinary person says, \"I \nwill do this,\" the \"I\" refers to his body-identified ego-consciousness. He \ncannot differentiate himself from his physical form, and hardly feels the \ndeeper consciousness of his soul. But when Jesus referred to the \"I\" \nwithin him, he always meant his soul-consciousness united with God-\nconsciousness. \nNo matter how effective one's powers of healing, they are limited \nas compared to the infinite healing power of God. Hence, instead of \nmerely commanding one's own healing powers, one should set himself \napart from the ego and invoke the unlimited divine power of God to \nflow through himself as a clear channel. In the practice of healing one-\nself or others, one should be sure of divine communion, and then com-\npletely absorb oneself in God preceding the attempted performance of \nevery healing. A divine healing can take place only when the healer \nserves as a perfect medium through which God's omnipotence can flow \nwithout obstruction. Egotism and loud declaration, and self-laudation, \nsuch as, \"I healed her,\" or \"God is working through me,\" should be \nstrictly avoided both in speech and mind. Let the all-knowing God de-\nclare His power in the self-evident healing. \nEven a sincere devotee, if not truly one with God by Self-realization, \ncan have traces of ego hiding in him undetected when he puts himself for-\nward as a healing instrument and says to the sick, \"Be healed by God's \npower.\" But the superman, having transcended all separating egotism in \nactual God-union, speaks from perfect humility even when he declares, \n467 \n"}

If anyone, through wrong eating, for example, \nis carrying a load of poison in his body, he can take a counteracting \nmedicine to create a new cause with an effect that can destroy the vir-\nulence in the system. So Jesus, with his powerful consciousness, could \nby various means counteract the adverse effects of past wrongs ac-\nquired by and accumulated in erring persons. But no one, not even a \nJesus, can break the law of cause and effect created by God. Nature's \njudgments must be compensated in kind or by a fair exchange. Cer-\ntain mechanics of the law of karma can be manipulated by the wis-\ndom of a master, and also by corrective or palliative measures taken \nby the afflicted — such as prayer, intense love for God, faith, yoga \nmeditation, conscious direction of the life force by will power—to \nminimize or nullify adverse effects of past wrong actions. In extreme \ncases of deep-seated karma; or in response to the devotional faith and \nreceptivity of a supplicant; or to hasten the spiritual evolution of a dis-\nciple, a master can take onto himself a karmic condition of a devotee, \nor a portion of it, and work out the effects on his own body. \nThus Jesus could stop the impending result of an evil action by as-\ntrally taking the consequences of that action upon himself, thereby \nsparing the person guilty of the transgression. To illustrate the princi-\nple in simple terms, suppose a frail man named John angered a more \nrobust acquaintance, who then raised his hand to beat John; but I sud-\ndenly came between John and the well-directed blow, sparing John the \nhurt. I, being stronger, might be affected to a far lesser degree, or not \nat all, by the fistic display. \nSo, also, when wrong actions have condemned a person to suffer, \naccording to the law of cause and effect, a powerful soul such as Jesus \ncould deflect the havoc and work it out by spending its force within \nhimself. Some saints have been known to take into their own bodies the \nactual diseases of afflicted persons, and thus cause the sufferers to be re-\nlieved. This does not mean that one has to suffer in order to cure by spir-\n468 \n"}

Only extraordinary Christlike healers and masters know the \nsacred method by which they can take on the physical, mental, or spir-\nitual sufferings of others and work them out in their own bodies. The \npurpose of a world savior or guru is to heal humanity of its threefold \nills. Their bodily instrument having already fulfilled its purpose of ex-\npressing God-realization is then used for the sake of redeeming others \nby whatever means are most advantageous for the devotee. \nThis is why it is said of Jesus that he gave himself as a ransom for \nmany. He took upon himself the sins of his disciples, and many other \nsouls, and let his body be crucified. He had the power to save himself \nby prayer to God: \"...and He shall presently give me more than twelve \nlegions of angels. But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that \nthus it must be?\"* Especially by his taking on the consequences of his \ndisciples' karma through his sacrifice, they were highly spiritualized to \nbe able to receive the Holy Ghost that later descended on them, bap-\ntizing them with the divine consciousness and attunement to carry on \nand spread the mission of Jesus. Whether in the body or in omnipresent \nSpirit, the redeeming grace of a world savior or God-realized guru re-\nmains the same, obliging every humble entreaty of a receptive heart. \nNo matter what one's ailment or blessing of cure, the only way all \nundesirable karma can be permanently destroyed is by God-contact. \nThe body is impermanent; even though it be granted a pardon from \nsickness, it must in its full season perish. The mind is pliant and can by \na strong will be inured to many of the assaults of its environment; yet \nit too remains susceptible to the fallibilities of delusion. The ultimate \nhealing that must be sought is freedom from the contagious disease of \nspiritual ignorance, the enervation of soul-expression, which is at the \nroot of all other ills. If one removes by meditation and God-contact the \ndisease of ignorance constraining the soul, then automatically mental \nand physical karmic compulsions lose their hold as well. In the king-\ndom of God-consciousness, the authoritative power of karmic law— \nwhich operates only as a corrective guiding force in the presence of \ndelusion—serves no further purpose and is dissolved in Wisdom. Thus \ndid Jesus admonish: \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God (destroy delu-\nsion) and all else (the consummation of all man's prayers, including for \nhealing of the body, mind, and soul) will be added unto you (as your \ndivine birthright as a child of God).\" \n* Matthew 2 6 : 5 3 - 5 4 . \n469 \n"}

The \nperformance of one duty should not starve out other important duties. \nOne-sidedness is a sure formula for unhappiness. It will create a \npainful paucity in other aspects of one's threefold nature. \nGod is often the last to receive attention on one's daily agenda: \n\"As soon as I get time, I will meditate.\" Where does that time go? Yet \nanyone who performs the highest duty of knowing God is automati-\ncally guided in accordance with God's will in the performance of the \nroster of other lesser duties. It is disastrous to seek prosperity at the \ncost of health or to seek health while entirely neglecting to strive to be \nsuccessful and prosperous. But since God is the source of all power, it \nis right to seek Him first, for, with God, health and prosperity are \nadded; but with the acquirement of health and prosperity alone, God \nis not attained. So the commitment of ardent renunciants to seek God \nfirst by forsaking material goals is the consummate life; for God, once \nattained, enriches one with imperishable life and eternal opulence. \nWhatever be one's vocation in life, one needs to feel his connection \nwith God. The cultivation of a spiritual life requires solitary places for \ndivine communion. God can be felt easily in inspiring scenic surround-\nings free from noise. Man's mind is usually busy with the sensations of \nsight, sound, touch, smell, and taste. Sound is the most distracting sen-\nsation. The sight of material objects or material activities also snares \nman's attention. But by closing the eyes, one can quickly get rid of the \nsight sensation, whereas freedom from sound sensations can best be at-\ntained by being in a quiet place. The novice devotee who attempts to \nmeditate in noisy surroundings finds his time of \"silence\" entirely taken \nup in battling the restless thoughts the noises arouse. In a quiet atmos-\nphere, one can go deep into the silence without any preliminary skirmish \nwith the sensations of sounds. However, if a person makes a super ef-\nfort of will, he can concentrate in spite of such distraction. \nIn noisy places there are also people to interrupt one's meditative \nendeavors. The vibrations of their restless thoughts and activities pass \nthrough the body of the meditating individual and keep his energy \nrushing toward the senses instead of being released to flow toward \nGod. While it is very helpful to the beginner to meditate on quiet oc-\ncasions and in solitary places, this does not mean that one should not \nmeditate unless one has a chance to travel to a place of solitude.

Whatever be one's \nsanctuary of solitude, he will find it especially beneficial to pray and \nmeditate any time during the following periods: from the earliest hour \nof dawn, from 5 to 8 a.m.; noontime from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.; evening \nfrom 5 to 8 p.m.; and nighttime from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. The masters \nof India have taught that the hours surrounding the transitional times \nof dawn, noon, sunset, and midnight of each solar day are conducive \nto the cultivation of spiritual development. The magnetic cosmic laws \nof attraction and repulsion that affect the body are more harmo-\nniously equilibrated during the above four periods.

But I suddenly \nchanged my mind, remembering the decree of nonviolence. Master \nsaid: \"Why don't you finish the job?\" In astonishment, I replied: \n\"Why, Master? Do you advocate killing?\" To that he responded: \"No, \nbut you have killed the mosquito in your mind and thus have already \ncommitted the sin.\" \nMy Guru did not mean that whenever anybody has an impulse to \nkill, he should do so; he was making the point that one should not feel \nthe desire to kill at all. Of course, it is better to suppress the desire to \nkill than to commit the actual act; but the greater achievement is to re-\nmain free from evil thoughts, which are the basic cause of evil actions.* \nThought, the forerunner of outer action, is itself action on a sub-\ntler plane. In that sense, according to the law of karma or action, \nrighteousness and sin lie in one's thoughts and motives as well as in \nhis external behavior. One man commits murder and is hanged for it; \n*In Autobiography \nof a Yogi I recorded the following discussion I had with my Guru \nabout Patanjali's Yoga Sutras 11:35: \"In the presence of a man perfected in ahimsa (non-\nviolence), enmity [in any creature] does not arise.\" Sri Yukteswar said: \n\"By ahimsa Patanjali meant removal of the desire to kill....This world is inconve-\nniently arranged for a literal practice of ahimsa. Man may be compelled to extermi-\nnate harmful creatures. He is not under a similar compulsion to feel anger or animos-\nity. All forms of life have an equal right to the air of maya. The saint who uncovers the \nsecret of creation will be in harmony with Nature's countless bewildering expressions. \nAll men may understand this truth by overcoming the passion for destruction.\" \nI then asked: \"Guruji, should one offer himself a sacrifice rather than kill a wild \nbeast?\" \n\" N o , man's body is precious. It has the highest evolutionary value because of \nunique brain and spinal centers. These enable the advanced devotee fully to grasp and \nexpress the loftiest aspects of divinity. N o lower form is so equipped. It is true that a \nman incurs the debt of a minor sin if he is forced to kill an animal or any other living \nthing. But the holy shastras teach that wanton loss of a human body is a serious trans-\ngression against the karmic law.\" \n464 \n"}

However, one's mo-\ntives must be wisdom-pure. I remember the opportunistic students in \nmy classes who found this opening in the door of right behavior a \nconvenient exit: \"My motive justified my actions.\" My response, with \ngratitude to the author for a succinct rebuttal, was to quote: \"The \nroad to Hades is paved with good intentions.\" \nThe law of cause and effect bestows good or bad fruits of actions \naccording to a person's good or bad activities. Every action—mental or \nphysical—produces a result in the form of a tendency, which is lodged \nin the mind as a karmic seed. This mental-tendency seed germinates into \naction when the conditions of environment provide the necessary \"wa-\ntering.\" A good mental seed produces good action and a bad seed re-\nsults in evil performance. One should be very careful how he acts, for \nthe power of leftover corresponding tendencies makes actions repeat \nthemselves—becoming more deeply integrated into one's nature with \neach repetition. It is all right when good actions are repeated, but dis-\nastrous when evil actions insinuate themselves against the will of the \nperformer. Every wrong action brings calamity from \"the judgment\" — \nfrom the result proceeding from the law of cause and effect. \nOne can measure one's emotional self-control by testing it on those \nnearest and dearest to him. If he can neutralize his impulses to become \nangry (or to vent any other acrid emotion) in response to provocations, \nthen he is developing himself in the spirit of the law as admonished by \nJesus. To control the external expression of anger while seething within \ncreates an inner vibratory heat that cooks one's brain like a slowly baked \npotato. Lahiri Mahasaya gave those methods of meditation by which \none can instead roast the seeds of wrong impulses. Scientific meditation \nharmonizes the whole being, creating an inner calmness of self-mastery. \nJesus makes another point in these verses: Words are very potent \nvibratory actions, affecting favorably or adversely the one who utters \nthem and also the one to whom they are directed. To express contempt \nto any individual (\"say to his brother, 'Raca'\"*) is spiritually libelous \n* Raca: a derogatory term in Aramaic (literally, \"I spit on you\") conveying extreme \ncontempt. \n465 \n"}

To gaze upon a woman with lustful desire. \n5. To hold private intimate talks with a woman with the ultimate \nhope of physical union. \n6. The act of physical union without the consecration of marriage. \n\"Sin\" requires a complex definition. It is not a transgression \nagainst an arbitrary code of behavior decreed by a whimsical God. \nThe Creator made man a spiritual being, a soul endowed with an in-\ndividualization of His own divine nature. He gave to the soul, evolved \nfrom its own Self, the instruments of a body and a mind with which \nto perceive and interact with the objects of a mjyj-manifested uni-\nverse.

According to spiritual law, therefore, to use the sexual in-\nstinct solely to gratify sensual desire is considered sinful, detrimental \nto man's godly image. A married man also commits sin, as pointed out \nby Jesus, if he thinks lustfully of his wife, whose feminine nature \nshould be respectfully loved and regarded as God's motherly aspect. \nHealthful hunger can be appeased by using the sense of taste to \nselect the right foods, but greed for food can never be satisfied and \ncompounds its ill effects by choosing an unhealthful diet. Similarly, \nphysical union for procreation is as nature intends, but indulgence is \nnever appeased, and is destructive to health and the nervous system, \ndisturbing the entire mental, neural, and spiritual faculties. \nThe mind is single-tracked when it becomes fixated on an impulse. \nOnce it gets used to sex habits, it is very difficult to make it move in the \nelevating channels of meditation. Sex-addicted persons are very nervous \nand restless; their minds wander constantly on the plane of the senses, \nmaking it difficult to concentrate upon the inner peace that leads the con-\nsciousness to the all-intoxicating, ever new bliss of God-communion. \nThe vital essence lost in physical union contains untold atomic \nunits of lifetronic intelligence and energy; the loss of this power, due \nto indiscriminate excesses, is extremely harmful to spiritual develop-\nment. It exacerbates the outflow of life force through the lowest sub-\ntle center at the base of the spine, concentrating the consciousness on \nidentification with the body and external sensory perceptions.

In oneness \nwith God, he sees himself as the Self of all, and \nfinds equal enjoyment whether he himself dons his \"cloak\" or takes it \noff from his one body and puts it on another one of his bodies. What-\never the divine person does for another, he feels by such action that he \nhas in a nonattached way done this for himself, only in another body \n—just as one transfers a ring from one finger to another. \nGiving away one's \"cloak\" as well as one's \"coat\" may seem like \nvery unpractical advice in the modern world. No doubt, one must use \ndiscrimination. Abnegation of one's own material needs can best be \ncompletely practiced only by saints or by people living under ideal \nconditions. One is under no spiritual compulsion to give his home \naway to an unscrupulous defrauder; instead, he is compelled to de-\nmand lawful justice from those who are unjust to him. \nIt would be ludicrous to offer a thief or a blackmailer more than \nwas demanded, or for a victim to suggest to a kidnapper who has \ntaken him forty miles away from his home, he would be willing to go \nforty miles further! The spiritual ideal in these words of Jesus is to be \nselflessly generous and openhearted, and willing to go that extra mile \nin helping others. \nOne should practice the virtue of giving to deserving people what \none can afford to give without causing himself or those dependent \nupon him for their needs an enforced hardship.

Such action is admirable if the sacrifice is performed with the \nwilling agreement of the other persons concerned. Gandhi had a mis-\nsion to fulfill, which would be best accomplished by identifying him-\nself materially as well as spiritually with the downtrodden masses. \nPractical sympathy toward those in need dispels the darkness of \nseparation between souls and is the light by which one can see all hearts \ntied together with the singular golden cord of divine love. God throbs \nin all hearts, suffering in the afflicted, rejoicing in those that are whole. \nThe same spirit of nonattachment should accompany the sharing \nof one's goods with would-be borrowers. It shows compassion to lend \nto needy people, but let not that virtue be negated by anger if the \nmoney is not returned. It is better not to lend at all than to become \nupset or ugly because the debtor is unable to pay back what he owes. \nPractical advice would be to lend only what one can afford to give \naway and forget all about it. Conscientious persons will make good \non what they owe when and as they are able, and unscrupulous per-\nsons will not honor their debt even if they can afford to. \nTo lend money with the assurance of a returned favor, or the gain \nof a favorable interest, is ordinary business. But to lend to the needy \nwho may or may not be able to repay—to help others without the de-\nsire for material reward; to give something without the hope of get-\nting something better in return — is divine. Those who give of their \nmaterial goods with the presumption of compensation receive tempo-\nrary material things or advantages only; those who give with an open \nheart, just for the pleasure of giving pleasure to others, receive their \nrepayment with a dividend of divine love. \nThere is nothing wrong in expecting the return of what one lends \nto others, not only for tending to one's own needs but for further shar-\ning with others. But those things that one can spare, and that have \nbeen given to others to use, should not be demanded back simply to \nassert one's right of ownership. Possessiveness shows meanness of \nheart.

The poison of hate increases by hatred \nand can be counteracted and neutralized only by the chemical of love. \nInimical persons burn themselves with hatred and anger, con-\nsuming their inner peace.

To hate an enemy is to make him \nstronger, whereas his enmity is weakened by kindness until he may fi-\nnally realize his fault. \nThus, Jesus says: \"Bless them that curse you\"—that is, wish good \nfor those who wish evil for you. If, as often as anyone wishes evil on \na person, that person responds by wishing good in return, the assailant \ncannot long retain his evil attitude against that well-wisher.

A \ncurse for a curse cannot stop an enemy's hatred, but to love and bless \na malicious scorner is to place before him a good example that may \nserve to change his attitude. \nAction speaks louder than words. Thus Jesus says, \"Do good to \nthem that hate you.\" Not only should one mentally love a detractor, but \nactually do good to him.

The illumined Saint Teresa of \nAvila used the identical metaphor to teach her nuns the way to enter the \"interior cas-\ntle\" to commune with Christ: \"When we are seeking God within ourselves (where He is \nfound more effectively and more profitably than in the creatures, to quote Saint Augus-\ntine, who after having sought Him in many places, found Him within) it is a great help \nif God grants us this favour [conscious interiorization]. Do not suppose that the under-\nstanding can attain to Him, merely by trying to think of Him as within the soul, or the \nimagination, by picturing Him as there.

When that sensory compulsion disap-\npears, then the craving for God automatically appears. \nSensations pouring in through the sensory nerves keep the mind \nfilled with myriad noisy thoughts, so that the whole attention is toward \nthe senses. But God's voice is silence. Only when restless thoughts cease \ncan one hear the voice of God communicating through the silence of \nintuition. That is God's means of expression. In the devotee's silence \nGod's silence ceases. For the devotee whose consciousness is inwardly \nunited with God, an audible response from Him is unnecessary—intu-\nitive thoughts and true visions constitute God's voice. These are not the \nresult of the stimuli of the senses, but the combination of the devotee's \nsilence and God's voice of silence. \nGod has been with His children on earth all the time, talking to \nthem; but His voice of silence has been drowned out by the noisiness \nof their thoughts: \"Thou didst love me always, but I heard Thee not.\" \nHe has always been near; it is the consciousness of man that has been \nwandering away from Him. \nIn spite of man's indifference and pursuit of sense pleasures, still \nGod's love abides, and always will.

By \ncontinuous affirmation, associating with the wise, studying the scrip-\ntures, and above all by meditation in which the conscious dream of \nmortal limitation is completely dissolved in the superconscious per-\nception of the soul, the persevering devotee will know he is a god. Di-\nvine communion restores man to his original Self. He realizes complete \nsatisfaction in all goodness in his soul, and that to crave any tempting \nofferings of the senses would, to his heartbreak, eclipse the incompa-\nrable divine joy. \nSelf-control is the master of temptation. It does not speak highly \nof the human race when man acts like less evolved creatures. Even \nbeasts behave more wisely, being guided by instinct. Only in the com-\npany of human beings do they learn to live unnaturally. There is no \nevil in them, because their actions have no discriminative freewill mo-\ntivations. Man is spiritually bound to make choices between right and \nwrong—beneficial or harmful. Unless he develops self-control, he will \nact unwisely when tempted, even against his better judgment. \nMany learn self-control only after getting burned in the enticing \nflames of harmful indulgences. It is better to avoid painful lessons by \nobservation of consequences inflicted on others, by obedience to spir-\nitual teachings, and by wise discrimination. Without discriminative \nself-control the refined beauty of virtue is overshadowed by the gaudy \ntinsel of the senses. \nHe who says temptation is not charming lies. By temptation man \nis blithely led into trouble because of the hypnotic allure of evil. No \none would indulge in vices if they did not give pleasure. The drug ad-\ndict, the alcoholic, the sex addict, the indiscriminate overeater, had a \ngood time indulging their habit, but at the cost of slowly killing their \nhappiness and themselves. \nTemptation is the undue influence on the senses of something al-\nluring that one thinks is harmless, but isn't. It is the desire to have a \nmoment's pleasure, disregarding its future ill effects. \nAs counterfeit coins have no value but may be hard to differenti-\nate from the genuine article, likewise it takes discrimination to know \nthe difference between pleasure derived from attractive but worthless \nvices and real happiness, which is the valuable worth of virtue.

The saints define as evil anything, no matter how nice \nit seems, that is subversive to God-contact and the expression of the \nsoul's qualities, which produce true happiness. \nThe joy of God-communion, once tasted, is more tempting than \nall mundane temptations. If man tempts himself with that true plea-\nsure, the temptation of the senses will wane. I have always prayed, \n\"Lord, why don't You reveal Yourself in the very beginning and then \nthere will be no suffering from seeking pleasure in harmful actions?\" \nBecause God is the supremely charming experience, it is only when \nman does not have that comparison that evil temptation has power. \nWould anyone eat rotten cheese if he had good cheese? Would anyone \nprefer suffering to joy? No. Man yields to temptation because of the \ndelusion that it will bring happiness. Criminals think they will get hap-\npiness from money they steal; but they find that crime does not pay. \nNeither does succumbing to the temptations of the senses. \nSense perceptions are natural and necessary to man's conscious \nphysical existence; the relentless predators of his happiness and well-\nbeing are the sensuous actions that arise from perceptions and that are \nungoverned by discrimination. The senses of hearing, smell, and sight \ncan usually be overtaxed with little ill effect. Few people are foolish \nenough to strain their eyes to the point of blindness. No one smells \nflowers or perfumes long enough to cause death. Unless the volume of \nsound is excessive, people do not make themselves deaf by continu-\nously listening to good music. However, the sense of sight may be \nbaited by attractions that result in wrong judgments and misery. The \nsense of hearing may mislead the weak-willed by receptivity to dulcet \ntones of flattery, or harsh vibrations that arouse anger. The sense of \nsmell can stand much abuse without retaliation, but it is a powerful \nmeans of stimulating memory and habit impulses and sexual arousal. \nDreadful consequences follow when the sense of taste or touch is \novertaxed. How easy it is, when catering to the palate, to overeat or \nto make unhealthful choices in food, which causes disease and hastens \ndeath. How easy it is, when enslaved by desires of the flesh, to suc-\ncumb to physical temptations and indiscretions that bring ill health, \nsatiety, social ostracism, matrimonial disaster—all manner of baneful \nconsequences. God created infinite Bliss to attract man back to his true \nsoul-nature; Satan created the sexual pleasure of the flesh, the stron-\ngest urge in man, along with self-preservation, to keep him infatuated \nwith his mortal existence. \n504 \n"}

When the joy of God, felt in meditation \nwith stillness of thoughts and breath, remains continuously in the soul, \nphysical temptation is subdued in a natural way through contrast with \nthis higher consciousness of divine Bliss. \nSo it is right for the devotee to pray to God, \"Do not put before \nmy weak impulses the temptations of Your cosmic maya.\" Delusive \nsensory temptations are like seeds, and weak mental impulses are their \nfavorite soil. When the seeds of temptation are in a fertile mind, they \nbegin to grow. But if they are dried up by wisdom and the realization \nof God as the only reality, latent material desires will lose their com-\npelling power. \nMan is surrounded by fascinations that lure his interest and cloud \nhis reason. No one is safe from giving in to wrong influences in a weak \nmoment until all desires and habits of the past that are grooved in the \nbrain cells are cauterized. The influence of those habits and impulses \nis very strong. When man submits to them he renounces his free will \nand good judgment. He should refuse subjugation. \nUntil man is free from compulsions, he cannot trust himself. He \nacts like an automaton, moving to the remote-control influence of his \nimmediate environment and the company he keeps as they arouse his \nown innate latent tendencies. Of course, a person may become good \nor bad due to his own free choice, but in most cases his behavior and \nhabits can be ascribed to prenatal causes or hidden postnatal effects \nof actions. \nThe Hindu scriptures teach that it is difficult to get away from the \neffects arising from physical, mental, moral, or spiritual errors made \nin this life or in past lives. The results of good and bad actions are \nstored in the superconscious and subconscious minds as seed tenden-\ncies, samskaras, ready to germinate and grow when the specific suit-\nable opportunity arrives. \nThat is why man should ask the Maker of cosmic delusion to pro-\ntect him from temptation: \"Lead us not into places and conditions \nwhere our karmic impulses coincide with the temptations of the evils \nof the world. Lead us into the joyous experience of Thy contact.\" Can-\ndlelight becomes lost in the light of the sun; the flicker of sense plea-\nsures disappears in the conflagration of ecstasy. \"O Lord, let us not be \n505 \n"}

Each per-\nson has to fight his personal battles in the war between his reason and \nsense impulses, to see which will win. To foolishly yield to the forces of \ntemptation is to lose sovereignty over the kingdom of one's life. Saints \nare sinners who never gave up. They never gave up rejecting the temp-\ntations of the world while continuing to tempt themselves with the \ngreater joy of God. \"I weighed Thee and temptation and found Thee \nmore tempting than temptation.\" One must be convinced in his heart \nand know he loves God more than temptation; then he will find God. \nThe ordinary person does not see, except in an objective way, the \nfierce resistance of Satan against the magnetic attraction of goodness \nand God. The devil has been known to manifest in form to tempt great \nsaints who near liberation, but this conscious force knows it requires \nno such theatrics to catch the average man or the striving devotee— \nlittle subtle temptations usually suffice. The person who is trying to \navoid temptation will find it suddenly \"coincidental\" that persons and \nopportunities seem to appear out of nowhere to conspire to take him \nfrom his determined path of self-control. \nFor every goodness and virtue, Satan has an equal storehouse of \ncounteracting agents. God created forgiveness; Satan created revenge. \nGod created calmness, fearlessness, unselfishness, spirit of brother-\nhood, peace, love, understanding, wisdom, and happiness, and for \neach of these Satan created its psychological opposite of restlessness, \nfear, greed, individual and material selfishness, war, hate; anger, re-\nvenge, and jealousy instead of understanding; ignorance in place of \nwisdom; and sorrow to destroy happiness. Conscience, the voice of \nGod, always beckons man to do right. Temptation, the voice of Satan, \ncoaxes him to do wrong. \nThe existence of this host of evils is the reason Jesus prayed: \"Thy \nkingdom come,\" that man might use his independence to act rightly \nand thereby substitute the kingdom of God for the anarchy of evil. By \nperfected living, man helps to make God's heaven from Satan's earthly \nimperfections, effecting God's patterns to nullify the evil designs of Sa-\ntan.

That \nis the hardest prayer for God to satisfy: \"If I give Myself, I have noth-\ning left.\" When God gives Himself to the devotee, He has given every-\nthing— His ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss, Love, Wis-\ndom— oneness with Spirit in which the mystery of life is no more. \nVanished is the duality of the multiplicity in the Indivisible Unity in \nthe devotee's awakening from the Cosmic Dream. With the realization \nthat all things are of God—all things are His dreaming consciousness \n—comes the consummate fulfillment of the words of Jesus that hav-\ning Him, whatsoever shall be needful for one's role in the cosmic \ndrama \"shall be added unto you.\" \nThat state of oneness with God is granted by Him only when He \nis convinced the devotee does not want anything else. As long as there \nwill be a single desire in the heart for other than God, then even though \nHe will be near the devotee, He will not be fully manifest to him. While \nwaiting patiently for there to be room in the devotee's heart for the giv-\ning of Himself, He continues lovingly to grant the devotee's simple, le-\ngitimate prayers: \"Lord, although I have to satisfy a few material de-\nsires to get along as a mortal being, still in my heart there is only You. \nAs Your child, O Lord, I have no desire, because I already have You; \nand as You have everything, so have You bequeathed that divine in-\nheritance to me.\" When the devotee with that devotion seeks Him and \nlives righteously, he cannot fail in his God-seeking. \nJesus then summarized: \"Take therefore no thought for the mor-\nrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Suffi-\ncient unto the day is the evil thereof.\" If the devotee lives with God \n529 \n"}

In this \npassage Jesus enunciates that cause-and-effect mechanism of \nthe karmic law as a sort of moral threat to those who mercilessly ex-\npose the faults of others, that their own faults similarly will be brought \ninto the light of harsh scrutiny. In the same spirit in \n— \nwhich one judges others, the divine law judges the \nKarmic \nconsequences \ncensurer—motivation, as well as the action itself, \nof being \nunkindly \nis an integral part of the cause-effect equation. \njudgmental \nPunishment or reward is not imparted by God \neither as an act of vengeance or of special favoritism; good and evil re-\nsults are the reflex outcome of good and evil actions. Since even God \ndoes not judge anyone's actions, having delegated that function to the \nimpartial law of karma, by what right do small-minded humans pre-\nsume to do so? Those who are already judged and automatically sen-\ntenced by the karmic law for their misguided actions do not need to \nbe criticized or condemned by anybody else. A person who misuses his \nfree choice and opens himself to evil karmic effects needs sympathy in-\nstead of criticism. It pleases God when He beholds a spiritually fortu-\nnate individual trying to rescue an unfortunate brother who is being \ntorn by the talons of the effects of bad actions. When He sees a soul \nhelping another soul out of the entanglements of misery-making \nkarma, He extends mercy and all-forgiving blessings by which the \nsympathetic soul finds himself free from many of the effects of his own \ndireful karma. \nBy the operation of the same cosmic law, to judge others cruelly \nis to attract malicious criticism upon oneself. If one peddles the weak-\nnesses of others, the divine law will mysteriously bring about the pub-\nlicity of his own private faults. One who is tempted to cast aspersion \non anyone else should first ask himself: \"Am I without error?\" Judge \nye not others; judge and change yourself first. \nCruel speech and behavior have their origin in cruel thoughts. If \none is constantly unkind, it means his mind is a harbor for unkind \nthoughts. According to the psychological law of habit, the more one \ngives mental space to mean thoughts the more he will accustom him-\nself to being mean-spirited, exciting and angering others by his un-\nconscionable behavior, and thereby attracting unkindness to himself. \n535 \n"}

He is truly wise who knows when it is right \nto speak and when it is better to remain silent. \nThere is a great deal of misconception about the ideal of being \nnonjudgmental versus one's duty to speak the truth.

One who does is \nheld liable for helping criminals to evade punishment. \nLikewise, \"condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned\" is not \nmeant as a promise that obliviousness to others' faults somehow frees \none from the karmic sentence of one's own. What Jesus meant is that \none who is sympathetic to his fellows will attract the sympathy of oth-\ners and God. If John tries to help Judas extricate himself from the mis-\neries resulting from past evil actions, by giving him succor and guiding \nhim to the path of righteousness, then according to the law of karma \nJohn will attract some advanced soul or souls who would help him es-\ncape having to endure the full burden of his own karmic recompense. \n\"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged.\" \"What \njudgment\" signifies that judging is of different kinds: kind or cruel, al-\ntruistic or self-serving, wise or ill-advised.

It is all right \nto help a brother avoid a painful tumble into the same ditch of error \ninto which one has fallen. To warn others about the hazards of evil, \nbased on one's own bitter experience, is good if it is done in private \nwith the sole desire of saving them from impending misery. To criti-\ncize others is hard enough on the recipients without hurting them— \nto no good purpose—by exposure, gossip, or malicious taunting. Self-\nappointed critics and informers have no right to expose others' faults \npublicly; it is a sin against God who dwells in the temple of the error-\nstricken as well as in the righteous. The stricken individual should be \noffered help in the form of wise counsel if such is requested, or in the \nform of the better example of one who is victorious over himself, or \nif totally belligerent he should be left alone to find his own spiritual \nremedy. In any case, one should never tell other people their faults in \npublic—or even in private if they are unreceptive to being helped, un-\nless it is positively one's duty. \nIn a family, it is the responsibility of the parents to guide and cor-\nrect the children's behavior, but there is no need to criticize in front of \nthe whole household.

It is better that the psychological operation be done at \nhome, or by the guru in the ashram, with kindness, love, and the high-\nest interest of the \"patient\" uppermost in mind. \nEven when punishment is justifiable, it should be administered to \nwrongdoers quietly and in a way that encourages them to try to re-\nform themselves.

No one should be called a sinner; nor should anyone think \nof himself as a sinner. Hate the sin but not the sinner. The critic \nshould treat the errant as he would hope to be treated for his own \nsinful mistakes. Those who are wrong do not need scornful kicks; \nthey need a firm but loving hand extended to them.

Such \npersons should balance reason with empathy, understanding that every \nindividual life is difficult, complex, and as deserving of sympathy as \ntheir own. It is human nature to make broad allowances for one's own \nmistakes and shortcomings; certainly similar tolerance and under-\nstanding should be extended to others. \nOne should not open himself up to just anybody or everybody to \ncritique his behavior or character. The opinions of those who are not \nqualified to criticize, especially those who carp and condemn in order \nto create disharmony or simply for the perverse pleasure it affords \nthem, should be little noted or ignored altogether. There are two ways \nto disarm undeserving critics: to be abjectly indifferent to them, or to \nbe lovingly indifferent to them. The latter is better. If one has the fault \nof which he is accused, no matter the source of accusation, he need \nnot blatantly announce or confirm the disclosure of his fault, but qui-\n* \"Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall \nnot enter into the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 18:3).

Redemption is not forthcoming until the \nwrongdoer is convinced of the error of his ways. Persons who repeat evil \nactions usually begin to develop a strong compulsive liking for that be-\nhavior, in spite of any consequent suffering. Without an understanding \nand acknowledgment of the inimical nature of sorrow-producing sinful \nactions, those who succumb to temptation can never find in themselves \nthe will to repent. The error-prone must first be reasoned with, so that \ntheir paralyzed discrimination may be brought back to life. \nOnce discriminative reason is awakened, repentance usually fol-\nlows; when people feel sorry for their evil actions, they want freedom \nfrom those habits. Without repentance, those in delusion make no ef-\nfort to liberate themselves spiritually. Therefore, when one sees the in-\nanity of his evil actions, he must repent and use his free will repeatedly \nto perform redeeming actions that reinforce his liberating good karma. \nGreat spiritual teachers never claim to forgive unrepentant of-\nfenders; their work is to awaken the natural righteousness in wrong-\ndoers to the point where they will make an effort to free themselves. \nNo one can prevent confirmed evildoers from reaping the effects of \ntheir evil actions; but if they rouse themselves to righteous efforts, the \neffects of their past evil actions can be neutralized by the effects of \ntheir good actions and by the intercession of divine grace.* \nRepentance is the forerunner of spiritual liberation. It necessarily \nprecedes any sincere and continuous effort to free oneself from evil. \nGreat doctors of souls can inspire metaphysical truants to retrace their \nfootsteps Godward, and support them in the journey; but the actual \nwalking must be done by the error-stricken themselves. By convincing \nthe heart of the folly and misery involved in delusion's nightmares of \nevil actions, the penitent arouses his soul, long held in that nonsensi-\ncal somnolence, and with that awakening power makes a dash for \nspiritual liberty. \n* Remission of sins by the grace of God or a God-knowing saint is discussed in Dis-\ncourse 35. \n572 \n"}

To close theaters and other venues of \nentertainment on the Sabbath would be only a token formality, mean-\ningless unless religionists willingly stay away from materialistic diver-\nsions to spend the day in God-reminding, spiritually rejuvenating activ-\nities. With so many material enticements kept alive on Sabbath days, the \nminds of people run riot. Where is the time for restorative calmness, in-\ntrospection, and creative thinking to adopt the best actions for an all-\nround existence during the coming week? A Sabbath well spent in si-\nlence, meditation, and creative thinking (not frantic reasonings but a \nstilling of thoughts, which are then replaced with intuitive perception) \naffords the soul reinforcement with harmony, peace, and mental and \nphysical strength to use discrimination to develop physically, mentally, \nand spiritually in the best possible way. The inveterate worker who goes \nat it nonstop seven days a week lets his soul become subject to me-\nchanical activity. Such a person loses his ability to govern his activity by \nfree will, discrimination, and peace. He becomes a physical and mental \nwreck, shorn of spiritual happiness. Activity and calmness both must be \ncultivated and kept in balance, one with the other, in order to produce \npeace and happiness during periods of activity as well as silence. \nThe reader may say that to observe the real spirit of the Sabbath \nby spending it in seclusion, fasting, introspection, and meditation is \n585 \n"}

So neither does He keep a clock to determine when the Sabbath \nbegins and ends. The Sabbath is any day or hours of the day of inte-\nrior communion with God, no matter what one is doing exteriorly, so \nthat other days or hours of the day, though filled with life's responsi-\nbilities, may be inwardly converted into a Sabbath by feeling the pres-\nence of God during all activity. This is the spirit of the Sabbath law \nabout which Jesus spoke, in contrast to the rigid literal interpretation \nsimply involving cessation of work.

The teaching of the Bhagavad \nGita about action and nonaction—the \"workless\" state of union with \nSpirit in the vibrationless realm beyond active creation—parallels the \ntrue understanding of inner versus outer observance of the Sabbath:* \n\"Actionlessness is not attained simply by avoiding actions. By forsak-\ning work no one reaches perfection. Verily, no one can stay for even a \nmoment without working; all are indeed compelled to perform actions \nwilly-nilly, prodded by the qualities {gunas) born of Nature (Prakriti). \nThe individual who forcibly controls the organs of action, but whose \nmind rotates around thoughts of sense objects, is said to be a hypocrite, \ndeluding himself. But that man succeeds supremely, O Arjuna, who, \ndisciplining the senses by the mind, unattached, keeps his organs of ac-\ntivity steadfast on the path of God-uniting actions [yoga meditation].\"! \nSo long as man's mind and life force are tied to the senses, he is at \nwork. It is when he learns to switch off the life-force currents in the nerves \nthat connect the mind to the senses that he attains the true inactive state \nof transcendental Spirit. If \"inactivity\" is the measure of proper Sabbath \nobservance, therefore, only the yogi who has reached the savikalpa sa-\nmadhi state, wherein all bodily activity is suspended in the ecstatic \ntrance of God-union, can be truly said to honor that commandment. \nThe Gita points out an even higher state: the ultimate stage of di-\nvine communion, nirvikalpa samadhi, in which the yogi retains his con-\nscious oneness with Spirit without necessarily suspending outer activity. \nPerfectly identified with God as the Sole Doer, he is said to be \"inac-\ntively active\"—his outer bodily instrument engaged in doing the Lord's \nwill, his inner being free of all desire-born entanglement in the world: \n\"He is a yogi, discriminative among men, who beholds inactivity \nin action and action in inaction. He has attained the goal of all actions \n(and is free).\" And, \"Like unto the lotus leaf that remains unsullied by \nwater, the yogi who performs actions, forswearing attachment and \nsurrendering his actions to the Infinite, remains unbound by entan-\nglement in the senses. \n*The word derives from Hebrew shabath, \"to cease to do; to rest.\" \nf God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita 111:4-7. \nX God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita iv:i8 and v:io. \nIn her masterworks The Way of Perfection and The Interior Castle, the renowned \nmystic Saint Teresa of Avila gives a systematic description, from her own personal ex-\n587 \n"}

These in essence correspond ex-\nactly with the progressively higher states of consciousness expounded in India's cen-\nturied, universal soul-science of yoga. \nThe saint describes deepening degrees of God-communion as beginning with the \nvarious forms of vocal and mental prayer, and progressing through the interiorized \nstates of \"infused recollection,\" \"prayer of quiet,\" and \"prayer of union\" which cul-\nminates in perfect oneness with God or \"spiritual marriage.\" \nOf \"the prayer of quiet,\" she writes in The Way of Perfection, trans. E. Allison \nPeers (Garden City, New York: Image Books, 1991): \"In this state all the faculties are \nstilled. The soul, in a way which has nothing to do with the outward senses, realizes \nthat it is now very close to its God, and that, if it were but a little closer, it would be-\ncome one with Him through union.... \n\"The body experiences the greatest delight and the soul is conscious of a deep sat-\nisfaction. So glad is it merely to find itself near the fountain that, even before it has be-\ngun to drink, it has had its fill. There seems nothing left for it to desire. The faculties \nare stilled and have no wish to move, for any movement they may make appears to \nhinder the soul from loving God.\" \nShe goes on to describe three distinct stages of union: simple union, ecstatic union, \nand perfect union (spiritual marriage). Saint Teresa's writings on these exalted states \nhave been summarized as follows by Catholic scholar Albert Farges, in Mystical \nPhe-\nnomena (London: Burns, Oates, and Washbourne, 1926), who writes: \"Whilst in sim-\nple union the senses are more or less asleep, and awake if disturbed; in ecstasy, on the \ncontrary, they are totally suspended, or rather in a state of anaesthesia, to such an ex-\ntent that even violent disturbance will not arouse them. The hand of an ecstatic en-\ngaged in prayer may be approached with the flame of a candle, without his feeling the \nleast pain....[It] is as though the soul were no longer in the body: to such an extent \nthat philosophers and theologians have asked themselves whether, for example, the \nsoul of St. Paul, during his ecstasy, did really cease to animate his body.... \n\"All mystical theologians are agreed in placing, above ecstatic union, a still more \nperfect degree of union, the height of earthly contemplation and a foretaste of eternal \nbeatitude....In it ecstasy may become very rare....As Suarez has remarked, our Lord, \nduring his mortal life, was able to enjoy the beatific vision without ever falling into \nthe swoon of ecstasy....The highest summit of contemplative life here below seems, \nthen, to coincide with freedom from this weakness and natural imperfection of the life \nof the senses; that is to say, with rarity and even complete absence of the swoons of \necstasy.\" (Publisher's \nNote) \n588 \n"}

They help to disseminate his teachings not only through the ex-\nample of their lives but also as ordained teachers, whether serving be-\nhind the scenes in the ashram or in public. The very act of living for \nGod alone is in itself a sermon to the world, eloquent beyond the finest \noratory. The duly ordained teacher who possesses both a holy life and \na clarity in conveying truth is a true \"apostle\" of the master, \"sent \nforth\" to serve for him as a pure voice of his God-given message. \nAs worthy children endeavor to add to their family name prestige \nin the world, so disciples as the spiritual children of a master seek to ex-\ntol his name by the virtue of their lives. When a father brings forth a son \ninto the world, the child inherits by nature and environment the family \ntraits, good or bad.

That is why Jesus, on seeing Si-\nmon, told him, \"Follow me,\" and without hesitation Simon followed \nhim.* Jesus selected his disciples for three reasons: First, because they \nhad not reached, but were near, the final state of realization; and there-\nfore he wanted to assist them in the attainment of perfection. Second, \nafter reawakening their past spiritual potential for reaching the final \nstate of emancipation, Jesus required their assistance as apostles or \nmodel disciples who could be pioneers to propagate the message of \nChristhood to the masses through ideal living.

(3) The tree of consciousness, \nwhich has its roots in the intelligence in the brain; its trunk consists of \nthe mind, and its branches consist of reason, will, and feeling; it bears \nfruits of evil and good desires. As an aggregate, these three systems of \nnerves, life energy, and consciousness constitute the tree of life in man.f \nThe human tree of nerves yields good or bad sensations according \nto the nature of the individual who owns and tends the tree of the nerv-\nous system. When an individual administers polluted waters of evil stim-\nuli to the roots in his brain of this tree of life, he produces fruits of evil \nsensations hanging from the branches of different nerves. That is, when \na person feeds his brain with evil thoughts, howsoever aroused, that \nstimulus in the consciousness creates desire for evil sensations. When \nthose desires are acted upon by the will, the endings of the optical \nbranch nerves, or the auditory, or tactual, or olfactory, or gustatory \nbranches of the nervous system become laden with fruits of evil sensa-\ntions in response to contact with desired objects, such as the wish to see \nunwholesome sights, listen to words of flattery or evil gossip, engage in \nlustful sensations of touch or smell, or indulge an unbridled appetite. \nConversely, a brain that is fed with good thoughts produces good fruit \non the tree of life, from good habits and cravings for good sensations. \nThe roots of every tree of life grow deep in the soil of conscious-\nness to tap the wellspring of Cosmic Consciousness. As such, the hu-\n*Yoga science identifies ten \"senses\" with which the physical body is endowed: five \ninstruments of knowledge (sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch) and five instruments \nof action (the subtle powers behind the bodily faculties of manual skill, locomotion, \nspeech, procreation, and elimination). \nfSee also Discourse 7, the tree of life in the Garden of Eden; and Discourse 10, Nathan-\nael sitting under fig tree. \n610 \n"}

But man, through misuse of his freedom of \nwill, has converted his tree of life into a bearer of fruits of evil sensa-\ntions. Once a nervous system is conditioned to producing desire for \nevil sensations, it is very hard to change its character. A good nervous \nsystem will not easily produce fruits of desire for evil sensations, nor \nwill an evil-inclined tree of life produce of itself fruits in the form of \ndesires for good sensations. \nThe astral tree, whose branches spread subtly throughout the phys-\nical nervous system, is fed by Cosmic Energy. If this astral tree is not im-\npacted by vitiating evil physical habits, it produces fruits of fine inner per-\nception which the advanced devotee can pluck and enjoy. As a person \ncannot partake of the fruits of an undiscovered mango tree hidden in a \ngarden, so a devotee who is yet to see with the light of ecstasy this astral \ntree of life cannot even imagine the enjoyment to be had from its Elysian \nfruits: perceptions of subtle forces; possession of miraculous powers; see-\ning visions, which are true to life; listening to the celestial sounds beyond \nthe reach of human ears, feeling sensations of the bodies of others, in-\nhaling astral fragrance, savoring astral taste; and possession of the power \nto dislodge the astral body from the physical body (and to return at will), \nto magnify or decrease the size of the astral body—these are but a few \nof the wonders of having discovered one's heavenly astral body. \nBehind the tree of astral life is the tree of consciousness. When this \ntree of consciousness is fed with the water of divine thoughts and in-\ntuition springing from the fountain of meditation, it becomes an en-\ntirely good tree bearing only fruits of good desires, spiritual aspira-\ntions, and wisdom. \nHidden beneath these three trees of the physical nervous system, \nof astral life, and of consciousness, is their creator and upholder, the \nsuperconsciousness of the soul. \nSuperconsciousness is rooted in the Cosmic Consciousness of God. \nIt sustains the trunk of the threefold tree of life, as also its branches of \nsuperconscious perception, subconscious perception, and conscious \nperception. Superconsciousness, when perceived, will be found to be \nthe source of the fruits of superconscious intuition and of subconscious \nspiritual dreams and of all good sensations and sentiments. \nOn a macrocosmic scale, God can be spoken of as the root of the \nuniversal tree of life; the Cosmic Energy can be spoken of as the trunk; \nand all rays shooting out of this Cosmic Energy for the creation of uni-\n611 \n"}

However, we have now \nlearned that communication between the heart and brain is actually a dynamic, ongo-\ning, two-way dialogue, with each organ continuously influencing the other's function. \nResearch has shown that the heart communicates to the brain in four major ways: neu-\nrologically (through the transmission of nerve impulses), biochemically \n(via hormones \nand neurotransmitters), biophysically \n(through pressure waves) and \nenergetically \n(through electromagnetic field interactions).

But when they allow a feeling of emo-\ntional closeness or empathy to develop between them, the EEGs begin to resemble each \nother, often to a striking degree. No type of energy or signal can be detected to pass \nbetween the distant individuals. Moreover, the statistical correlations between the dis-\ntant EEG patterns do not diminish when the subjects are moved farther apart. This de-\nfies one of the hallmarks of energy as defined in physics—its decrease in strength with \nincreasing distance from its source. Also, the EEGs remain equally correlated if the sub-\njects are placed in metal-lined boxes, which block ambient electromagnetic energy.... \n\"Grinberg-Zylberbaum's team, along with physicist Amit Goswami, of the Depart-\nment of Physics and the Institute of Theoretical Science at the University of Oregon, pro-\npose that these 'transferred potentials' between brains demonstrate 'brain-to-brain non-\nlocal...correlations....' Nonlocal correlations have been a concern of physicists since they \nwere proposed by Einstein, Rosen, and Podolsky in 1935....They were demonstrated ex-\nperimentally in a celebrated study in 1982 by physicist Alain Aspect and his colleagues. \nPhysicists assumed that nonlocal connections exist only between subatomic particles such \nas electrons and photons.

The Son of \nGod, the inner Christ, was completely detached from the actions of the \nson of man, the external personality of Jesus.

Every individual is unique unto himself; no two vi-\nbratory expressions are identical, for each one's thoughts, choices, and \nreactions in the school of life are his own.

Even deeper is the supercon-\nscious mind, which never forgets anything a person ever does, in this \nor prior incarnations.

If his will is weakened by discouragement \nand absorbs that suggestion, he may again succumb to error. There-\nfore the psychology of forgiveness consists in helping the wrongdoer \nto remove permanently the mask of evil from his soul by encouraging \nin him the cultivation of good karma. \nThough one should not hold unforgiving feelings in his heart, nei-\nther should he express forgiveness to a wrongdoer who does not truly \nrepent of his evil actions; otherwise it would only justify to him de-\nliberate repetition of his evil behavior.

There is an exceptional metaphysical technique by which great \nmasters and advanced yogis can do away with the accumulated traces \nof many, many lives of binding karmic actions. When such an ad-\nvanced soul in the ecstasy of deep meditation identifies his conscious-\nness with God, he changes his status from a human being with karma \nto a perfect image of God or divine soul. But unless he is completely \nliberated, he has to revert to human status when he comes down from \nhis meditative ecstasy. So the law of karma with its determinative judg-\nment comes to bring punishment to the temporarily changed individ-\nual. But that individual says to the intelligent law: \"You can't punish \nme for the faults of a human being who through delusion I dreamed I \nwas before. By wisdom I have regained consciousness of my true Self, \na perfect image of God free from the chains of karma.\" But the law of \nkarma insists: \"Whether you are a master now or were an ordinary \nhuman being before, you are still the same individualized being and \ntherefore must pay for your uncompensated past human karma.\" \nThe master, finding himself thus confronted, adopts an ingenious \nmethod to \"pay up\" and satisfy all karmic debt against himself. The \nmaster or yogi enters a state of soul realization and finds in the ar-\nchives of his superconsciousness exactly all binding karmic traces of \nhis past actions. He then proceeds to work them out in one or two or \nmany bodies, which he creates in a vision—a true-to-life experience. \nFor example, if for five incarnations the yogi led a worldly life in \nwhich material habits were not overcome or desires were yet unful-\nfilled, in his vision he creates five bodies which undergo the necessary \nexperiences and play out the parts of those five different lives in a mat-\nter of hours. Then the master says to the law of karma: \"There in the \nvision, by the intensity of my concentration and divine consciousness, \nI have experienced in the materialized five lives all results of my karma; \nnow I am free.\" \nAs soon as the karmic effects of evil actions have been manifested \nand experienced, whether in a self-created conscious dream or vision \nin a few minutes or hours, or in the ordinary events of life in a num-\nber of years, the karmic law has been satisfied and the penitent man \nis \"forgiven,\" freed from that particular karmic debt. \nSouls who are bound by ignorance do not learn the redeeming les-\nson of an experience even when it is repeated several times during \nmany years—or lives! But the wise man by deep concentration attains \nrealization of the truth in an experience in a few minutes. \n661 \n"}

Occasionally, highly developed souls, by the \nsame method, can offer their advanced consciousness to work out \nkarma of others in a condensed, accelerated, manner. \n5. There is a fifth way by which great masters can work out the \ntraces of their actions when they have also taken onto themselves the \nkarma of others. Masters and saviors such as Jesus can offer their bod-\nies to experience not only their own karma but also the karma of oth-\ners to help them toward liberation. The crucifixion of Jesus informs \nus of one such example. Jesus was not crucified by the will of God to \nfulfill some dramatic cosmic plan. His suffering on the cross was due \nto some of his own actions and the taking onto himself of some of the \nconsequences of the sinful actions of his disciples and followers. Jesus \nknew that his preaching the truth in defiance of political authority and \nagainst the canons and traditions of religion would inevitably attract \nthe karma of death; in his incarnate work, he had created a cause that \nwould by the law and purview of the times command a fatal conse-\nquence. He also knew that by forgiving the evil actions of his disciples \nand others he had taken on their karmic debt which he would have to \npay with suffering in his own body. He consciously, for the sake of \nhighest gain in God-consciousness for himself and others and for \nworking out the karma of himself and others, permitted his body to \nbe crucified. By that supreme sacrifice, he was freed from the cosmic \nconstraints of his mortal incarnation and regained immortality for \nhimself and others. On the higher plane of his immortality and om-\nnipresence, Jesus, as a world savior, as with other saviors and great \nmasters, continues his mission of redeeming souls. \nIt is evident there is much involved regarding the forgiving of sins \nby God and by the advanced consciousness of man. \nThe salient consolation is that every human being has absolute \nsurety about his final emancipation if he tries his utmost to help re-\ndeem himself. Man is essentially and eternally made in the image of \nGod; the sins of a million lives cannot erase the perfection of his soul. \nThere is no reason why he should continue an existence of ignorance \nand suffering.

Immanent in the Holy Ghost is the conscious reflection of \nDeity, the Christ Intelligence, by which that Cosmic Vibratory Power is \nguided to evolve all manifestations of goodness in the world. The con-\nscious Satanic Power spawns and directs the evil forces of the world, fight-\nAhriman), the Evil, or Destructive, Spirit. The demons are in constant battle with \nAhura Mazda (later called Ormazd), the Good Lord. \n\"The hierarchy of demons in Judaism, which is rooted in ancient Middle Eastern \nand Zoroastrian demonology after the postexilic period (after 538 BC), is quite varied. \nThe prince of the forces of evil (Hebrew shedim, meaning 'demons' and applied to for-\neign gods, or se'irim, meaning 'hairy demons'), who often were believed to inhabit \ndesert wastes, ruins, and graves and to inflict humanity with various physical, psycho-\nlogical, and spiritual disorders, was called by different names: Satan (the Antagonist), \nBelial (the spirit of perversion, darkness, and destruction), Mastema (Enmity, or Oppo-\nsition), and other names. Though the Old Testament refers to Satan as the prosecutor \nof God's celestial court (Zech. 3; Job 1 - 2 ) , a hierarchy of demons under Satan or other \nprinces of evil was developed in intertestamental literature and later Judaism. \n\"The hierarchy of demons in Christianity is based on various sources: Jewish, \nZoroastrian, Gnostic (a syncretistic religious dualistic-belief system in which matter is \nviewed as evil, the spirit good, and salvation as being attainable through esoteric \nknowledge, or gnosis), and the indigenous religions that succumbed to Christian mis-\nsionizing. In the New Testament, Jesus speaks of Beelzebub as the chief of demons and \nequates him with Satan. In the European Middle Ages and the Reformation period, \nvarious hierarchies of demons were developed, such as that associated with the seven \ndeadly sins: Lucifer (pride), Mammon (avarice), Asmodeus (lechery), Satan (anger), \nBeelzebub (gluttony), Leviathan (envy), and Belphegor (sloth). \n\"The Islamic hierarchy of demons is headed by Iblis (the devil), who also is called \nShaytan (Satan) or 'aduw Allah ('Enemy of God'). Based to a great extent on Jewish \nand Christian demonology, Iblis became the leader of a host of jinn, spiritual beings \nthat generally bode evil. \n\"In Hinduism, the asuras are the demons who oppose the devas (the gods). Among \nthe various classes of asuras are nagas (serpent demons), Ahi (the demon of drought), \nand Kamsa (an archdemon). Demons that afflict humans include the raksasas (grotesque \nbeings who haunt cemeteries, impel the performance of foolish acts, and attack sadhus \n(saintly men) and pishacas (beings who haunt places where violent deaths have occurred). \n\"Buddhists often view their demons as forces that inhibit the achievement of Nir-\nvana (bliss, or the extinction of desire); an important example is Mara, an arch tempter, \nwho, with his daughters, Rati (Desire), Raga (Pleasure), and Tanha (Restlessness), at-\ntempted to dissuade Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, from achieving his enlighten-\nment. As Mahayana (Greater Vehicle) Buddhism spread to Tibet, China, and Japan, \nmany of the demons of the folk religions of these areas (e.g., the Chinese \nkuei-shen; \nthe Japanese oni) were incorporated into Buddhist beliefs.\" \n671 \n"}

In that sense, man participates actively in the per-\npetuation of evil.

Man negates his lordship by faulty, \nself-serving stewardship of his earthly environment. He guides nature, \nthough usually unknowingly, not only by his actions but also by the vi-\nbrations of his thoughts.

Like a powerful X-ray of en- personages \nergy, it had burned out her pernicious disease. As a \ndiseased person touching the electrodes of an electrical medical appa-\nratus may be benefited by the stimulus of the current, so the woman \ndesiring healing made contact with the magnetism of Jesus and rein-\nforced the impaired life force in her own body with the subtle aura, or \nastral current, emanating from and surrounding his body. \nIn the cure of every diseased human body, medicine or mental \nhealing only rouses and supplements the inert life force, the direct \ncause of healing. A sick person can energize his healing life force by \nhis will power revived by the strong will of a healer, or the sick per-\nson may by faith draw life force from a divinely magnetic individual's \nbody and thereby rouse and reinforce his own all-healing life force to \neffect the healing. It was the latter case that caused Jesus to say, \"Some \nsubtle faith, seeking healing, has touched my astral emanation by an \nastral hand and has withdrawn virtue, or life force, from me.\" \n*Cf. parallel references in Matthew 9 : 1 8 - 2 2 and Mark 5 : 2 1 - 3 4 . \nSee also Mark 6 : 5 3 - 5 6 (and its parallel in Matthew 1 4 : 3 4 - 3 6 ) , which cite simi-\nlar instances of healing: \"And when they had passed over, they came into the land of \nGennesaret, and drew to the shore.

Both are necessary. Healers must be sure of the presence \nof these two factors in divine healing—the faith of the person desir-\ning to be healed and the ability of the healer to charge himself with di-\nvine healing power by daily deep God-contact in meditation. The \nvirtue, or conscious cosmic energy that Jesus always felt within him-\nself and that emanated from him, was absorbed by the faith of the \nwoman, producing healing in her. It is noted in the Gospel that in \nJesus' own country, some people could not be healed of their sickness \nbecause they were too material to receive the blessing of the omnipo-\ntent consciousness of God manifested in him.* \nWhen Jesus felt \"virtue is gone out of me,\" he expressed the prin-\nciple of darshan in which a divine personage, with or without conscious \nintention, bestows blessings on those who approach the indwelling Di-\nvinity with a pure heart and mind. Receptive devotees thereby attract \ninstant blessings from the mere sight or touch of a holy person. \nDoubt is insidious static that disturbs the reception of the vibra-\ntion of healing, no matter how strong the power of the healer.

Of course, charlatans may quote scripture to serve their own \nnefarious ends; but Jesus knew he was the promised Messiah, the Christ, \nspoken of by the holy ones of centuries past. In his \nThe Christ in Jesus ful- \nmeek way, Jesus read the words of Isaiah to declare \nfilled Isaiah's prophecy that he was not an ordinary religious teacher, but \nof healing and \nwas chosen and empowered by the Lord, \"He hath \nsalvation \nanointed me,\" for a preordained mission.* \n\"The Spirit of the Lord (the Infinite Intelligence \nof Christ Consciousness, which directs all creation) is upon my soul,\" not \nthrough symbolical baptism with water by man, but through immersion \nin the Ocean of Spirit. When one restores his mortally identified soul to \nunion with the infinite Spirit, he is baptized with illimitable spiritual wis-\ndom and thus can ably and fittingly \"preach the Gospel,\" the intuitively \nperceived truths of God, \"to the poor,\" to humble recipient minds. \nLikewise, only God-saturated souls can permanently \"heal the \nbrokenhearted\"—human hearts sorely wounded with disillusionment \nand despair by dependence on treacherous expectations of material \nsatisfaction. As immortals, souls are sent on earth to be entertained by \nthe Lord's cosmic drama; but when delusion captures and holds man's \nconsciousness with its subtle nuances of pretense, the divine nature \nloses itself in identification with the physical form and its love of ma-\nterial pleasures. Matter can never satisfy spirit; sooner or later this is \na hard-won realization. Then God-knowing souls come to the rescue \nof the brokenhearted by illuminating the way of return to the imper-\nishable happiness of Spirit hidden within one's own soul. \nGod-empowered souls, attuned with the Source of all power, can \nrestore sight to the sightless, by exercising matter-controlling Divine \nWill to remodel the disorganized atoms in a blind man's eyes, and also \nbring \"recovery of sight\" to the spiritually blind. \n*The word Christ (as also Messiah) literally means \"the Anointed.\" \n786 \n"}

Sensory-\ndependent reason from immediate observation or from memory con-\nditioned by repeated past experiences can blunder if the sensory ob-\nservation or experience is faulty or incomplete. \nGod has no senses, nor reason dependent on sensory perceptions; \nHe Himself is the Knower, the process of knowing, and the wisdom to \nbe known. He knows the truth about all things through His cosmic in-\ntuition, His feeling present in everything. Likewise do His true devotees, \nbeing in tune with the Spirit of their Heavenly Father, depend on the un-\nlimited power and guidance of intuitive God-perception and not on lim-\nited reason when confronted with persecutions or human problems. \nIn the context of the reference in Luke cited above ( 2 1 : 1 4 - 1 5 ) , as \nalso in St. John (14:26), Jesus assures his disciples of his intercession \nin times of need: '\"I will give you a mouth and wisdom'—you will feel \nmy spirit of Christ Consciousness with you, manifesting in 'the Com-\nforter, which is the Holy Ghost...he shall teach you all things.\"' \n\"And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the \nfather the child: and the children shall rise up against their par-\nents, and cause them to be put to death.

They actually \nlived the truth, and thus by their spiritual examples and instrumental-\nity did great good to mankind by healing bodies of physical and men-\ntal diseases and souls of ignorance. \nAnd the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and \ntold him all things, both what they had done, and what they \nhad taught. And he said unto them, \"Come ye yourselves apart \ninto a desert place, and rest a while\": for there were many com-\ning and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat (Mark \n6:30-31). \nn the return of the apostles from their successful journeys, Jesus \npointed out that preachers of truth should always be equipped \nwith divine consciousness. They should condition themselves in med-\nitation so that they are steeped in God before going out to spread the \ngospel; and when they feel themselves spiritually depleted after active \nperiods of teaching others, they should again retire to quiet places and \nrecharge themselves through God-contact in meditation before they \nresume their ministry. \nAnd the seventy returned again with joy, saying, \"Lord, even the \ndevils are subject unto us through thy name.\" \nAnd he said unto them, \"I beheld Satan as lightning fall from \nheaven.

Behold, I give you di-\nvine power by which you will be able to conquer Satan and his min-\nions; by overcoming delusion, nothing shall in any way harm you. \nThrough my Christ Consciousness, I will give you the will power by \nwhich you shall be able to control the coiled serpent force at the base \nof the spine. The creative life force flowing outward into the body feeds \nsexual desires and 'scorpions' of tormenting, poisonous, evil instincts. \nWhen you master the technique of withdrawing the coiled serpent force \nupward through the awakened astral centers in the spine to the celes-\ntial astral region in the cerebrum, then you will have full self-control \nover the unruly passions of sex and all evil desires that obstruct the at-\ntainment of divine bliss. Be less elated that you have power to control \nevil spirits and evil forces in healing others, and rather rejoice more that \nyour souls have attained a sufficient degree of Self-realization to access \nthe heavenly region of Cosmic Consciousness.\" \nAs was explained in previous verses,* Satan was originally an \narchangel, an intelligent force of God's creative cosmic energy, en-\ndowed with power to create in tune with Divine Intelligence perfect \nheavenly manifestations in material creation. This force came out of \nMaha-Prakriti, Great Nature, the Holy Ghost, the primal creative as-\npect of Spirit. The informing power of the Mother of Creation is \nmaya, cosmic delusion, that transforms the One Spirit into myriad \nmanifestations. With a thin veil of maya, Prakriti's pure nature, Para-\nPrakriti, works in harmony with God's reflected Christ-Kutastha In-\ntelligence to produce the divine laws and forces informing all mani-\nfestations of the heavenly astral-causal realms. A denser pall of cosmic \ndelusion was required to generate the gross vibrations necessary to \nbeget a sustained material creation from this underlying astral-causal \n* See Discourse 7. \n798 \n"}

Because these gross vibrations of cosmic delusion distort and \neclipse the true nature of matter as made of God's consciousness, this \noutflowing creative power is referred to as Prakriti's impure nature, \nApara-Prakriti. It is this aspect to which Satan is equated, depicted as \nan archangel fallen from divine grace, a creative force not guided by \nheavenly vibrations—a force that rebelled against God-consciousness, \nobscuring the Innate Divinity, in order to preserve his own kingdom \nof humankind through self-perpetuating misuse of free will. \nThus, heaven is not only transcendental Cosmic Consciousness, \nbut also that region of manifestation in which the pure Cosmic Intel-\nligent Energy works in tune with the creative will of Cosmic Con-\nsciousness, God the Father of Creation. And the sphere of space in \nwhich there is the creation and presence of imperfect manifestations is \nthe field wherein the conscious cosmic force of Satan, the energy fallen \nfrom heavenly attunement into deception, spawns tantalizing delu-\nsions of bondage to oppose the hidden essence of the intercessional, \nliberating works of the pure Divine Intelligence. \nSimilarly, in the human body there is the transcendent and heavenly \nregion and the region of delusion or satanic influence. The heavenly re-\ngion extends from the astral dorsal or heart center up to the transcen-\ndental cerebral center of Spirit. The region of satanic influence and the \nreceptacle of baser instincts extends from below the heart, through the \nlumbar, sacral, and coccygeal centers (notwithstanding that when these \nvery centers are spiritualized by meditation and righteous action, their \nsoul-attuned functions then aid the devotee, respectively, with self-\ncontrol, adherence to spiritual observances, and resistance to untoward \nsensory temptations).* When the energy from the senses is concentrated \nby meditation in the divine astral center in the brain, the devotee is spo-\nken of as having attained heaven. But in most people, those who do not \nmeditate nor behave in harmony with their soul qualities, their con-\nsciousness is tied to the life force flowing downwards, falling from the \nheavenly astral cerebral region to the region of the senses. \nThe satanic or delusive force in every human being keeps the \nlightning-like life force continuously descending toward the senses, al-\nlowing the searchlight of sensory perceptions to reveal the attraction \nof sense objects only.

It is good to have knowl-\nedge befitting a professor in preference to a doltish brain of an igno-\nrant man; but if one's intellect is so complacent in its scholastic dis-\ntinction that one feels no need to seek wisdom in God, the evolution \nof that soul is laggardly compared to an illiterate who has devotion to \nthe Lord. By drawing his disciples from among the common populace \n—even \"publicans and sinners\" and unlettered fishermen such as Pe-\nter, James, and John—Jesus showed that it was possible for any devo-\ntee to attain divine realization, for God is not a respecter of persons \nas to their status. As the little and big fingers equally belong to one's \nhand, so all souls—whether or not they are significant in the eyes of \nthe world—belong to God. Whoever approaches Him with pure de-\nvotion will attain Him. \nGod reveals Himself unto those who completely surrender them-\nselves unto Him, those who have no intellectual or emotional resis-\ntance to Him. Before God, the most accomplished of humans is but a \nchild; even the most brilliant scientist does not know why or how God \ncreated this world. The Lord is not interested in how much one \nknows, but in how much one loves Him. The only way to touch Him \nis by the ardent devotion of the heart. \nJesus lauded the childlike qualities of his disciples over the \"wise \nand prudent\" who loved to use their erudition and logic to find fault \nwith his teachings. A closed-minded critical attitude is spiritually stul-\ntifying. Attunement with the guru through devotion enables the devo-\ntee to progress steadily toward God-realization; doubters and habit-\nual criticizers fall by the wayside.
