C., that an immigration \nofficial became sarcastically fascinated with my yellow turban, the national headdress of \nthe Hindus. The officer looked at me with pity and said, \"Do you gaze at crystals, tell \nfortunes, swallow swords? Are you a snake charmer?\" I said nothing but presented him \nwith one of my books, and when he had read a few lines and had a look of apology in his \neye for his rash inference, I looked at him smilingly and said, \"Dear officer, did you \nknow that the Hindus never had any factory where they knew the art of making crystals? \nCrystals are of western origin. Hence it is news to me that the Hindus gaze at crystals. \n\"As regards fortune telling, you have quite a number right here in America as well as in \nIndia. But whenever you meet an American gentleman do you ask him, \"Are you a \nfortune teller?\" Every Hindu is not a fortune teller. They don't believe in flattering an \nunmarried woman by telling her fortune, saying that she is going to have a good wealthy \nhusband, and then relieve her of three or four dollars. Wise Hindus can teach you how to \nsolve the problem of life. Your present poverty or opulence, disease or health, is brought \nabout by your own past actions. Your present life will determine your future life. They \ndiagnose scientifically how the law of cause and effect apply to human actions and lives. \nThey do not believe in fate, i.e., anything happening without cause. Hence the Hindus do \nnot like fooling people by telling them what is going to happen through the trickery of \nimagination, equivocal words, or by fraud. The real Hindu astrologers make a scientific \nstudy of the law of causation governing human actions and they are not satisfied with \ntelling you the past or predicting your future only. They teach you the art of averting an \nunwelcome event or stimulating the fruition of a desirable event coming to you as a result \nof your past evil or good actions. Good astrologers tell their students only what will \nbenefit them, and do not like to satisfy idle curiosity. They say there is no use in telling \nyou what is coming to you anyway unless one can also show you the way to control or \nregulate your self-created destiny. Otherwise ignorance is bliss.\" \nI said to the immigration officer again, \"Sir, I haven't had the singular, dangerous \nexperience of swallowing swords or taming cobras, which our wonderful street magicians \noften do in open daylight before the gaze of people.\" These snake charmers and sword \nswallowers are our street magicians. They are skilled in slight-of-hand tricks at the same \ntime. They do perform magic by producing optical illusions. Herein the eastern magician \nis superior to the western magician.\" \nThen smilingly I asked the officer again, \"I have seen some hypocritical western people \nwearing hats and dress suits, but I never connected hypocrisy with the wearing of hats. \nHow did you happen to connect snake-charming with my turban?\" \n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - Miracles Of Raja Yoga (8p).pdf", "page": 2, "text": " \n2\nBy this time the officer was smoothed out and in a very friendly tone he said, \"I am sorry. \nMany good turbaned Hindus have to suffer the persecution of public opinion because \nsome turbaned Hindu fakers have produced a wrong impression on our people.\" \nI replied, \"Well, but you cannot expect all Hindus to forsake turbans because some \nHindus have not done right, just as I cannot expect all western brothers to forsake their \nhats because some practiced hypocrisy while wearing hats. Western tourists go to India \nand watch our poorly dressed coolie laborers, and see the performances of the street \nmagicians or fakers, and they think the Hindus need to wear swallow-tail coats and \nneckties to be civilized. Well, you can dress a cow with a swallow-tail coat and necktie, \nbut that would not make it civilized. Neither would a turbaned cow dressed in a robe \nbecome a spiritual Hindu.\" \nCustoms and mannerisms are non-essentials resulting from certain climatic influences. \nThe real development of man consists of the development of his mind-power. \nSo the American tourist visiting India must take care not to misconceive the real Yogis of \nIndia. The real Yogis are distinctly different from the magicians, sword-swallowers, \ninstantaneous mango tree growers. The latter are our magicians and street entertainers. \nThe former are Great Men, very difficult to recognize due to Their child-like simplicity, \nyet possessing miraculous powers like those of Christ. \nPhysical and Mental Miracles \nThere is no difference between physical laws and super-laws or miracles worked by the \nknowledge of the mechanism of the human mind. The Americans work miracles through \nuse of physical laws; the Hindus work mental miracles. The operation of radio and tele-\nphoto cameras are still miracles to many Hindus, and the workable miracles of the mind \n...so often displayed by the Yogis of India are unknown to the Americans. In these days \nof marvels of constant inventions it would be wise for the Americans to at least \ninvestigate thoroughly the discovery of spiritual miracles by their Hindu brothers. \nMiracles are nothing but the operation of super-mental and cosmic laws. Jesus and the \nmaster-minds of India know how to operate them. To ordinary people such work appears \nas miracles, but they are really the result of the natural operation of certain higher, hidden \nlaws. \nNeed for Raja Yoga \nYoga means uniting Mind-Power with Cosmic Power. Raja Yoga consists of those \nprinciples of concentration which were easily practiced even by the Rajas or royalists of \nIndia who were engrossed with the multifarious duties of their states. \nThese methods of concentration, or Raja Yoga, which bring power over one's own \ndestiny and which can turn failure—material, moral, social or spiritual—into success \n...can fit in with the busy and worried life of the American Rajas and Maharajahs, the \nAmerican millionaires and billionaires. Human nature is everywhere the same. The \n"}

The \nAmerican, because he makes the machine work hard for him, has more time than the \nHindu, who has to work with his hands for his living. The American business man has \nmore time than the proverbially spiritual Hindu to devote to developing mental miracles. \nThe superiority of acquiring miraculous mental powers over the acquirement of business \nskill is this, that the former has no limitations, whereas the latter has. The ordinary \nintelligent business man may be broken down by hard competition. When his business \nintelligence is exhausted he utterly fails. But the Hindu savant says that when your \nintelligence gives out you don't need to give up. One can use his unlimited super-powers \nfor the materialization of a desire. As God is all-powerful, so also, by Raja-Yoga, or \nuniting with Him consciously, man becomes likewise powerful. \nMiracles Historically Recorded \nI will give below a few authentic, historically true, miraculous achievements of the Yogis \nof India ...showing that they lived far ahead of the modern times and performed miracles \nstill far remote from even the comprehension of modern material science. \nAbout seventy years ago, the holy city of Benares was agog with the miracles of Tailanga \nSwami. He was two hundred fifty years old, and it is said He used to remain below or \nfloating on the surface of the Ganges two or three days at a time; He read peoples' minds \nlike books; He drank poisonous liquids by bowlfuls without dying, and seemingly had \ndone all the miracles of Jesus Christ. The story goes that once, for disregarding the laws \nof the city, He was put in jail. He was seen the next minute walking on the roof. He had \nmany wonderful powers. Can science tell us of anyone else who has lived for two \nhundred and fifty years? \nThe Miracle of Sadhu Haridas \nAnother miracle of Raja Yoga was demonstrated when Sadhu Haridas permitted Himself \nto be buried alive under-ground for five months. In the sixteenth century, in the court of \nPrince Ranjit Singh—emperor of the Punjab—and under the seal of French and other \nEuropean doctors, the miraculous performance of Sadhu Haridas was historically \nrecorded. The emperor buried this Saint Haridas (after waxing the body all over and then \nsewing it in a sack which was then sealed in a stone chest) several hundred feet below the \nearth in his own courtyard for five months. Millions of people waited for the news about \nthe Saint when He was disinterred after five months had passed. The stone chest was \nopened, the clothing and wax were removed, and the body was examined by French and \nEnglish doctors and pronounced dead. Yet in a few minutes the Saint Sadhu Haridas \nblinked His eyes and came back to life. Boom! went the cannon from the ramparts of the \nemperor's fort at Lahore (Punjab, India), heralding and declaring that the Saint Haridas \nhad come back to life. Millions witnessed this event, and in any comprehensive historical \nbook on India this occurrence will be found recorded. \n"}

My teacher's teacher gave a demonstration similar to that mentioned above, to my \nmother. But it is considered a spiritual degradation and blasphemy against God's laws for \ngreat Yogis to give such above demonstrations merely to satisfy the idle cravings of \ncuriosity-seekers. \nIt took me a long time to understand my Master and His miraculous power, though I had \nclose contact with Him. I have seen miracles, and of all the wonderful things witnessed, I \nshall declare to the world that I secured my A.B. degree through this miraculous power. I \nused to always visit and stay with Him, and neglected my college work so much that I \nhardly knew where my college books were. Two days before the university examination, \nI told my Master I wasn't going to appear at the examination. His demeanor changed \nsuddenly and He said, \"Then all My relations with you cease this instant.\" He insisted \nand said, \"All I ask of you is to appear at the examination.\" He declared I would pass \neven though I had not studied. I agreed reluctantly, thinking I would write about His \nteachings in the answer paper to questions on the writing of Shakespeare. I just agreed \nliterally to carry out His behest. \nNext He asked me, at first gently, then vehemently, to go to a certain friend of mine and \nask certain questions of him every morning of all those days that my A.B. examination \nlasted. This Calcutta University A.B. degree, in some respects, is more difficult to obtain \nthan a Harvard A.B. degree. There is so much injustice and difficulty set in the path of \nthose being examined. I did as my Master told me; and strange to say, whatever questions \nthis friend of mine unconsciously told me to prepare for, I found those very questions in \nmy examinations. After the first day I declared to the world that I was going to pass, and \nwhen I received the A.B. degree, my parents and friends, who had given up all hopes \nabout the success of my college life, told me I had performed a miracle. That is why I am \nfond of putting the A.B. after my name in all my books and articles. The A.B. title \nreminds me of this singular experience. When I questioned my Master, Sri Yukteswar \nGiriji, He just replied that faith, works and knowledge of super-mental law can work \nmiracles, where physical efforts of man fail. \nI remember that a friend of mine, seeing me a devout follower of my Master and \nnegligent of my studies, had once ridiculed me and said, \"I am sorry to tell you that your \nMaster and God won't make you pass your examinations.\" And half in faith and half for \nthe sake of argument, I replied, \"Why not?\" Little did I dream I would see the fulfillment \nof my saying later on. \nMy Master is still living in flesh and blood in India and I dare not tell all the wonderful \nthings I have seen. This much I can say: throughout the whole western world I have not \nfound a single one like Him. I would accept all the poverty, famine, and inconveniences \nof life in India ....in preference to the comfortable American life, just to sit at the feet of \none like my Master. Americans who are good listeners and love real progress now ought \nto go deeper than mere listening to the philosophical message of India's spiritual science. \nThey should learn the technique by which the super-miracles of the mind can be \n"}

That has been mostly your worst calamity. The unwelcome habits that \ncame earliest in you life have kept you quite busy now and have crowded out many worth-while \nthings of life. The social world moves on the wheels of certain habits. Few realize whither the \nsocial machinery is headed—to the chasm of ignorance or towards the mire of petty \nengagements, which choke the steady progressive activities of life. \nHow many times card and dancing parties, over-gorged amusement hunger, time-killing, \nprogress-murdering mental idleness, initiativelessness, ambitionlessness ...have stood in your \nway and persuaded you to ignore and break your engagement with worth-while objects of life, \neven though you are fastidiously punctual in keeping daily engagements with useless doings. \nWhen an overdose of drugging sleep makes you lazy and a late riser on Sunday mornings you \nforget your real engagement. On late waking you find the delaying-to-dress habit stands in your \nway, beckoning you not to go out of your home, and you easily break your engagement with the \nspiritually-stimulating atmosphere of the temple or church. \nYour business engagements are important, and for them you sacrifice your equally important \nengagements of daily physical exercise, or of bathing the nerves and mind with showers of peace \nby meditation. \nEvenness of Development \nJust because your business engagements have been considered most important, they have always \ncome first in your consideration. And they yet remain most important and they will remain so \nuntil you are called away in the Mystery beyond. But I preach evenness of development and of \ndemonstrating prosperity—I do not believe in the spiritual sense being drugged and \nchloroformed by business madness or any kind of madness. Many think that unless one is \"at it\" \nday and night he is going to be left behind. That is not true. The one-sided business-bent man, \nforgetful of his other duties of life, is not the truly successful man. It requires greater and greatest \nskill to live life evenly, rightly and successfully. He who only keeps engagement with money is \nleft behind by God. Yet God talks to us very loudly through the pangs of hunger which He has \ngiven us so that we should get busy and make money to support our physical bodies. Yet it \nseems that just maintaining our physical bodies by using up all our mental powers is not the goal \nof life. There is little difference between eating food from a gold plate or an iron plate. The food \nin both cases is equally satisfying to hunger. Then why concentrate on unnecessary \"necessities\" \nor go on constantly multiplying self-created, useless desires for more? To create such \n"}

The height of contrast is reached when we find some Western ladies wearing shoes \nwith fifty dollars’ worth of jewel-studded heels—and most of the Eastern women going wholly \nwithout shoes amidst clay and rain and maybe catching cold. \nOver activity vs. Idleness \nIn the West many factories close due to competition and over-production, and the East suffers \nfrom want of factories. In the West the people are too busy finding the will-o’-the-wisp of \ncomfort; in the East some people try to preserve comfort by not being very active and by \ndreading material activity, which produces laziness. Comfort can only be acquired by a balanced \nattitude, a self-mastery which makes it possible for one to be comfortably active and actively \ncomfortable. Engagements with Over-activity and Mr. Idleness both lead to misery. It is high \ntime for the modern man to shake his drowsiness of centuries and systematize his life. The \nprimitive man led a wild life in everything. The modern man has learned to apply science, \npsychology and system to his business, which are nothing but devices for his material comfort. \nThe real man ought to apply the system and science to make his health, prosperity, social and \ninternational-world life and wisdom ...better and of scientific certainty. In order to do that he \nmust not give all his time to business, which only ensures the hope of physical comfort. How \npeople forget that increase in cost of living too luxuriously ...means the corresponding increase \nin using too much nerve and brain energy, expenditure of longevity ...to gain the conditions of a \nluxurious life! Besides, most people become so engrossed and engaged in making money that \nthey cannot utilize the conditions of comfort after acquiring them. \nSystematize and schedule your engagements—let none, especially your bad habits, sway or \ninfluence your judgment. Let the secretary of your true judgment arrange your life’s daily \nitinerary. \nCulture Habit of Meditation \nYour engagement with business is important, but your appointment of serving others is more \nimportant, and your engagement with Meditation, Home, God and Truth is most important. \nDon’t say you are too busy with worries and cares of keeping the wolf from the door to get time \nfor the culture of Heavenly qualities. \nBreak your self-satisfied, immovable old dogged bad habits ...of idolizing your less important \nengagements and utterly ignoring the most important engagement with Wisdom. No one else will \nanswer for your actions, though others often become instruments in keeping you enmeshed in \nuseless frivolities and so-called important engagements. \n"}

Today’s practice will stimulate the desire to meditate tomorrow \ndeeper, whereas this day’s negligence will weaken your craving. Do not be lured by bad habits \nand paltry useless-vanity-engagements into crowding out God-contact. \nThe world creates in you bad habits, but the world will not stand responsible for your actions \nspringing from those habits. Then why give all the time to the world? Reserve even an hour a \nday for actual soul to soul God-realization. Doesn’t the Giver of the world itself, of your family, \nmoney and everything, deserve one twenty-fourth part of your time? \nYour greatest and most important engagement is with God and seeking His Truth through the \neyes of wisdom and daily discipline! \nRECIPES—By Swami Yogananda \nIntellectual Recipe \nBefore starting to read always select logically written books which deal with vital subjects that \nwill benefit your life. Read a little poetry every day. That will keep your feelings exercised. Read \na little from modern physical science, study a little medical science and hygiene and add to these \na little study of some book that will make you laugh. This will serve as a mental appetizer and \nwill quicken the flow of your intellectual saliva. \nIntellect can be developed by the habit of daily mental exercise in reading and thinking over \ncertain logical philosophical statements. Finding out your own views, after you have read a good \nbook, is of inestimable value in assimilating true ideas. \nIf you mix sand and sugar together it is difficult for a man to separate them while eating, but in a \nmixture of sugar and sand the ant always gets the sugar and leaves the sand alone. \nThe blind reader, who swallows good and bad ideas indiscriminately, suffers from intellectual \nindigestion, chaos, and mental irritation, whereas the introspective reader, like the ant, separates \nthe erroneous harmful or too sentimental views from beneficial and right expressions in the \nbooks he reads. \nSo select quality in the books you read, and above all discriminate and examine the salient \nstatements in them as you read. Remember you are not a mental machine of recording others’ \nideas. Assimilate only the worthy ideas in books. \nSuccess Recipe \n"}

Use your will power and creative \nbrain specially to create new success. Most of us follow the beaten track. It is the new energetic \nexplorer on the pathway of success who succeeds. \nSpiritual Recipe \nIf you read fifteen minutes, write twenty minutes, introspect thirty minutes and meditate thirty-\nfive, you will be spending your time according to the grades of importance of your work. \nHealth Recipe \nEating three meals a day is an extremely dangerous habit. Many are being led to their graves \nquickly because they eat at the sound of the dinner bell. Ignore its ominous call if you are not \nhungry. It is good to eat at a regular time, for a psychological expectancy is created in the body \ncells which helps the secretion of the digestive juices. The intelligent cells like hungry animals at \nthe Zoo wait for the dinner hour. But never eat unless you are hungry. Eat moderately, if you are \nhungry. Eat less if you are a little hungry. Eat nothing if you are not hungry at all. Omit the \nmeals which you may try to eat with little hunger and this will sharpen your hunger for the next \nmeal. Use your will power to resist the temptation of eating three meals every day, by which the \nwhole system, including the cells, the heart, the nerves, the stomach, has to work continuously. \nGive your intelligent machine occasional rest by cutting off breakfast, lunch or dinner every day. \nIf you are very hungry and are working hard, you may safely eat three light meals daily, but if \nyou don’t do much manual labor, then two meals a day are plenty. \nRaw Vegetable Cutlet \nOne head of very finely chopped lettuce, two tablespoonfuls of finely ground pecans, three \ntablespoonfuls of cottage cheese, a pinch of salt, half a teaspoonful of sugar, juice of a quarter of \nan onion. Mix these ingredients and knead them as you would a lump of dough, then make them \nin the form of a cutlet and serve on a dish. \n \n"}
