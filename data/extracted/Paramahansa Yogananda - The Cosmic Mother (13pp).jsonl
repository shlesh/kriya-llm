And\nif Nature’s ways seem cruel and inexplicable at\ntimes (in India the Mother, in such moods, is known\nas Kali) why so do the mother’s methods of pro-\ntection and discipline seem to the young child.\n\nAs you sit in a dim and quiet forest, or stand\nagainst blue sky on a mountain top, or walk on white\nsand by the sparkling ocean, you cannot help but\nfeel a tenderness within you. That is your reaction\nto the Mother aspect of God. But if you close your\neyes and visualize vast space you will be enthralled\nby infinity, and you will sense the vibration of pure\nwisdom—naught else but wisdom. That is the\nFather aspect of God, the limitless sphere where\nthere is no creation, no stars nor planets, but only\nthe formless power of wisdom. That is the Father.\nTherefore, God is both a father and a mother.\n\nWhen God is spoken of as existing in three\naspects—the Father, Son and Holy Ghost—we see\nthe Holy Ghost as the Mother aspect, God as the\nFather aspect and all creation as the Son. As a mother\nis reflected in her son, so Nature is reflected in\ncreation. The Father and Mother aspects of God\nproduced a Son, an emblem or expression of their\nlove. We—parts of Creation—are components of\nthat emblem of love.\n\n—6—\n\nTHE TRINITY IN THE FAMILY\n\nIn a human family we see the miniature of that\ngreater family. God is represented in the father\nand in the mother, and in their expression of love\n—the child. Why is it that this trinity is found in\nthe family? Why is it? Because we are all parts of\nGod, and that is what God is. The Creator, who is\ninfinite wisdom and infinite feeling, desired vehicles\nthrough which He might express His wisdom and\nfeeling. So, manifesting in creation, His wisdom\nassumed the form of the father, and His feeling the\nform of the mother.\n\nEach one of us is only a partial expression of\nthe Infinite, because the father always moves by\nreason and the mother by feeling. Both are im-\nperfect. The father wants to govern the child by\nreason and force and the mother by feeling and\ntenderness. By beating a child that has been half-\ndrowned in wickedness in order to pull it out of\nthat desperate state, the stern father will only drive\nit further into evil. But the mother says, “Teach\nhim by love.” Sometimes a little bit of strictness is\ngood and sometimes a lot of love is good. But if\nyou give only sweetness, too much of it may spoil\nthe child. Both aspects of God—the father and the\nmother aspect—are necessary for balance.\n\n-7-\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - The Cosmic Mother (13pp).pdf", "page": 5, "text": "I have spoken of father love that is sometimes\ntoo stern. Not all mother love is perfect either. Fritz\nKreisler once told me, “My mother loved me so\ngreatly that she never wanted me to leave Europe,\nbut I wouldn’t be Kreisler today if I hadn’t outruled\nthe love of my mother.” Such love is selfish and\nbinding.\n\nGOD IN THE HUMAN FATHER\n\nJesus spoke of God as the Father. There are\nsome saints who speak of God as a Mother. After\nall, if you take God as transcendental He is neither\nFather nor Mother, but as soon as you think of\nHim in human terms He becomes the Father, the\nMother, the Friend, Child, or Beloved. So the\nfatherhood and motherhood of God are right in\nyour own family. When I think of my parents it\nis never as a father or a mother, but as the heavenly\nmanifestations of God.\n\nAlthough I have said that every man embodies\nthe wisdom aspect of God, you may sometimes find\nit difficult to see this. Perhaps you say, “Well maybe\nthe Heavenly Father is in this man, but he is so evil\nthat I can’t find any Divinity in him.” You must be\nable to separate the good from the bad. If you cover\na gold nugget with mud do you say there is no gold\nthere? No. You are wise enough to say that the gold\nis still underneath the mud.\n\n--8-\n\nReason and feeling, in their highest forms,\nboth have intuitive qualities. Thus pure reason,\nexemplified in man, can see as clearly as pure feel-\ning, embodied in woman. It is acknowledged that\nwomen have keen intuitions; only when they get\nexcited do they lose that power. But the highest form\nof reason is also intuitive. If the premise is wrong\nthe conclusion will be wrong. But intuition cannot\nbe wrong.\n\nThe divine man achieves a state of balance by\ndeveloping both the fatherly and motherly qualities\nin himself. As he concentrates on the heart he can\ndevelop the good qualities of the motherly aspect\nof God. And when he concentrates at the spiritual\neye, or wisdom center—above and between the eye-\nbrows—he will develop the wisdom qualities of\nGod. When I concentrate on the heart I feel all the\ntenderness of the Mother, and that divine joy is\ntight within my heart. And when I concentrate at\nthe wisdom center I feel all the wisdom of God the\nFather glowing there.\n\nSo the perfectly balanced man can feel toward\neveryone the same love that the mother feels for her\nchildren. That is what Jesus Christ felt. That is why\nHe said, “Father, forgive them for they know not\nwhat they do.” Why did He feel such love for those\nwho were crucifying him? Because he had developed\n\n—9—\n"}

To\nhim these were not enemies with spears who were\nnailing him on the cross, but they were his children.\nWho but a mother could feel as Jesus felt? They\nwere his children who didn’t understand him. When\na mother sees her son torturing her she is only afraid\nof what might happen to him. That is what Jesus\nfelt and thus he said, “Father forgive them for they\nknow not what they do.” I often think that if he had\nsaid “Mother, forgive them’, it would have been\nstill more tender an expression of his love.\n\nSo every human father—and every man, since\nall are potential fathers—should remember that his\nbody and mind must be a temple for the Heavenly\nFather, and there must be no evil passions to defile\nit, for these laws of sexual creation are intended\nonly for the propagation of the species. This body\ntemple must not be used to house evil passions and\ndesires, but its creative power directed toward the\nheavenly thought of producing vehicles for souls.\nThen, more important still, every father should\nremember that in him is templed the Divine Being.\nThe greatest creation of the human father is to\nproduce in his material children divine thoughts,\nand to foster his own spiritual thoughts, looking\nupon them as his divine children.\n\nAnd let every father remember, when tempted\nto speak to the child with harshness, “Because my\n\n—10—\n\nvoice is used by the Cosmic Father I cannot speak\nerror to my children, for my mind is a transparent\nglass through which the Father’s light is shining\nupon all my children—His children.\n\nAnd who # your child? Not only your physical\nchildren are your responsibility. They will all be\ntaken away from you some day. God has given you\nthis human relation so that you may give wise guid-\nance and protective care to every helpless woman\nand child you meet—just as every woman should\nradiate her pure motherly love to every man and\nchild she meets; giving that motherly love whenever\nit is necessary to protect and lift some person out of\nthe pit into which he has fallen. I see that mother\naspect in every woman. There is nothing equal to\nit—that pure unconditional sympathy of woman\ntoward man.\n\nIf a man will give that respect to every woman\nhe meets he will soon begin to see something in\nwoman which he has never seen before. But those\nwho look on woman as the object of lust encourage\nthat same evil within themselves. Woman was given\nthat motherly instinct to save man from the pitfalls\nof evil. That is the purpose of woman. She was not\ncreated for lust.\n\nI know of one great saint who exemplified this.\nA few of his disciples wanted to test him, and they\n\n--11-\n"}

He quickly jumped up and cried, “Mother\nDivine, in these forms you have come to me. I bow\nto you all.” Then the remorseful disciples made\nobeisance. And the sensual women bowed before\nhim, and were ashamed. His great love washed\naway that lust which had encrusted them, and they\nwere changed.\n\nMan should look upon woman as a mother. He\nmisses so much if he looks upon woman only as the\nobject of passion. A man may be a judge in the high-\nest court, but in his home, to his wife, he is a child.\nBecause that flood of Divine Love passes through\nthe mother, the human instrument, even the greatest\nmasters have shown honor to their mothers. Swami\nShankara, when his mother was dying, returned to\nher despite his vows (through which he had re-\nnounced all family ties in order to serve the greater\nfamily—mankind) and cremated her body in a\ndivinely produced flame.\n\nGOD IN THE HUMAN MOTHER\n\nIt is equally true that every woman must feel\nthat same love for all the world if she would radiate\nthe Divine Mother’s love. To inspire men by such\n\n—12—\n\na manifestation is to give the greatest blessing a\nwoman possesses.\n\nWhen woman is full of hate and anger she\nwill see in man those same qualities. That is why\nevery woman must guard against being conquered\nby her emotions, and keep herself free from wrong\nemotions. For every woman who is jealous and full\nof hatred will lose that intuitive quality which is\nher special gift from God. My mother had great\nintuition because she was free from jealousy and\nhate and anger.\n\nAll mothers are meant to be the unconditional\nmanifestation of God’s love. But human mothers are\nimperfect. The Cosmic Mother is perfect. And when\nI see the blindness of some human mothers then I\nsay, “This is not the encompassing love of the Divine\nMother.” When a mother can perfect her love so\nthat it is no longer possessive and limited, then it\nwill become transmuted into the love of Divine\nMother.\n\nAnd, as I said before, it is the duty of the mother\nnot only to love her own children but to give that\nmotherly love to all. “But,” you say, “we can’t meet\nall the people of the world to give them that love.”\nWell, there is an easier way to develop unconditional\nlove. When you meditate, concentrate on the heart\nand say, “I feel God as the Divine Mother.” And\n\n—13—\n"}

You\nmust be very proud that the Divine Mother took\nyour form to give tangible love to the world—not\nonly to your children but unto all Her children on\nthis earth. That last part of the statement you should\nstrive to remember—that the Divine Love which is\npassing through you is unconditional.

I found always, as I eagerly ac-\ncepted the love of father and mother, that I could\nsee their defects. Father would be unduly strict and\nmother would be unduly kind.

The\nfirst time I went to see him, I had to wait quietly,\nfor he said, “I am talking to Divine Mother.” He\nwas so great and yet so gentle and childlike! His\nwhole countenance shone with the love of the Di-\nvine Mother. When I was in his presence those\nvibrations were overwhelming.

I cherished it silently, within myself. One or\ntwo days afterward I went to the saint, and again\nI saw those upturned eyes wandering in the jungles\nof the Infinite. Such love you have never seen. In\nmost missionaries who go to India to “save the\nHeathens” I do not see that love of God. And I\nhave seen many Hindu priests and teachers who did\nnot reflect it.
