Through application of the moral\nand esoteric principles of original Christianity and of original Yoga presented\n\n~~ in these teachings -- especially the simple techniques of meditation handed\ndown to us by the Gurus of Self-Realization Fellowship -- you will discover a\nlife divine. You will realize a spiritual fellowship with other truth seekers\non this path; and the supreme joy of \"satsanga\" -- fellowship with God, our one\nFather.\n\nThe real meaning of any scripture can be known only through direct experi-\nence. That inner knowledge is accessible to all men who attain soul-perception\nor Self-realization. Followers of all creeds may apply Self-Realization Fellow-\nship teachings: basic spiritual truths that develop man's potentialities for\nliving a godly life. Our humble desire is to help you, through these teachings,\nto expand your consciousness until you understand by your own Self-realization\n\nag the eterpal.,-ruth behind all great religions, and to foster goodwill and uni-\nversal brotherhood in the name of the one God\n\nThe Self-Realization Fellowship principles and techniques will help you to\nerase forever all doubts as to the existence, nature, and power of God. But\nmerely reading the words of our Guru, Paramahansa Yogananda, will not suffice\nto bring forth the inner illumination of Self-realization. He often said:\n\"Mahavatar Babaji and Lahiri Mahasaya have given to the world, through this\nwork that they sent me here to establish, the scientific techniques by which\nreal truth seekers can consciously follow the quickest route to the Infinite.\nThe Lessons you will receive are impregnated with the spirit of the great\nmasters of Self-Realization Fellowship: Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna, Mahava-\ntar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, and Swami Sri Yukteswar. If you study the Lessons\nwith reverence and deep attention, and, along with that, deeply practice medi-\ntation, you will be in touch with the divine link of these masters. When a stu-\ndent tunes in with the wisdom of a God-sent guru-preceptor, then by his efforts\nto follow the guru's teaching, and by the inner guidance he receives from the\nguru, that student can find liberation. Those who are steadfast will ultimately\nbe lifted into the kingdom of Cosmic Consciousness.\"\n\nYou should give some time to God. No person is really so busy that he is\nunable to devote a part of each day to the most important of all man's duties --\nseeking oneness with his Creator. Students who knock at the door of spiritual\nopportunity with their best efforts will find it swinging open, for God does\nindeed \"help those who help themselves.''

He pointed out that attuning the limited human consciousness to God's\nwill is not otherworldly, but practical. \"Have a partnership with the Lord in\nall your undertakings,\" he advised. Without God's support man inevitably fails;\nbecause strength and wisdom for success in the battle of life come from the In-\nfinite Source. Ignoring God, man cuts his own lifeline. Those persons are clos-\nest to unraveling the mystery of life who are consciously seeking communion\nwith God, the First Cause.\n\nRegardless of religious affiliations, all persons who sincerely seek spir-\nitual advancement are welcome to study the Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons.\nThese sacred teachings constitute the formal religion of students who make Self-\nRealization Fellowship their Church. Initiation in the highest technique of med-\nitation, Kriya Yoga, is the spiritual baptism of this Church, and is given when\nstudents establish church-membership affiliation with Self-Realization Fellowship.\n\nApplication for Kriya Yoga may be made after completing Steps I and II of\nthe Lessons, a period of approximately one year if the Lessons are received with-\nout interruption on a biweekly basis, as is the case with the majority of stu-\ndents. Initiation in Kriya Yoga signifies acceptance of the holy guru-disciple\nrelationship between the student and Paramahansa Yogananda. Kriya Yogis pledge\ntheir spiritual loyalty to the Gurus and to Self-Realization Fellowship.\n\nYou are welcome to write us any questions about the Lessons or about spir-\nitual problems; or to request divine assistance through prayer. Your letters\nwill receive sympathetic attention and will be treated confidentially. Such\ncorrespondence is looked after by monks and sisters of the Self-Realization\nOrder. These renunciants have dedicated their lives to finding God by follow-\ning this path, and to serving Him by helping others (insofar as it is within\ntheir power to do so) toward that highest of all achievements.\n\nWe pray that to the end you travel with us the Kriya Yoga highway to the\nInfinite.\n\nSELF-REALIZATION FELLOWSHIP\n\n"}

God the Father\nis the Absolute, the Unmanifested, existing beyond vibratory creation. God\nthe Son is the Christ Consciousness (Brahma or Kutastha Chaitanya) existing\nwithin vibratory creation; this Christ Consciousness is the ''only begotten\"\nor sole reflection in creation of the Uncreated Infinite. The outer manifesta-\ntion of the omnipresent Christ Consciousness, its witness\" (Revelation 3:14),\nis Aum, the Word or Holy Ghost: invisible divine power, the only doer, the\nsole causative and activating force that upholds all creation through vibration.\nAum the blissful Comforter is heard in meditation and reveals to the devotee\nthe ultimate Truth, bringing ''all things to... remembrance. '\"! ।\n\nThe student receives in the 29th Lesson the Aum (Om) Technique of Med-\nitation, through whose practice he may hear the cosmic sound of Aum, the\nHoly Ghost. By deep attunement with Aum he comes to feel the presence of\nthe Christ. It is thus that we may \"receive him'\"'--i.e., consciously com-\nmune with the Christ Consciousness that was manifest in Jesus and in all other\nillumined masters. This experience of receiving the Christ Consciousness\nwithin one's own consciousness is the real ''second coming\" of Christ.\n\nDevoted, regular practice of the Aum (Om) Technique of Meditation (Les-\nson 29) and of the Hong-Sau Technique of Concentration (Lesson 21) is essen-\ntial in the daily life of every Self-Realizationist who is seriously seeking spi-\nritual advancement. He should also faithfully practice the Recharging Exer-\ncises (Lesson 8-A), whose principles were discovered in 1916 by Parama-\nhansa Yogananda.\n\nPLAN OF The Lessons are grouped into ''steps, '' each of which con-\nSRF LESSONS tains approximately twenty-five Lessons; at the end of each\n\nstep the student receives a summary of the preceding ma-\nterial, together with pertinent questions to help him in reviewing that step;\nand a brief questionnaire that may be completed and sent to Self-Realization\nFellowship as a progress report.\n\nMany different subjects are covered, in some cases at length (by contin-\nuation from Lesson to Lesson).

If you feel you are encountering some real problem or\nobstacle, do not hesitate to write to Mother Center for guidance and help.\nOtherwise, first give yourself time to study, apply, and assimilate the instruc-\ntions in the SRF Lessons. More and more of your questions will be answered\nwith each successive SRF Lesson.

{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 6, "text": "S-1 P-1 4\nPRAYER\n\nHeavenly Father, Divine Mother, Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna,\nBabaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswarji, Guru-Preceptor Parama-\nhansa Yogananda, saints of all religions, I bow to you all. May Thy\nlove shine forever on the sanctuary of my devotion, and may I be able\nto awaken Thy love in all hearts.\n\nsek\n\nTHE WAY TO A HIGHER LIFE\n\nSelf-Realization Fellowship teaches the highest principle of spiritual liv-\ning: meditation combined with activity. Everywhere people are working, but\nthey have forgotten God. First meditate and feel the divine Presence; then do\nyour work saturated with the consciousness of God. If you do this you will\nnever become tired. If you work for your Divine Beloved, your life will be\nfilled with love and strength. SRF students are taught how to dedicate inwardly\nto God all the day's activities; and, when work is done, to commune with Him\nin the temple of silence.\n\nSpirituality cannot be bought in a marketplace. God must be earnestly\nsought. When you are very desirous of finding Him, the Lord sends a guru. A\ntrue guru is a direct link with God. The guru has only one purpose: to intro-\nduce you to the Heavenly Father. When you are in tune with a true guru you\nare in tune with the Lord. The relationship is eternal. Even after death, a\nguru continues to help his disciples (i.e. , those who recognize him as their\nguru and who faithfully follow his teachings). This is a spiritual law.\n\nHence every SRF student should understand and respect the significance of\nthe link of SRF Gurus--Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna, Mahavatar Babaji,\nLahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar, and Paramahansa Yogananda--with whom all\nSRF students are connected by affiliation with Self-Realization Fellowship.\nThose who desire the help of these Gurus in finding God should follow the way\nthat the Gurus have shown. There are students who do not follow the teachings,\nyet expect spiritual benefits just the same. Those benefits will not come! An\nSRF student should never go to bed without first giving his deepest attention to\nGod. Those who practice the SRF techniques of meditation daily, with sincere\ndevotion to the Lord, will find by their own Self-realization the validity of SRF\nteachings. SRF asks no one to believe blindly, but to practice the methods\noffered in these sacred teachings. By being loyal to the Gurus in this way, the\nstudent makes it possible for the Gurus to guide him surely to the Divine Goal.\n\nSRF teaches control of the body until one is its master. Then when you\nsit to meditate you will not nod. Practice these teachings and you will make\nyour body a fit temple to receive God. The human body has to be made ready\nto receive the divine power. The state of consciousness has to be right. Then\nGod will come to you!\n\n"}

Only when He is convinced\nthat you seek Him not for the satisfaction of temporal desires or for spiritual\nglamour and glory--but simply to be His, unconditionally, forever--will He\nopen the door. The devotees who are faithful to the end are those for whom\nHe will open the door. But only He can tell when that day of final beatitude\n\nwill come.\n\nGod does not always appear before us just because we have meditated\ndeeply for several years, or for whatever we consider a proper length of\ntime. If there is some flaw in their love, even saints who have meditated for\nincarnations may be chastened by God's failure to appear. But to those who\nmake no demand, who just keep on striving, saying, \"Lord, I will wait for you,\nno matter how long it takes,'’ He will come. The greatest factor for success\nwith God is to have that resolute desire. Lord Krishna said, ''Out of one\nthousand, one seeks Me; and out of one thousand that seek Me, one knows Me\"\n\n(Bhagavad-Gita VII:3 ).\n\nGod is caressing you through the breeze, in the sunshine. He is the food\nthat you eat. He is the One that nurtures you as father, mother, and relatives.\nHe is the only eternal relative. That is why Jesus said, ''There is no man\nthat hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife,\nor children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, but he shall receive an\nhundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers,\nand children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal\nlife'' (Mark 10:29730).\n\nNo one belongs to another person. We have all come from God. On earth\nwe are seemingly strangers; it is only when we love the Lord that we become\ntruly brothers and sisters of all. Salvation is for men and women who love\nGod, those who go on seeking Him to the end--not just to ''stick it out, '' but\nbecause they love Him.\n\n\"Seek ye first the kingdom of God'' was Jesus' advice to all people. Man\nwas not made merely for producing children and for selfish aggrandizement.\nMillions of persons have thought those goals to be sufficient, but they were\nmistaken. At death they left this world, bewildered and dissatisfied, their\nsoul hunger unappeased.\n\nJesus, Krishna, and the Masters are great reflections of God, perfect\nexamples for you to follow. Thus you may know you too are a potential child\nof God. We are all sons of the one Father. But you have to realize that! May\nthat consciousness come to you! No one should call himself a sinner. What-\never your errors, they belong to the past; they are not you. God is yours!\nChrist, Krishna, and the great Masters are yours! Hold that truth in your\nbosom, in every thought you have; and one day you will find that you have only\ndreamed you were a man; you will wake and know you are a god, an eternal\nreflection of the Infinite Spirit. The greatest sin is ignorance of our oneness\nwith Him.\n\n"}

In order not to exercise volition, or will\npower, one would have to lie down and enter a state of suspended animation.\nEven the slightest movement of the muscles (as in winking the eyelids) or any\nact of thinking is initiated by the use of volition.\n\nA wish implies a helpless desire of the mind. A desire is a stronger wish;\nit is often followed by fitful efforts to manifest itself into action. An intention,\nor a determination, is a definite, strong desire expressed very forcefully once\nor twice through action for the accomplishment of a certain purpose.

But, in the first act of obstinacy, the baby is only using the\nnext phase of evolving will, \"blind will.\"\n\nBLIND WILL Will at this stage is termed ''blind'' because it is not usually\nguided by wisdom. Most young people use this explosive\nblind will without any worthwhile purpose, wasting energy and higher possibili-\nties on passions, temptations, brawls, fast driving, rash resolutions, ungov-\nerned appetites, and so forth.

This seeming thirst for knowledge\nis an indication, more often than not, that such persons are actually satisfied\nwith mere theories. Real seekers test and compare until they find applicable\ntruths that increase their realization.\n\n"}

But if\nMr. John continually puts off trying out that system of diet, he naturally\nloses interest in it as soon as the lecture seriesis over. But later on, when\nanother dietitian visits town, Mr. John is eager to listen to him, because he\nremembers the sense of enthusiasm and imaginary stimulation he felt while\nlistening to the previous lectures about a system of dietetics.\n\nThe chances are that once the second dietitian leaves town, Mr. John\nwill not try out his system of diet either. Or perhaps Mr. John tries it for\na little while, and then falls back into his old habit of eating ham sandwiches\nmade with white bread, instead of cheese or egg sandwiches made with whole-\nwheat bread, as might have been suggested by the dietitian. Mr. John, being\nimpelled by the theoretical desire to live right, thus develops the habit of\nlistening to all the new dietitians that come to town, without ever following\nany of their instructions.\n\nMr. John also develops the habit of going only to dietitians whose names\nand teachings are new to him--no matter what their value. He, of course,\nthinks he is smart and that he has \"outgrown!\" the best principles of dietetics\nprescribed by the first dietitian--even though such principles may have been\nbetter than the ones that have more recently aroused his enthusiasm. He\nimagines he knows a great deal about the various systems of dietetics just\nbecause he has listened to various disconnected lectures on the subject. So\nlong as listening to new principles of dietetics produces the desire and the\nnecessary action to work them out in daily life, so long is it good for a per-\nson to listen to such lecturers; but every \"Mr. John'' should remember he\ncannot follow all the systems of diet at the same time, and that he should not\ndiscard a good system for a lesser system of food science just because the\n१ 4 happens to be new to him.\n\nSEEK-- THEN CHOOSE THE BEST\n\nThe foregoing principles also apply to religion. Some students who have\nonly theoretically tried different teachings are still seeking, instead of apply-\ning in their lives the best teachings they have found. They believe that they\n\"know'' all the principles just because they have heard them once, or because\nthey put into practice a few of the principles for a little while.

(These are the \"seven stars\" and ''seven churches\"\nspoken of by St. John in the little-understood book of Revelation in the Bible.)\nEncased in the bodily prison, the soul consciousness and life force become\nidentified with the physical vehicle and its mortal limitations. Scientific med-\nitation awakens the soul consciousness in the seven cerebrospinal centers. In\na state of divine recollectedness, the soul intuitively realizes its immortal\n\n| । we nature and origin. -The various progressive states of soul awakening are\naccompanied by an ever increasing accession of inner peace and joy. In the\nmost exalted states, soul and Spirit become reunited in ecstatic, blissful\ncommunion, or samadhi.\n\nBy meditation, then, we connect the little joy of the soul with the vast joy\nof the Spirit. Meditation should not be confused with ordinary concentration.\nConcentration consists in freeing the attention from distractions and in focus-\ning it on any thought in which one may be interested. Meditation is that spe-\ncial form of concentration in which the attention has been liberated from rest-\nlessness and is focused on God. Meditation is concentration used to know God.\n\nPOSTURE One of the first requisites for meditation is correct posture.\n\nThe spine should be erect. When the devotee is seeking to direct\nhis mind and life force upward through the cerebrospinal axis to the centers\nof higher consciousness in the brain, he should avoid stricture or pinching of\nthe spinal nerves caused by improper posture.\n\nThose persons whose legs are supple may prefer to meditate sitting cross~\nlegged on a cushion on the floor, or ona firm bed. However, Paramahansa\nYogananda recommended for most Westerners the following meditation pose:\n\n© Sit on a straight armless chair with the feet resting flat on the floor.\nHold spine erect, abdomen in, chest out, shoulders back, chin parallel to the\n\n"}

The hands, with palms upturned, should rest on the legs at the\njuncture of the thighs and the abdominal region to prevent the body from bend-\ning forward. The meditation chair should be of comfortable height, other-\nwise there is a tendency to allow the torso to lean forward or backward. If\nthe correct posture has been assumed, the body will be stable yet relaxed,\n\nso that it is easily possible to remain completely still, without moving a mus-\ncle.\n\nEach of the foregoing details is a contributing factor toward the chief\naim of the meditation posture--an erect spine, held stable without strain or\ntension for the duration of the meditation period. If, because of bad habits\nof posture or congenital defects of posture, you experience difficulty or dis-\ncomfort in maintaining the specified positions of feet, hands, shoulders,\nchest, and abdomen, make whatever commonsense adjustments are necessary\nto your individual need; but strive always toward accomplishing the ideal pos-\nture recommended by Paramahansa Yogananda.\n\nWhen you are established in the meditation pose, inhale slowly and deep-\nly (through the nostrils) to a count of 20; hold the breath to a count of 20;\nexhale slowly (through the mouth )to a count of 20. Practice this six to\ntwelve times. (A shorter count may be used, provided it is the same count in\neach of the three parts.) Then inhale, tensing the whole body and clenching\nthe fists. Relax all the body parts at once and, as youdo so, expel the breath\nthrough the mouth in a double exhalation, \"huh, huh.\" Repeat this practice\nsix times. Then forget the breath. Let it flow in and out naturally, of its\nown accord, as in ordinary breathing.\n\nWith the eyelids half closed (or completely closed, if this is more com-\nfortable to you), look upward, focusing the gaze and the attention as though\nlooking out through a point between the eyebrows. (A person deep in concen-\ntration often \"knits\" his brows at this spot.) Do not cross the eyes or strain\nthem; the upward gaze comes naturally when one is relaxed and calmly con-\ncentrated. What is important is fixing the whole attention at the point between\nthe eyebrows. This is the Christ Consciousness center, the seat of the single\neye spoken of by Christ: \"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine\neye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light'' (Matthew 6:22). When the\npurpose of meditation is fulfilled, the devotee finds his consciousness auto-\nmatically concentrated at the spiritual eye, and he experiences, according to\nhis inner spiritual capacity, a state of joyous divine union with Spirit.\n\nMaking a steadfast effort, the beginner may in time perceive light, or\neven see the spiritual eye of three colors-~-a reflection of the actual luminous\neye in the medulla oblongata (at the base of the skull where it joins the neck).\nThis single eye of light reflected in the forehead is the astral eye of intuitive\nomnipresent perception. It takes deep concentration and calmness to behold\nthe spiritual eye; a golden halo surrounding a circle of blue, in the center of\nwhich palpitates a five-pointed white star.

The depth of calmness and concentration necessary for this are\nnaturally developed through steady practice of the scientific SRF techniques\nof concentration and meditation (Lessons 21 and 29).\n\nWhether you see the light of the spiritual eye or not, however, you should\ncontinue to concentrate at the Christ Consciousness center between the eye-\nbrows, praying deeply to God and His great saints. In the language of your\nheart invoke their presence and their blessings. A good practice is to take\nan affirmation or a prayer from the Lessons, or from Paramahansa Yoga-\nnandaji's ''Whispers from Eternity\" or \"Metaphysical Meditations, \" and\nspiritualize it with your own devotional yearning. Silently chant and pray to\nGod, keeping the attention at the point between the eyebrows, until you feel\nGod's response as calm, deep peace and inner joy.\n\nVISUALIZATION Divine consciousness is omnipresent. In order to attune\n\none's consciousness to it, it is necessary first to expand\nthe mind by meditation on some aspect of God's infinite nature. Visualization\nis not realization; but visualization is an effective aid in deepening one's con-\ncentration, which is essential for the deep meditation that yields realization.\nThe following exercise in visualization and mental expansion given by Parama-\nhansa Yogananda will be found helpful in preparing the mind to practice the\nscientific techniques of meditation that are given in later Lessons:\n\n\"Sit upright. Focus your gaze and your mind at the Christ Consciousness\ncenter between the eyebrows. Fill your heart with joy. Behold! the sphere\nof darkness that you see with closed eyes is becoming a sphere of light and\njoy. This sphere is enlarging. Now it is bigger than your body. Go on\nexpanding the sphere of joy and light. Your home and everyone in it are pres-\nent in the sphere of light that you are beholding. Go on expanding it until you\nsee your whole city in this sphere of light and joy.

One should realize, rather, ''God has become myself.\"\nThe soul is like a wave on the sea-bosom of Spirit. The soul wave is one\nwith the Sea, but the wave is not the Sea. )\n\nThrough daily practice of the foregoing instructions, you can prepare\nyourself for the practice of the basic techniques of concentration and medita-~\ntion that are given in later Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons. These\nscientific techniques will enable you to dive ever more deeply in the great\nocean of God's presence. We all exist at this very moment in that ocean of\nSpirit; but only by steadfast, devoted, scientific meditation may we conscious~\nly perceive that we are individualized soul waves on the vast ocean of God's\nbliss.\n\nThe meditation period should last at least thirty minutes in the morning\nand thirty minutes at night. The longer you sit, enjoying the state of medi-\ntative calm, the faster you will progress spiritually. Carry into your daily\nactivities the calmness you feel in meditation; that calmness will help you to\nbring harmony and happiness into every department of your life.\n\nUnending joy awaits the sincere truth seeker who conscientiously medi-\ntates each day. Through the grace of God, through the blessings of the Mas-\nters, and through your own devotional effort you can achieve the state of\ndivine joy experienced by all saints that have become established in the Lord\n(that have become consciously aware of their soul unity with Spirit).\n\nKEY POINTS\n\n1. Set aside a regular time and place for your daily practices of the\nspiritual techniques taught by Self-Realization Fellowship. Try to find a quiet\nplace where you can be free from outside distractions and thus be able to con-\ncentrate with more intensity. If possible, never use that place for any other\npurpose than meditation. Thus you will impregnate the spot with spiritual\nvibrations that will help you to make each day's meditation deeper than the\nmeditation of the preceding day. You may have there a small altar with the\npictures of Christ, Krishna, and the Gurus of Self-Realization Fellowship.\n\n2. Always begin and end your meditation with a prayer, suchas: ''Heaven-\nly Father, Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna, Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri\n\n"}

Early morning, upon arising, and the period just before retiring at\nnight are excellent times for meditation. Do not try to meditate just after\neating. Wait at least an hour if possible. The kind of food one eats also has\na definite bearing on one's health or ill health, not only of the body but of the\nmind. Be sure the diet includes an abundance of fresh vegetables and fruits.\nEat nuts, cheese, eggs, and vegetable proteins in preference to meat.

Drape the cloth over the back of the\nchair if a chair is used, and place one end of the cloth on the floor under your\nfeet. The cloth helps to insulate the body from subtle earth currents. Their\nmagnetic downward pull toward material perceptions is undesirable for the\nmeditating devotee. The yogis have found, also, that facing East (the direc-\ntion from which subtle spiritual solar currents are always flowing) is helpful\nin meditation.\n\n5. Bathing has a cleansing effect not only on the body but also on the\n\n“mind, and is therefore a beneficial practice before meditation. Bathing opens = `\n\nthe pores allowing toxins to escape; it also helps to distribute life energy\nevenly throughout the body, quieting the nerves and inducing calmness. One\nshould also take a \"mental bath\" before meditation: put aside all worries and\nproblems. Completely give to God the time you have set aside for meditation.\nConcentrate on one of His infinite aspects--Peace, Joy, Wisdom, Love, Light,\nBeauty--or on a personal aspect, such as that of the ever-loving, all-forgiving\nDivine Mother. Many devotees find inspiration by meditating on divine incar-\nnations of God such as Christ and the Masters. Reading a devotional passage\nfrom \"Whispers from Eternity\" or \"Metaphysical Meditations\" or singing a\ndevotional song from ''Cosmic Chants'' helps to uplift the mind. Meditation\n\nin itself is an unequaled \"spiritual bath''--a cleansing and rejuvenation of\nbody, mind, and soul.\n\n6. Practice of the Self-Realization Fellowship Energization Exercises--\nand also certain yoga asanas (body postures) - -15 beneficial in preparing the\nbody for deep meditation. The life forces in the body are harmonized by these\nrelaxing and calming methods, and one's attention is freed from aches and\npains and from the drowsiness or restlessness that keep the mind sense bound\nand body conscious.\n\nBe regular in your meditations (whether they be deep, or, in the begin-\nning, restless ). Be persistent if you would attract God's attention. Remem-\nber that meditation should be practiced with devotion, with real love for God.\n"}

Friendship is God's trumpet call, bidding the\nsoul destroy the partitions of ego consciousness that separate it from all other\nsouls and from Him. True friendship unites two souls so completely that they\nreflect the unity of Spirit and its divine qualities.\n\nTrue friendship is broad and inclusive. Selfish attachment to a single indi-\nvidual, excluding all others, inhibits the development of divine friendship.\nExtend the boundaries of the glowing kingdom of your love, gradually including\nyour family, your neighbors, your community, your country, all countries--\nall living sentient creatures. Be also a cosmic friend, imbued with kindness\nand affection for all God's creation, scattering love everywhere. Such is the\nexample set by all avatars and saints. Such was the example set by Christ,\nby Swami Shankara, and by Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, and Swami Sri Yukteswar.\n\nConsider no one a stranger.

How\nmay anyone dare to hate any other human being, of whatever race, when God\nlives and breathes in all? We are Americans or Hindus, or other nationalities,\nfor just a few years, but we are God's children forever. The soul cannot be\nconfined within man-made boundaries. Its nationality is Spirit; its country is\nOmnipresence.\n\nATTRACTING FRIENDS 1018 not necessary to know and love all human beings\n\nand other creatures personally and intimately. All\nyou need do is to be ready at all times to shed the light of friendly service over\nall living creatures whom you happen to meet.

The heart purified by friendship provides an open door to unity.\nTarough it you should invite other souls to enter the temple of brotherhood--\nthose who love you, and even those who love you not.\n\nFriendship should not be influenced by the relative positions of people. It\nmay and should exist between lovers, employer and employee, teacher and pu-\npil, parents and children, and others. God's effort to unite strife-torn humani-\nty manifests itself within each heart as the friendship instinct.\n\nSERVICE TO FRIENDS True friendship consists in being mutually useful in\n\noffering one's friend good cheer in distress, sym-\npathy in sorrow, advice in trouble, and material help in times of real need.\nFriendship consists in rejoicing in the good fortune of one's friends and in sym-\npathizing with them in adversity. One who has given his friendship to another\ngladly foregoes selfish pleasures or self-interest for the sake of his friend's\nhappiness, without consciousness of loss or sacrifice, and without counting the\ncost. Jealousy is self-love and death to friendship. Human love and friendship\nhave their basis in service on the physical, or mental, or business plane. They\nare conditional and may be short-lived. Blind friendship between selfish and\nunt hinking persons may end suddenly in blind hatred. Divine love has its founda-\ntion in service onthe spiritual and intuitional planes, and is unconditional and\neverlasting.\n\npacino ce ~------- ~~ mm a te ~ -- ~ --~ ~~ --- --~\n\nThe greater the mutual service, the deeper the friendship. Why does Jesus\nhave such a wide following? Because he, like other great masters, excelled in\nservice to humanity. Hence to attract friends, one must possess the qualities\nof a real friend.\n\nHelp your friend by being a mental, aesthetic, and spiritual inspiration to\nhim. Never be sarcastic to a friend. Do not flatter him unless it is to encour-\nage him. Do not agree with him when he is wrong. One who feels real friend-\nship cannot witness with indifference his friend's indulgence in harmful plea-\nsures. This does not mean one should pick a quarrel. Suggest mentally, gr if\nyour advice is asked, give it gently and lovingly. Unwise persons argue.\nFriends discuss their differences.\n\nLOVE YOUR ENEMIES The secret of Christ's strength lay in his love for all,\n\neven his enemies. Far better to conquer by love the\nheart of a person who hates you than to vanquish him by vindictive force. To the\nordinary man sucha doctrine seems absurd. His first impulse is to return two\nslaps for the one he has received--and to add a kick for good measure! Why\nshould you love your enemy? In order that you may bring the healing rays of\nyour love into his dark, hatred-stricken heart. When friendship is so released,\nit can behold itself as pure golden love. Thus will the flame of your love burn\naway the partitions of hatred and misery that separate your soul from other sauls,\nand that separate all unenlightened souls from the vast sea of Infinite Love.\n\n"}

Be generous to those who are generous only to themselves. If you heap\nhatred upon your enemy, neither he nor you will be able to perceive the inherent\nbeauty of your soul. Avoid doing anything that brings harm to yourself or to\nanother. If you are self-indulgent, or if you encourage a friend in his vices, you\nare an enemy disguised as a friend. Be true to yourself and to others, and you\nwill gain the friendship of God. Once you make your love felt in other people, it\nwill expand until it becomes the one Cosmic Love that flows through all hearts.\n\nThere are people who do not trust anyone, and who utterly doubt the possi-\nbility of ever having true friends. Some, in fact, actually boast that they get\nalong without friends. But those who fail to be friendly disregard the divine law\nof Self-expansion, by which alone the soul evolves and returns to Spirit.\n\nIf humility and apologies on your part will bring out the good qualities of a\nperson who considers himself your enemy, by all means apologize when neces-\nsary. The person who can:do this has attained a definite spiritual development,\nfor it takes character to be able to apologize graciously and sincerely. It is the\nconsciousness of his own inferiority that makes a man hide behind a display of\npride. Do not, however, encourage a wrongdoer by being too humble and apolo-\ngetic. You need not fawn on your enemy, just silently love him. Silently be of\nservice to him whenever he is in need, for love is real only when it is useful\nand expresses itself through action. Thus man may rend the veils of hatred\nand of narrow-mindedness that hide God from his sight.\n\nYou may ask: ''How can I learn to love my enemies? Iam not strong\nenough to do that. '' My answer is this: ''Constant communion with the Infinite\nby SRF methods of meditation fills one with divine love, which alone enables\none to love one's enemies. \"'\n\nAlways remember that you need the inspiration of better company--of those\nmore highly evolved than yourself--to keep constantly improving.

Try to resume\nsuch friendships, begun in a preceding incarnation, and perfect them into divine\nfriendship.\n\nOne may come in daily contact with some people and yet not feel in sym-\npathy with them. You have to adapt yourself to such persons and learn to love\nthem. But there are others with whom you feel instantaneously sympathetic at\nfirst meeting; it seems as though you have always known them. This indicates\nthat they are your friends of previous incarnations. Do not neglect them,\n\n"}

Always be on the lookout for\nfriends of past incarnations, by being calm within when you meet others; mental\nrestlessness and inattention may prevent your recognizing such friends. Not\ninfrequently such old friends are very near you, drawn into the orbit of your life\nby the friendship born in the dim, distant past. They constitute your shining\ncollection of soul-stars. Add to it constantly and seek in these bright galaxies\nto behold the one Great Friend smiling at you radiantly and clearly. It is God\nwho comes to you in the guise of a true and noble friend to serve, inspire, and\nguide you.\n\nEach human being has his own conception of what constitutes physical and\nmental beauty. What seems ugly to one may appear beautiful to another. Look-\ning at a crowd, you like some faces instantly; others do not attract you. The\nimmediate attraction of your mind to the inner and outer features of an individual\nis your first indication that you have found a friend of the past. Your dear ones\nwhom you loved before are drawn toward you by a prenatal sense of friendship.\n\nDo not be deceived by physical beauty. Ask yourself whether or not the ex-\npression of a face, the manner of walking, everything about a particular person\nappeals to you. Sometimes overeating and lack of exercise may sufficiently\nchange the features of a friend of former lives so that he escapes your recogni-\ntion. But an unattractive body may harbor the soul of a real friend. Sometimes\na beautiful woman falls in love with a homely man, or a handsome man with a\n\n_—physically plain woman, owing to the loving friendship of a past incarnation.  — .\nTherefore to be sure that your eyes have not deceived you with regard to physical\ncharacteristics of a person whom you surmise may be a former friend, ascertain\nwhether you are mentally and spiritually congenial. Guard yourself against being\nprejudiced by little peculiarities. Delve deeply into that person's mind in order\nto find out whether your tastes and inclinations essentially agree. Seek your\nfriends of past incarnations in order that you may continue your friendship with\nthem in this life, and perfect it into divine friendship it into divine friendship. One lifetime is not always\n\nsufficient to achieve the perfection of unconditional divine love between friends.\n\nUgliness of disposition and selfishness drive away all friends of former\nincarnations, whereas friendliness draws them toward you. Therefore be ready\nalways to meet them half-way. Never mind if one or two friends prove false and\ndeceive you, for others that are true will bring you many blessings.\n\nDIVINE FRIENDSHIP Friendship is the universal spiritual attraction that unites\n\nsouls in the bond of divine love. It may manifest itself\neither in two or in many persons. The Spirit was one. By the law of duality it\nbecame two--positive and negative. Then, by the law of infinity applied to the\nlaw of relativity, it became many. Now the One in the many is endeavoring to\nunite the many and make them One. This effort of Spirit to unify many souls into\nOne works through our emotions, intelligence, intuition, and finds its greatest\nexpression through friendship. When divine friendship reigns supreme in the\ntemple of your heart, your soul will merge with the vast Cosmic Soul, leaving far\nbehind the confining bonds that separated it from all of God's animate and inani-\nmate creation.\n"}

Then\nthe Divine Friend will rejoice to see you come Home after your evolutional wan-\nderings and roamings through the pathways of incarnations. Then He and you\nwill merge in the bliss of eternal friendship.\n\nOnly mutual effort to build wisdom and spiritual and intuitive understanding\ncan bind two souls by the laws of everlasting, universal divine love.

Finding\nthem, may I perfect our friendship, and find friendship with all; thus may\nI find Thee. \"'\n\nTHOUGHTS TO REMEMBER Making others happy, through kindness of speech\n\nand sincerity of right advice, is a sign of true\ngreatness. To hurt another soul by sarcastic words, looks, or suggestions, is\ndespicable. Sarcasm draws out the rebellious spirit and anger in the wrongdoer.\nLoving suggestions bring out repentance in him. Repentance consists in thor-\noughly understanding one's own error and in abandoning it.\n\nFriendship is pure by nature. When you have a lily in your hands, how can\nyou crush it? When you love a person dearly, how can you hurt him, even though\nhe may be wrong? Divine love is unlimited and infinite. When two or more per-\nsons are friends always, no matter what happens, that is an expression of divine\nlove, or divine friendship.\n\nAFFIRMATION\nToday I will forgive all those who ever offended me, and I will\n\ngive my love to all thirsty hearts--both to those who love me and to\nthose who do not love me.\n\n"}

In order to keep the activities of the\nbodily 26113 in motion certain external factors are necessary:\n\n« the ultraviolet rays in sunshine;\n\n„+ oxygen;\n\nnourishing food;\n\npure liquids, such as water and fruit juices.\n\n®m WH ++\n\nBut, more important, the body’s living cells are created and ener-\ngized internally by thoughts and by biological forces.

The vital sparks of\nintelligent energy that constitute life are but condensed thoughts of\nGod. Without these vital sparks of life, the external sources of bodily\nenergy are of no avail in maintaining life in the body.\n\nThe importance of depending more and more upon the limitless supply\nof energy available from the inner source of Cosmic Consciousness, and\nless upon other sources of bodily energy, now becomes clear. Healthful\nfood is necessary, but eating all the time will only make the body grow\nold more quickly. The only way to keep the body really rejuvenated is\nto unite human consciousness and Cosmic Consciousness through medita-\ntion.

Hold the breath twelve counts; then exhale,\ncounting one to twelve. Do this twenty-four times every time\nyou are out walking.\n\nOrdinarily, people concentrate only upon food, air, and sunshine to\nkeep the body well, but a time may come when health fails in spite of an\nabundant supply of these external sources of life. The realization then\ncomes that this body-battery must also be recharged by the inner source.\n\nBread (i.e., food) alone does not support life. If it did, one\ncould put food into the body of a dead man, lay him out in the sun, and\nexpect him to come to life. The Power that creates life, that enables\nthe body to convert food and air into energy -- That is the direct\nsource of life.\n\nThe life of an automobile battery depends not merely upon distilled\nwater indirectly supplied from outside, but upon the vibrating electric\ncurrent flowing into it through the mouth of the wires from the engine.\n\nSimilarly, man’s body~-battery does not live solely by means of\nindirect outer sources -- food, oxygen, liquids, sunshine -- but by the\ndirect inner source of the will, which causes vibrating life current\nfrom the invisible dynamo of Cosmic Energy to flow into the body through\nthe medulla oblongata, the \"mouth of God.\" (The medulla is located at\nthe base of the brain, where the back of the skull joins the neck.)\n\nIt is electricity that changes the distilled water into the force\nthat recharges an automobile battery. It is the life energy that con-\nverts oxygen, solids, and liquids into the force that keeps us alive.\nIt is the same life energy that made solids and liquids what they are;\nwhen we put them into our stomachs they must again be converted into\nenergy before they are of any use to the body. And when the energy that\nis in them is taken out, it is life energy that forces the residue of\nthis mass of waste material out of the body through the pores, intes-\ntines, and kidneys. Just as distilled water (the outer source of sus-\ntenance) alone will not sustain life in the automobile battery or bring\nlife back to the battery after it is dead, so oxygen, solids, liquids,\nand sunshine alone will not help a dead body-battery. The body must\nalso have life energy.\n\nGOD, THE ORIGINAL The medulla oblongata is the original point of\nSOURCE OF ENERGY intake of the life force as it comes from God.\n\nThe medulla oblongata is called the \"mouth of God\"\nbecause that is where God \"breathes\" life force into man.

Why? Because it is the center of all the centers\nof life in the brain and spine. It is the one center through which the\nlife force enters the body. The heart, brain, and cervical, dorsal,\nlumbar, sacral, and coccygeal centers of the spine are minor centers,\nacting merely as distributors of that life force they receive through\nthe medulla oblongata.\n\nHOW TO RECHARGE Science has proved that everything is being\nTHE BODY WITH ENERGY constantly recharged by cosmic energy. The\n\nhuman body is surrounded by a halo of conscious\ncosmic energy. The medulla oblongata is the antenna of the hodily re-\nceiving station that receives the radiographed cosmic energy from Cosmic\nConsciousness through the bodily radio operator -- will. Just as man\ncan use the invisible vibratory waves of radio to control far distant\nships on the sea, so God, through vibrations of His intelligent cosmic\nenergy, supplies our bodies with life force without any visible con-\nnection.\n\nGod created the original cosmic vibration or energy which, once\nstarted, became perpetual; and by wireless will power we can draw upon\nit and bring it into the body through the medulla oblongata. This\ncosmic energy, the same energy out of which we and everything else in\nthe universe were created, surrounds and permeates all creation, all the\ntime. It enters the body through the \"mouth of God\" (medulla oblongata)\nand is the invisible \"word\" that sustains all life.\n\nWe can learn to live more and more by that eternal supply of cosmic\nenergy which is always all about us, and thus ever available to us for\nrecharging the body with vitality. One may use the knowledge gained\nfrom these instructions to make the body fit in every way. A body that\nis free from disease and weakness presents less resistance to the med-\nitation methods and practices by which Self-realization is attained, and\nby which the human consciousness, as well as the body, is raised to the\nfatigueless state. .\n\nSelf-realization may be and sometimes is attained even by people\nwho are struggling with sick and otherwise imperfect bodies; but it\ncannot be attained unless one can concentrate and meditate uninter-\nruptedly upon God. Since it is difficult to concentrate and meditate\nwhile the aches and pains of the body continually have the attention of\nthe mind, the path to Self~-realization is made much easier if the. imper-\nfections of the body are eliminated and if the operation of its func-\ntions are so harmoniously arranged that the mind need not at any time\n\n"}

By practice of the scientific con-\ncentration and meditation techniques taught in the Self~-Realization\nFellowship Lessons, the sincere student can increase and refine the\nreceptivity of his consciousness so that he may ultimately perceive the\nChrist Consciousness universally present in every atom of creation.\n\nSt. John referred to this expansion of the human consciousness to\nreceive the divine when he declared of Christ:\n\n\"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to\nbecome the sons of God, even to them that believe on his\nname\" (St. John 1:12).\n\nThus, according to the Bible, all men may discover their actual\noneness with Christ Consciousness.

Underlying these expressions of life energy are\nwaves of sensation, and deeper still are waves of thought, feeling, and will force.\nHidden at the very bottom of all these waves of varied motions of life is the ego.\n\nEgo is soul in the delusive state of being\nidentified with the physical body. hy sical body.\n\nAlthough the body appears to be a solid mass of limited proportions, occupy-\ning but a small area of space, the cells that compose the body are manifestations\nof a vast ocean of molecular waves. The molecular waves of the body are mani-\nfestations of the still greater ocean of atomic waves. Atomic waves are mani-\nfestations of the immense ocean of electrons, protons and other atomic particles.\nThe waves of protons, electrons, etc., are manifestations of vaster oceans of\nvital force. The vital force (or life energy) is a manifestation of the measure-\nless powers of all forms of subconsciousness, superconsciousness, Christ Con-\nsciousness, and Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nAs a manifestation of chemical motion the body appears small, but since\nthese chemical motions of the bodily cells are actually condensed waves of Cos-\nmic Consciousness, the body is potentially vast and omnipresent.\n\nTissue is the general name for all the different cellular groupings of which\nbody organs are composed.

Self-Realization Fellowship instructions teach the\nscience of concentrating on the inner life energy and will power and thus awaken-\ning one's consciousness of his subtle spiritual nature. Strength comes from\nwithin; not from the muscles.

Such exercises do not cause a sufficient\nflow of life energy into the muscles and tissues to be more than temporarily bene-\nficial. By following the teachings of Self-Realization Fellowship. you can learn\nhow to vitalize every body cell.\n\nRelaxation means the release of the energy and consciousness that have been\nemployed either by the body as a whole or by some of its parts during mental or\nphysical activity. Man receives sensations coming from outside stimulation\nthrough his eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin surface by means of impulses\nthat travel through the sensory nerves. He responds to sensations by sending\nenergy out through the motor nerves, which causes tension or contraction of the\nmuscles.\n\nTension results when you will to send energy to any muscle. Lift your right\narm. What powers have you used in lifting the arm? ‘''Will power,\" you say.\nBut suppose your arm were paralyzed; your will to lift it would still be present,\nbut you would be unable to raise that arm. Why? Because the energy could not\nthen flow freely through the nerves into the muscles of the arm, transmuting the\ncommand of your will into action. If the arm were healed, you would again be\nable to lift it by will power.\n\nNow drop your right arm to your side again. Feel it throbbing with energy.\nBut can you lift it again without using will power? No! It is clear from this\nsimple experiment that both energy and will power are required in the movement\nof any part of the body.\n\nENERGY AND Raise your right arm in front of you, with the palm of the\n\nWILL POWER hand turned upward, until it is shoulder high and parallel to the\n\n(Experiment) ground.

Hold it there. Realize that a certain amount\nof will and energy is holding your arm in this position.

When you will to hold an increased weight you automatically\nincrease your will power, and the amount of energy sent to the arm, in order to\nhold the greater weight.\n\nTherefore we experience weight according to the degree of will power and\nthe amount of energy that we spend in lifting it. The experiment of lifting imagi-\nnary weights proves that an act of will produces actual energy in a body part, and,\nin so doing, produces tension (i.e. , contraction of the muscles) in that part.\n\nIf one touches the two poles of an electric battery, his hands will be ener-\ngized and tensed. If one drinks milk or eats food when tired, he will feel some\nenergy in his body.

By willing to energize the right arm, for example we:\n\n1) arouse energy felt as power,\n2) create tension in the muscles.\n\nThis shows that consciousness (will) is the prime factor in creating changes in\nthe flow of energy to muscles or to any body parts.

The scriptures are indeed divine wells whose wisdom-\nwaters man may draw to quench his threefold thirst for material, mental, and\nspiritual fulfillment.\n\nPhysical well-being is not necessarily a prerequisite for spiritual perfec-\ntion. It is desirable, however, because it is more difficult to makethe effort to\nachieve spiritual perfection when physical inharmonies are present. The aspir-\ning devotee who is not well physically may become discouraged, because it is\nnot easy to concentrate or to meditate uninterruptedly upon God when bodily\naches and pains are clamoring for attention.\n\nA body that is relaxed and calm conduces to mental peace, which is neces-\nsary for meditation, the spiritual art of communing with God. Therefore one of\nthe first steps in a balanced program of spiritual’: development is relaxation of\nthe mind and body--that is, the calming of the activities of the heart, lungs, cir-\nculatory system; and of the restless movements of the muscles stimulated by\nnerve impulses from the brain. By reducing the amount of energy expended in\nrestless (and often unproductive) muscular and mental activity, relaxation frees\nenergy to be used for the highest and most constructive purpose: concentration\non the Divine Indweller.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF Sometime when you are sitting or lying down and feel-\nRELAXATION, AND ing completely relaxed, with the breath expelled make\nTESTS OF PHYSICAL this test: Have someone lift your hands or feet a little\nRELAXATION way and then drop them. If your limbs fall with a thud,\n\nwithout even an involuntary effort on your part to lower\nthem gradually, you are relaxed. If any muscle is unconsciously willed to become\nenergized or tensed, you do not have perfect relaxation.\n\nRelaxation of the muscles and limbs helps to reduce motion--and hence to\nreduce the normal processes of cell decay in the physical body. When by tension\nthe bodily cells are kept active, that is, in motion, the cells deteriorate with\nwear and must be replaced. By perfect relaxation, cessation of motion in the\nbodily cells is achieved. When there is no activity there is no wear; the cells\n\n"}

By practice of meditation, the foregoing person who is all the time men-~\ntally restless succeeds in becoming \"once in a great while restful,\nalthough restless most of the time.'' This is the second stage.\n\n| । ` 3. “Further practice of concentration and meditation efhables the student to\ndevelop calmness to a point where he is “able to attain restfulness\neasily but is still easily made restless by events or environment. \"'\n\n4. By deeper practice of concentration and meditation and by higher lessons\nsuch as can be learned only from a true gurw-preceptor, the student\nreaches the fourth stage, in which he is ''restful most of the time, and\nrestless only once in a while.'' This is the opposite of the second stage.\nBy scientific meditation, it is possible to reverse one's nature from\nrestlessness to calmness.\n\n5. By the practice of the highest meditation methods given by a true guru-\n- or God-realized teacher,* the student at last becomes one\nwith God in samadhi, a state of pure bliss in which the devotee feels\nthat he, his act of meditation, and God--the Object of meditation-- have\nbecome One. This is the fifth and last stage of relaxation and Self-\nrealization, in which the devotee is ''restful all the time without ever\nbecoming restless.'' It is the reverse of the first stage, and can be\nattained only by being able to enter the state of samadhi at will, any\ntime, anywhere.\n\n*i.e., methods such as are taught in these Lessons by Paramahansa Yogananda.\n--Editors\n\n"}

Death signifies the complete destruction of the\nbody bulb, but not of the desire wires behind it.\n\n6. Conscious Sensory-Motor-Organic Relaxation Sensory-Motor-Organic Relaxation.\n\nConscious sensory-motor-organic relaxation consists in the switch-\ning off and on at will of the life current and the consciousness in\n\nthe limbs, muscles, inner organs, lungs, diaphragm, and especial-\nly in the heart and spine. This superior, conscious relaxation,\ngoverned by the brake of calmness, is to be taught soon in another\nSRF Lesson.\n\nThe six forms of relaxation just described can be illustrated by the various\nstages of light that may be produced in a bulb attached to a dimming apparatus--\nbright, less bright, dim, more dim, barely visible. The various stages of\nrelaxation represent the withdrawing, or dimming, of the consciousness and life\n\ncurrent from the bulb of the body. In full bodily activity, as in running, the body\n\nbulb is fully and brightly ablaze with life. In imperfect relaxation, it is semi-\nillumined with life. In perfect muscular relaxation the life light is less bright.\nIn sleep the life light is dim and calm. In meditation, the life light is a faint\nglow. In conscious trance, the life energy retires from the body bulb, but is\nready to be switched on again at will. In death the body bulb is broken, but in\nconscious sensory-motor relaxation one learns to switch off consciousness and\nlife current from the body bulb and to switch them on again at will. This power\ngives victory over death.\n\nRH\nTHOUGHTS TO REMEMBER\n\nThe body is sustained by will power and energy. If they were taken away\nyou would die. Will power brings energy from the outer cosmic source into the\ninner storage battery of the body--the medulla oblongata. By will that energy\n\nmay be directed to any part of the body. The greater the will, the greater the\n\nflow of energy into a body part. Energy is the \"missing link'' between the body\nand the mind.\n\nA nervous will is a mechanical will, drawing energy from the bodily store-\nhouse in the brain and dissipating it without conscious direction. SRF students\nare taught to visualize the body as divided into twenty parts (as each part has a\n\n"}

If you learn to utilize this energy that is constantly flow-\n\ning in you, you will never feel tired. SRF exercises help you to feel and con-\n\ntrol that energy in the body.\n\nToo often we write out checks of energy and do not replace energy funds.\nIf we write out checks and keep on putting money in the bank, our account will\nalways show a balance in our favor, and we will not miss what we spend. But\nif we keep on writing checks and do not deposit more funds in our bank account,\nit will soon be overdrawn. So it is with the body. If we write out checks of\nenergy and do not put back any more energy, we will become weak. But if we\nreplenish our bodies with energy, we will never feel tired. Nothing can heal but\nlife force. The whole purpose of true exercise is to awaken the inner source of\nenergy which we have ignored throughout our lives. How to awaken that inner\nsource? By sending life energy into the body by will power.\n\nगधन\nAFFIRMATION\nDaily I will try to realize that\nThou, O God, art the power that keeps\n\nme healthy, prosperous, and seeking\nspiritual truth.\n\n"}

But if\nthe internal bodily supply of life energy is exhausted,\nfood is of no use. A certain amount of energy is stored in the muscles, bones,\nmarrow, blood, and tissues of the body, as in a storage battery. The supply\nof energy in the body parts depends upon the oxygen and food chemicals taken\ninto the body, and upon the amount of energy drawn in through the medulla\noblongata. We want healthy muscles, blood, tissues, and so on, but good\nhealth does not result from the exercise and energization of muscles alone.\nThe cells in every body part must be energized. Therefore we should daily\napply scientific methods of recharging the body with energy from the inexhaust-\nible inner source. To teach a method of recharging all the bodily cells by\ntapping this inner source is the purpose of the present series of lessons on\nthe art of energization.\n\nTo refresh your mind regarding the principle of energization of the bodily\ncells, perform this little experiment: lift up your arm, then drop it. What\nlifted your arm? Will power and energy. You cannot lift your arm by will\npower alone. It requires both will and energy. The arm can be lifted only\nwhen will power causes sufficient energy to flow into that bodily part to lift\nits weight.\n\nLift your arm again. What is holding it up? Will power and energy. If\nyou do not use will power to keep it up, it will drop. Or, if the energy is\nsomehow cut off, the arm will drop to your side again. Will power and ener-\ngy are both necessary. Will power is the switch that controls the flow of\n\n"}

The greater the concentration of will, the greater the flow of ener-\ngy to a particular body part. The following exercise will further illustrate\nthe connection between will power and energy.\n\nMECHANICAL AND VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS OF MUSCLES COMPARED\nExample A\n\n1. Extend the right arm in front of you.\n\n2. Place the left hand upon the biceps muscle of the right arm.\n\n3. Bend the right arm at the elbow, observing the automatic contraction\nof the biceps through the mechanical movement. Note that the\naction of the will is in the bending of the arm and not in the contrac-\ntion of the muscle.\n\nExample B\n1. Relax the right arm, so that it hangs loosely at the side.\n2. With the left hand lightly grasp the biceps muscle of the right arm.\n3. Close the eyes.\n4. Then, without bending the right arm at the elbow, contract the biceps\n\nslowly to the maximum, using your will.\n5. Sense the tensing of the biceps muscle as a result of the exertion of\nyour will, but permit no mechanical movement of the arm. =\n6. Relax slowly.\n\nNote that this contraction of the biceps muscle (if done successfully)\nresults from direct action of the will on the muscle. (If you are not able to\ncontract this muscle of the upper arm, make the experiment with the forearm,\nwhose muscles some people find easier to tense at will. )\n\nSCIENTIFIC TENSION Tension results when energy is sent by will power\nAND RELAXATION to any muscle. There are varying degrees of\ntension, depending upon the amount of energy direct-\ned to the muscle. For the purpose of explaining Self-Realization Fellowship\nrecharging techniques, we shall refer broadly to three degrees of tension: low,\nmedium, and high.\n\nLOW indicates a small amount of energy;\nMEDIUM, more energy; and\nHIGH means as much energy as possible.\n\nThe withdrawal of energy from the muscles is called relaxation. This too may\nbe considered to have three states or degrees, from partial to complete relax-\n\nation.\n\nIn order to tense one must first be relaxed. However, a popular concep-\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 56, "text": "S-1 P-8 4\n\ntion of relaxation involves movement. A person who is asked to relax usual-\nly shifts his limbs about--in effect, tenses them--and then thinks he is physi-\ncally relaxed. But even as an automobile standing with the engine running\nburns energy, so also many persons, even though they may be sleeping, 81४\nting, or lying down, are actually partly tensed (low, medium, or high)\naccording to the degree of their mental nervousness; they are thus burning\nenergy even when their bodies are apparently at rest. When we move our\narm or any part of the body to relax it, and keep on moving it, we are not\nrelaxing (i.e., withdrawing energy from it), but are really tensing (1.6. ,\nsending energy to) it instead.\n\nEXERCISE IN Sit on a chair. Tense the whole body, then relax, taking\nGENERAL care to keep the body motionless. Bend forward with arms\nTENSION AND down and, clasping your hands together, hold an imaginary\nRELAXATION cord tied to an imaginary weight of 25 pounds. Will to lift\n\nthe 25 pounds, sending enough energy and will power to\nraise it one inch from the floor; tense the hands first and then add to their\nstrength that of the tensed forearms. Add the power of the tensed upper arms,\nthen that of the tensed chest, abdomen, buttocks, thighs, legs, and feet. The\n\"weight\" feels very heavy, but gradually tense harder and continue lifting it\nhigher--two inches, six inches, twelve inches. Now lower the imaginary\nweight to the floor, feeling the tension leave all the body parts. Sit back on\nyour chair, relaxed and motionless.\n\nThe best way to know the exact amount of energy required to lift an imag-\ninary weight of 25 pounds (or any amount) is actually to lift something that\nweighs that much. Relax after doing so; then try to employ the same amount\nof tension to lift an imaginary object of equal weight. Try increasing the\nweight to 30, then to 40 pounds; thus increasing the amount of tension, and\nhence the amount of energy in the body parts used in lifting.\n\nRELAXING Dogs and cats stretch and relax upon awakening, but man strips\nEXERCISE his muscle gears by jumping out of bed, suddenly throwing the\n\nbody into action in response to an alarm clock or telephone bell.\n\nAt whatever hour of the morning the consciousness first awakens in the body,\nremain lying on the back, with eyes closed, and practice the following exer-\ncise:\n\nTHINK OF THE BODY AS DIVIDED INTO THESE TWENTY MAJOR PARTS\n\nl.

He then developed this series of exercises for the\nall-round well-being of the body, instructing all Self-Realizationists to\npractice them faithfully every morning and night as a part of their regular\nspiritual routine.\n\nThe primary purpose of these exercises is to recharge the body battery\nwith cosmic energy. This exercises the body, strengthens the muscles, and\npurifies the bloodstream. These are not ordinary physical exercises. They\nare a spiritual technique -- a form of pranayama, or life-force control.\nThese exercises are important to your spiritual routine of meditation, for\nthey not only help to keep the body in a state of health and calmness that\nis conducive to meditation, but they also help you to attain conscious\ncontrol of the life force. When you have mastered the technique of con-\n\n| । scious life-force control, the restlessness and sense perceptions of the\nbody will cease to be obstacles to the attainment of the higher meditative\nstates.\n\nTo obtain maximum results, each exercise should be performed with\ndeepest attention and will power. Keep the eyes closed and focused upward\nat the Christ Consciousness center between the eyebrows. This center is the\npolar opposite of the medulla center at the base of the brain. The Christ\ncenter is the center of will in man. The medulla is the principal point of\nentry of cosmic energy into the body. Will is the power that operates the\nfloodgate of the medulla. By keeping the eyes focused at the Christ center,\nand visualizing the cosmic energy flowing into the body through the medulla,\na direct connection is maintained between the will and the flow of life\nenergy.\n\nVisualize the cosmic energy entering the body through the medulla\noblongata, and direct it, by the power of your will, to the body part that\nyou are exercising. Concentrate the energy on the central portion of that\nbody part.\n\nThe Energization Exercises should be practiced outside in the fresh\nair, or at least before an open window. Do these exercises slowly with deep\nconcentration! It is far more beneficial to practice each exercise cor-\nrectly a few times in this manner than to practice it many times quickly and\nabsentmindedly.\n\n@ It is also important that the exercises be practiced in the order\ngiven. Paramahansa Yogananda's instruction was unequivocal on these three\n\n"}

In increasing the number of practices, however, take care not to\nlapse into hurried performance. You may also practice any or all of the\nexercises more than twice a day, if desired, to help relieve fatigue or\nother bodily inharmonies.\n\nOnce you have memorized the routine, it should not take more than\nfifteen minutes to perform all thirty-eight exercises, allowing the sug-\ngested number of practices of each one. By this timing you will know if you\nare performing them too fast or too slow.\n\nIn tensing a body part, always remember to start with a low degree of\ntension, progressing to medium, and finally to high tension; relax from high\nto medium to low.\n\nNever tense with a quick or jerky motion erky motion.\nNever exert tension to the point of strain or discomfort strain or discomfort.\n\nIt is not necessary to hold \"high\" tension longer than three seconds at\na time. Use only low tension on any diseased or weak body part.\n\nAny instruction to \"inhale twice\" signifies inhalation, through the\nnostrils, of one short and one long breath. Instruction to “exhale twice\"\nsignifies exhalation, through the mouth, of one short and one long breath,\nthus: \"huh, huhhhhh.\" \"Huh\" is not a spoken word but an aspirate sound,\nlike a sigh but with more force. The expression \"double breathing\" means to\ninhale and exhale continuously in the manner just described.\n\nWhere no special instruction is given for breathing, one should breathe\ncalmly and naturally, without any attempt to synchronize the breathing with\nthe tension and relaxation.\n\nIt is recommended that, starting with Exercise 1 and proceeding in the\norder given, you learn and practice as many exercises as you can within\nfifteen to twenty minutes. Each day add one or a few new exercises to those\nalready learned (keeping the period of study and practice to fifteen or\ntwenty minutes) until all exercises have been learned and included in your\nmorning and evening routine.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: If for any reason you cannot perform the actual movements\n\nof an exercise, you should, nevertheless, with closed eyes,\nmentally practice the exercise.

Throat Recharging (repeat 3 times)\nWithout raising the chin, tense simultaneously all the muscles of the\nthroat: the front, the left and right sides; relax.\n\nTense simultaneously the left-front and the left-side muscles of the\nthroat; relax.\n\nTense simultaneously the right-front and the right-side muscles; relax.\n\nRepeat in this consecutive order until you have performed each phase of\n\nthe exercise three times. Conclude with an additional performance of phase\none. ~ ।\n\n9. Neck Recharging (repeat 3-5 times)\n\nLower the head so that the chin rests on the chest. Then, tensing neck\nand throat muscles, pull the chin upward against the tension until the head\nis tilted: back. Completely relax the tension so that the head falls forward\nof its own weight and the chin drops quickly back to the chest. The falling\nmotion of the head will culminate in a slight jerk as the neck reaches\nmaximum forward position.\n\n"}

Neck Adjustment (rotate 3-5 times each way)\n\nExert low tension in the muscles of the throat and neck. While main-\ntaining this tension, slowly rotate the head on the neck three to five times\nin one direction, then three to five times in the other. Relax the tension\nand rotate the head a couple of times in each direction.\n\n11. Spinal Adjustment (6-8 times)\n\nBend the elbows so forearms are almost parallel to the ground, keeping\nthe upper arms close to the body. With a quick jerk, twist the upper part\nof the body to the ‘left and the hips to the right. Then twist the upper\ntrunk to the right, hips to the left. (A twist in one direction counts as\none time.)\n\n12. Spinal Rotation (5 times in each direction)\n\nStand with the legs slightly tensed and the feet twelve to fourteen\ninches apart. Place the hands at the waist. Concentrate on tensing the\nmuscles of the back along the spine. Now bend the trunk slightly forward,\nmaintaining the tension along the spine, and rotate the torso above the\nwaist five times in one direction, five times in the other. Do not move\nhips; rotate spine from the waist up only; keep the spine above the waist\nstraight.\n\n13. Spinal Stretching (Side to Side) (3-5 times)\nIn the same position as the Spinal Rotation Exercise, with muscles along\n\nthe spine tensed, hands at waist, slowly sway the torso above the waist,\n\nfirst to one side then to the other side. Bend the spine as far as you can. _\n\nwithout moving the hips.\n\n14. Spinal Adjustment (Forward and Backward)\nStand with the feet slightly apart. With the fingers of the left hand\n\nplaced on the left side of the spine near the base or coccyx, and the\nfingers of the right hand similarly placed on the right side, incline the\ntrunk forward slightly. Now bend the trunk gently backward, simultaneously\npushing the lower spine forward with the fingers, arching the back and\nrising slightly off the heels. Repeat, moving the fingers a little higher\nup the back. Continue until you have gone as far up the spine as you can\nreach.\n\n15. Spinal Twisting (6-8 times)\n\nStand with feet apart, legs straight, and spine tensed. Raise the arms\nforward to shoulder level. Clench the fists; tense the arms; and slowly\nswing them first to the left and then to the right, pivoting at the waist,\nso that you twist the trunk above the waist only. The movement should be\nsmooth and rhythmical, not jerky. Palms of the fist face downward through-\nout this exercise.\n\nAs the left arm sweeps backward, the right arm should follow the arc,\nbending at the elbow so that the right fist touches the left shoulder when\nthe left arm reaches the end of its backward swing.

Concentrate deeply on\neach rap and feel that it is stimulating and awakening the brain cells.\nExcellent for improving the mental and nerve responses.\n\n17. Scalp Massaging\n\nHolding the fingertips firmly on the scalp so that the fingers do not\nslip on the hair, move the scalp with a rotary motion. Do this over the\nentire scalp. This exercise will loosen muscular tension in the scalp and\nstimulate blood circulation there.\n\n18. Medulla Oblongata Massaging (repeat 2-3 times)\n\nPlace the first three fingers of each hand on the medulla oblongata, at\nthe base of the skull. Pressing firmly against the medulla, move the fin-\n_gers ina small circle, three times in one direction, then three times in\nthe opposite direction. With the throat and head tensed as in the Neck\nRecharging Exercise, draw the head backward. Then relax and push the head\nforward with the fingers so that the chin drops quickly (but gently) to the\nchest.\n\n19. Biceps Recharging (each arm, alternately, 3 times)\nClasp the hands over the head -~ you may let them rest on top of the\nhead if you wish -- and alternately tense and relax the biceps in each arn.\n\n20. Four-Part Body Recharging (all four steps 1 or 2 times)\nRefer to Lesson 8 for Technique of Energization of the twenty body parts\nand variations in its practice.\n\n(1) Inhale deeply one short and one long breath, and simultaneously and\nslowly exert tension from low to high degree in all body parts. Vibrate\nwith energy for three seconds. Throw the breath out in one short and\none long exhalation and simultaneously and slowly relax. Feel the energy\ncoursing through the entire body.\n\n(2) Tense and relax each of the twenty body parts individually. Take about\nfour seconds to tense and relax each individual part, in the following\n\norder:\n\n1,2 -- left foot, right foot 11,12 -- left forearm, right forearm\n\n3,4 -- left calf, right calf 13,14 -- left upper arm, right upper arm\n5,6 -- left thigh, right thigh 15,16 -- left chest, right chest\n\n7,8 -- left buttock, right buttock 17,18 -- left side of neck, right\n\n9,10 - lower abdomen, upper side of neck\n\nabdomen and stomach 19,20 ~~ front of neck, back of neck\n\n(3) Tense consecutively each of the twenty body parts (from number 1. to 20),\nholding the tension in each one as you progress, until the whole body is\ntensed.

The body should\nbe tensed so that it literally vibrates with energy. Hold tension and\nbreath, and vibrate for three seconds. Proceed at once to step four.\n\n(4) Exhale the breath quickly, and simultaneously relax the four parts of\nthe neck and drop the chin to the chest. But continue to maintain\ntension throughout the rest of the body. Then relax the other body\nparts individually, in reverse sequence (from 16 to 1), until the whole\nbody is relaxed. Remember to relax one part at a time: Maintain the\ntension in each body part until its \"turn\" to be relaxed. If, while\nrelaxing the parts above the waist, you find that you have also unin-\ntentionally relaxed the parts below the waist, then simultaneously tense\nthese parts again, and then relax them one by one. The entire relaxa-~\ntion should be complete in ten seconds.

This is the best way to awaken your body in the\nmorning and set it in \"gear\" for the day's activity.)\n\n21. Arm Recharging (Up and Down) (3-5 times)\n\nKeeping elbows at sides, raise both forearms with tension as though\nlifting weights, until fists are at shoulder level. Relax momentarily;\ntense again; and let the imaginary weights down. Relax and repeat. The\nexercise is performed as though rhythmically lifting and lowering weights.\nPalms of fists should face each other.\n\n22. Double-Breathing Exercise (Elbows Touching) (3-5 times)\nWith arms outstretched sideways at shoulder level, and with elbows bent\n\nso that the forearms are perpendicular to the ground, bring arms forward\nwith a sweeping motion so that elbows, forearms, and fists meet.

Repeat alternately with the op-\nposite foot and arm. At all times during this exercise the spine and head\nshould be erect, perpendicular to the floor. When the arm is thrust for-\nward, the wrist and arm should be ina straight line, not bent; and the palm\nof the right fist should be turned toward the left, and the palm of the left\nfist toward the right. In other words, the fist should be turned neither up\nnor down.\n\n33. Arm Rotation (Large Circles) (3 times in each direction)\n\nWith arms hanging straight down at the sides, clench fists, tense arms,\nand rotate arms in a circular motion.

One may achieve this by practicing going\n\nto sleep at will. Relax the body and think of the drowsiness you usually feel\n\njust before you fall asleep. Then try actually to reproduce that state. Use\n\nimagination, not will, to do this. Most people do not relax even while they\n\nsleep. Their minds are restless; hence they dream. Therefore conscious men-\n\ntal relaxation is better than relaxation that is the byproduct of passive physical\n\nrelaxation, or sleep. In conscious mental relaxation one can either dream or\n\nkeep dreams off his mental moving picture screen, as he chooses.\n\nNo matter how busy we are, we should not forget now and then to free our\nminds completely from worries.and all duties. They should simply be dis-\nmissed from the mind. We were not made for them; they were made by us. We\nshould not allow them to torture us. When beset by overwhelming mental trials\nor worries one should try to fallasleep. If he can do that, he will find upon\nawakening that the mental tension has been relieved, and that the worry has\nloosened its grip. We need to remind ourselves at such times that even if we\ndied, the earth would continue to follow its orbit, and business would be car-\nried on as usual; so why worry? When we take ourselves too seriously, death\ncomes along to mock us and remind us of the brevity of material life and its\nduties.\n\nMental relaxation consists in the ability to free the attention at will from\nnagging worries over past and present difficulties; from constant consciousness\nof duty, dread of accidents, and other haunting fears; from greed, passion, evil\nor disturbing thoughts and attachments. Mastery in mental relaxation comes\nwith faithful practice in freeing the mind of all thoughts at will and then keeping\nthe attention fixed on the peace and contentment within. One can then divert the\nattention from worry to peace through meditation.\n\nHence, the devotee who aspires to develop uniformly and steadily in spiri-\ntuality should always calm the mind with the practice of concentration, keep the\nbreath quiet by proper breathing exercises, preserve the vital essence by self-\ncontrol, avoid temptation by mixing only with good company, and keep the body\nquiet and not in perpetual motion and restlessness.\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 73, "text": "8-1 P-9 3\n\nEveryone needs to let go of his worries and enter into absolute silence every\nmorning and night. At such times one should first try to remain for one minute\nat a time without thinking negatively, fixing the mind on the peace within,\nespecially if worried. Then try to remain for several minutes with a quiet\nmind. Following that, think of some happy incident; dwell on it and visualize\nit; mentally go through some pleasant experience over and over again until you\nhave forgotten your worries entirely.\n\nJust as there are degrees of physical relaxation, so there are degrees of\nmental and metaphysical relaxation. The term ''metaphysical'' is used here to\nindicate those states which go beyond the physical and mental realms.\n\nMetaphysical or super-relaxation consists in freeing the human conscious-\nness entirely from its identification with the physical body, money, possessions,\nname, fame, family, country, the world, and the human race and its habits.\nMetaphysical relaxation means disengaging your attention by degrees from con-\nsciousness, subconsciousness, the semisuperconscious state felt after medita-\ntion, and Christ Consciousness; and in identifying yourself completely with Cos-\nmic Consciousness.\n\nMetaphysical relaxation therefore consists in releasing consciousness from\nthe delusion of duality and truly resting the mind by keeping it identified with\none's own real nature: unity with Spirit. Man has hypnotized himself into think-\n` ing that he-is a human being, -whereas in reality he-is one with Ged.—~-- ~----+--—-~\n\nPHYSICAL RELAXATION When practicing the energization techniques one\n\nmay feel, perhaps for the first time, the differ-\nence between flesh and energy. With the tension of all body parts, energy is\nfurnished to every body part. In the subsequent relaxation, simultaneous with\nthe throwing out of the breath, relaxation is given to every body part.\n\nWhen, after tensing the whole body, one relaxes and exhales the breath, he\nshould cast away all restless thoughts, concentrating the attention on God-peace;\nhe should remain without negative thought as long as possible, and without inhal-\ning as long as no discomfort is experienced.\n\nWe should not jump out of bed suddenly upon awakening in the morning, but\nrather go through the routine of energizing the body while still in bed;\n\nClose the eyes. Tense the whole body slowly and then relax,\ngiving all the body parts a breakfast of energy. Tense and relax\ngradually; do not jerk. Then get up and repeat the routine twice\nin a standing position.\n\nAfter one has learned how to concentrate, he will be able to withdraw ener-\ngy from the body in this way and to consciously direct it toward the higher cen-\nters in the spine and brain where awareness of God's presence may be realized.\n"}

Whenever one is tired or worried, he should tense and relax the @\nwhole body; throw the breath out; remain without either breath or restless\n\nthought for a few moments; and he will soon become calm. However, when\n\nthere is only slight cont raction of the muscles, tension is not completely\n\nremoved upon the release of contraction. It is important to tense \"high\" and\n\nthen relax in order to have perfect relaxation.\n\nSCIENTIFIC TENSION AND RELAXATION\n\nIt is possible to distinguish three degrees of tension by trying the following\nexercise:\n\nRaise the right arm forward, parallel to the floor; gently grasp the\nright forearm just below the elbow with the fingers of the left hand.\nThen slightly tense and relax the right forearm by closing the right\nhand into a fist and then opening the fingers again. Now, hold the\nright forearm still, with drooping palm and fingers, and sense the\nfollowing degrees of tension:\n\n1. LOW TENSION. Partly close the fingers of the right hand; note\nthe low tension of the muscles in the forearm.\n\n९. MEDIUM TENSION. Close the fingers half way.\nThis creates medium tension.\n\n३. HIGH TENSION. Close the fingers tightly.\nThis creates high tension.\n\n(It is possible, but more difficult, to tense the forearm or the\nupper arm without closing the fingers. It is also possible to\ntense almost any muscle in the body individually, by application\nof Self-Realization Fellowship methods. )\n\nNow drop the right arm to the side. Tense it with will (as in point three\nabove), and keep the eyes closed. Open the fingers a little; then open\nthe fingers halfway; then open the hand and let the fingers relax; when\ncompletely relaxed let the hand droop.\n\nIn this experiment one can experience three degrees of relaxation, ending\nwith complete relaxation of those muscles. Feel the gradual withdrawal of\nenergy and the loosening of the muscles during relaxation.\n\nWhile one is relaxing the forearm or upper arm, he should be sure to let\nthe arm hang loosely by his side, and not lift it up. Should one tense and then\nrelax with the arm raised, he does not achieve perfect muscular relaxation, @\nbecause in lifting the arm he has had to tense, or contract, the muscles that\nraise the arm.\n"}

Strength is valuable, of course, but above all, calmness is neces-\nsary to enable us to learn concentration and meditation. Without concentration\nand meditation, Self-realization is impossible.\n\nPhysical and mental relaxation may be very successfully accomplished by\npracticing the above exercises while lying on a blanket on the floor, early in\nthe morning after the. bath.\n\nWhen performing such exercises, keep the mim on the medulla oblongata,\nand imagine the energy flowing into the body through the medulla and from\nthence to every part of the body.

The Heavenly Father meant to enter-\ntain and educate us, His immortal children, with a variety of earthly movies.\nWe must behold comedies, tragedies, and newsreels of life's movies with an\nentertained, joyous attitude, and learn from them without being overcome by\ntheir emotional impact.\n\nIn the dreamland we forget our names, bodies, nationalities, possessions,\nand our frailties. We unconsciously enjoy the great freedom that is native to the\nsoul. We must cultivate a similar but conscious awareness of soul freedom;\nwe must realize the truth that the soul is not permanently attached to its present\nbodily and world environment, sex, or race, but is omnipresent, eternal, free\nof any limitation.\n\nGod ''froze'' His thoughts into substance, and by maya or cosmic illusion\nHe causes us to perceive His dream of the cosmos, with its various sensations,\nas tangible and real. It is maya that keeps us from realizing that the universe\nis constructed of mind stuff and that it has no more reality than do our dreams,\nwhich we recognize, upon awakening from them, as creations of our own minds.\n\nGod has given the soul and mind the power to materialize thoughts in the\ndreamland; to create, in the same way that He does, a miniature cosmos. The\nphenomena of dreams show that we employ the instrument of the mind to repro-\nduce an exact and realistic copy of this world and of the experiences of mundane\nlife. God is showing us, in our dreams, that we, being His children, can cre-\nate substance out of thought, even as He does.\n\nIn the dreamland the soul becomes free to create a cosmos after its own\nfancy. It can move in a new body, in a new world; enjoy ice cream or hot tea;\nlive in the hot Sahara desert or in the bleak regions of Alaska, or in the heights\nof the Himalayas. In dreamland the soul can masquerade as a poor man ora | ।\nking; it can satisfy all its unfulfilled earthly desires by materializing them into\n"}

Here the soul can create, if it will, a perfect world, free\nfrom poverty, sickness, wickedness, and ignorance. Here it can be a part of any-\nthing it thinks it cannot be in its earthly life. Here the soul can perceive the birth\nof a baby or the death of aman. Here it cancry or smile, hear songs, smell\nflowers, touch, feel, think, reason, meditate, and perform every activity, even\n\nas it does in this earthly life.\n\nJust as we find this variety-filled dream life interesting, without believing\nin its actuality, so we must prove ourselves to be God's immortal children, who\ncan learn from and be entertained by the cosmic movies, without forgetting that\nthey are temporary and delusive. We must prove ourselves to be true sons of\nGod by appreciating the lessons of the cosmic movies without losing the unchange-\nable joyous poise of our inner beings--our souls--which are true reflections of\nimmortal, unchangeable God.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE All dreams have some significance even though all dreams\nOF DREAMS are nottrue. For even 'meaningless'' dreams are reflections\nof disordered, purposeless thinking. In fact, all dreams sig-\nnify the state of one's consciousness. The worldly man has worldly dreams. The\nactive man has dreams of activity. The evil man has dreams of evil. Imagina-\ntive people have fanciful dreams. Matter-of-fact people have dreams of daily\nactivities. The person who is filled with worry and fear has nightmares--which\nshould warn him to change his attitude lest he attract the objects of his worry or\n\n“fear; not omy through his conscious thoughts, but also through the powerfulvibras=\" |\n\ntions of his subconscious thoughts. The one whose thoughts dwell too much on\nsexual matters has dreams of sex, which signify that he must make conscious\neffort to dislodge these acquired conscious and subconscious sex impulses from\nthe conscious and subconscious minds. Subconscious optimism brings forth\ncomedy dreams. Subconscious pessimism turns out tragedy dream films. Do\nnot try to decipher the meaning of every dream--just remember that it probably\nsymbolizes your mental or physical state; hence you must adjust your waking\nthought and actions if you would clarify or improve your dreams.\n\nYou may ask: ''What about prophetic and warning dreams? Many people\nhave had true dreams and visions.'' This subject, as well as the meaning of some\ndream symbols that show one's state of spiritual development, will be dealt with\nat greater length in Step 2 of the SRF Lessons.\n\nDREAM ON THE LAP If you have faith in your relationship with the Infinite,\n\nOF IMMORTALITY through contact in deep meditation, you will know that\nwhether or not nature shatters your body, you are\n\nstill on the lap of that Infinite Assurance. Resurrect yourself from the conscious-\n\nness of useless human habits and changing human thoughts. Live every second\n\nin the consciousness that you are immortal; thoughts and habits change, only\n\nyour soul will live forever. This is not said to frighten you, but to quicken your\n\nunderstanding, to quicken your efforts, so that you will not keep the ever new\n\nbliss of your soul buried under temporary false satisfactions.\n\n"}

The body you see\nis nothing but materialized electricity. How can electricity be sick? It isa\ndelusion of this dream world, but simply saying that it is a delusion is not enough.\nIf, ina dream, you see a wall and you see your head strike the wall, you will\nhave a broken skull...in your dream. Self-Realization Fellowship teaches that\nit is only by coming in contact with God that one sees that the universe and the\nbody are nothing but condensed electricity, thoughts or vibrations of God \"frozen\"\ninto various forms. Science has said that electricity is nothing but energy. That\nenergy is frozen Cosmic Consciousness. We must not call it simply ''Mind\";\nthat term is too limited in its connotations. It is Cosmic Consciousness that\nmakes us sense different things; which enables us to have consciousness of matter\nas well as consciousness of Spirit.\n\nResurrect your soul from dreams of frailties. Resurrect your soul in eter-\nnal wisdom. What is the method? It includes many things: relaxation, self-\ncontrol, right diet, fortitude, an undaunted attitude of mind, regular meditation\nwith practice of scientific concentration and meditation principles. You may fail\nat first, but do not acknowledge defeat. To acknowledge defeat is greater defeat.\nYou have unlimited power; you must cultivate that great power.\n\nMeditation is the greatest way of resurrecting your soul from the bondage of\nthe body and from all your trials. Meditate at the feet of the Infinite. Learn to\nsaturate yourself with Him. Your trials may be heavy, may be great, but the\ngreatest enemy of yourself is yourself. You are immortal; your trials are mor-\ntal. They are changeable; you are unchangeable. You can unleash infinite powers\nand shatter your finite trials. Resurrect yourself from weakness, ignorance,\nconsciousness of disease, and above all, from the clutches of undesirable habits\nthat beset your life.\n\nNeither the dream of life nor the dream of death is lasting. Your last sleep\nin this body will be dreamless; nightmares and your beautiful dreams of earthly\nlife will bid farewell, at least for atime. Then, after a short rest on the downy\nbed of blissful oblivion, you will wake up in another dream of another life, in a‘\nnew earthly setting, or even on another planet. Then again you will be deluded\ninto thinking that you are awake when you are still dreaming. Alas, this delusive\nsleeping and waking in dreams will continue until man knows that he can really\nawaken only in God.\n\nAs in our dreaming we divide our minds into thoughts of many things, such as\nminds, mountains, souls, sky, and stars, and make every picture out of the tis-\nsue of fancy, so God has created in His dreaming mind a star-checkered savanna\nof the blue, a planetary family which includes the earth and its creatures, laugh-\ning, crying, living, dying.\n\nMay God make us fearless by letting us know that we are waking and dream-\ning in Him, and that we are His all-protected, ever happy Self. Let us unite our\nevanescent lives with His imperishable Life. Let us blend our flickering happi-\nness, which stales so quickly, into His enduring, ever new Bliss.\n\n"}

Perhaps you do not know that there\nis anything beyond the state of darkness. You can never believe unless you have\nexperienced it yourself.\n\nDo not be discouraged if a dream does not come for a long time, for it will\nfinally come if you persist. Sometimes you dream things that later you do not\nrecall. The reason one does not remember dreams is that the process of awaken-\ning withdraws the life energy from the subconscious mind, where the dream has\nbeen going on, and employs the life energy to vivify only the waking consciousness\nof the brain.\n\nMany students on the spiritual path, striving to go from the conscious to the\nsuperconscious state, become sidetracted in the subconscious. They get caught\nin the movieland of dreams, and become satisfied. As you take your attention\naway from the motion picture of sensory experiences, do not lose yourself in the\nmovieland of dreams. Pass by and race toward the Infinite Spirit.\n\nKK\n\nTHE MOUSE THAT BECAME A TIGER\n\nThe holy city of Benares in India is encompassed by a dark forest inhabited\nby wild animals. In the depths of this deep jungle was a beautiful hermitage in\nwhich lived a God-knowing saint. This holy man, who possessed great wisdom\nand many miraculous powers, had no one near to him in this world except a\nlittle pet mouse.\n\nMany pilgrims and disciples braved the dangers of ferocious tigers and other\nwild beasts of the forest in order to visit the great master, bringing with them\nofferings of fruits and flowers. (A disciple never goes empty-handed to his\nmaster, who, as God's agent, gives him priceless spiritual treasures.) Every-\none who came to visit the saint marvelled at the great friendship between him and\nthe mouse, and enjoyed throwing tidbits to his pet.\n\nOne day while a group of students was visiting the great master in his seclud-\ned hermitage, the mouse, chased by a cat, ran squeaking to the feet of the sage\nfor protection. Before the wondering gaze of his students, the saint changed\nthe little trembling mouse into a huge, ferocious cat! The metamorphosed\nmouse henceforth went fearlessly in the company of cats without being molested,\nand was quite happy in its new form except when one of the disciples ''who knew\nhim when\" would refer to him as the saint's \"glorified mouse-cat.\"'\n\nSometime later the same group of students was visiting the master again\nwhen the mouse-cat was pursued by wild jungle dogs. Meowing loudly, it came\n\n"}

The\nastonished students saw the mouse-cat change into a dog before their eyes. And\ngreat was the bewilderment of the wild dogs, who made a disappointed retire-\nment. The mouse-dog eventually became better acquainted and even friendly\nwith other wild dogs, playing and eating with them with a scornful sense of super-\niority to lesser creatures.\n\nOn another occasion, students who had seen the two preceding miracles\nwere studying with the master. In the midst of the lesson they were dismayed\nto see a full-grown Royal Bengal tiger chasing the mouse-dog, who was racing\nas usual for shelter at the feet of the sage. But the master, once again using\nhis miraculous powers, stopped the tiger in his tracks. Speaking to his pet, the\nsaint said: ''Mr. Mouse, it is foolish for me to go on constantly having to pro-\ntect you from your enemies. Henceforth, be thou a tiger. '' The students, once\nthey had recovered from their first fear, began to laugh and exclaim, ''Look at\nthe saint's fierce tiger! He is only a glorified mouse. ''\n\nAs time went by and visitors to the hermitage found out that the fearsome\ntiger patrolling the place was only a mouse uplifted to tigerhood through one of\nthe saint's miracles, they frequently made disparaging remarks about the mouse-\ntiger. Newcomers would be told by older disciples, ''Don't be nervous. That is\nnot really atiger. It is only a mouse glorified into a tiger by the Master.\"\n\nThe mouse that had become a tiger tired of this popular affront and he\nthought: 'If only I could kill the saint, then the cause of my discomfiture would\n\nbe removed.'' Thinking this, the mouse-tiger sprang to kill the sage. Instantly\nperceiving the motive of his ungrateful pet, the sage loudly commanded: ''Be\nthou a mouse again!\"' and lo, the roaring tiger became once more a squeaking\nmouse.\n\nDear friend, never forget that by using God-given power you may change\nyourself from a little human mouse, squeaking with failure and fear, intoa\nbrave tiger of material, mental, and spiritual success. But do not forget also\nthat if you become antagonistic to that power you may change again from a tiger\nof success to a miserable mouse of failure. Concentrate well on the duties you\nare performing, but always, in the background of your mind, hum a silent devo-\ntional song of love to your beloved Heavenly Father, remembering that all your\nabilities are gifts from Him.\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nMy dreams of perfection are bridges that carry me into the\nrealm of pure ideas.\n\n"}

Now I have for-\nsaken the jostling crowds of desires. In\nthe solitude of my mind, my devotion is\nbursting to hear Thy voice again.\n\n1.\n\nPLAIN LIVING AND GOD-THINKING\n\nDo you realize how you spend your life? Very few of us know how much\nwe can put into life if we use it properly, wisely, and economically. First,\nlet us economize our time--lifetimes ebb away before we wake up, and that\nis why we do not realize the value of the immortal time God has given us.\nToo much time is spent in rushing, in getting nowhere. Very few of us stop,\nthink, and try to find out what life can give us. Most people do not think at\nall--they just eat, sleep, and die.\n\nIt is important to differentiate between your needs and your wants. Your\nneeds are few, while your wants can be limitless. In order to find freedom\nand Bliss, minister only to your needs. Stop creating limitless wants and\npursuing the will-o'-the-wisp of false happiness. The more you depend upon\nconditions outside yourself for happiness, the less happiness you will experi-\nence,\n\nFostering desire for luxuries is a sure way to increase misery. Do not\nbe a slave of things or possessions. Boil down even your needs to a mini-\nmum. Spend your time in search of lasting happiness or Bliss. The unchange-\nable, immortal soul is hidden behind the screen of your consciousness, on\nwhich are painted at various times dark pictures of disease, failure, death,\nand so forth. Lift the veil of illusive change and be established in your\nimmortal nature. Enthrone your fickle consciousness on the changelessness\nand calmness within you, which is the throne of God; then let your soul man-\nifest Bliss night and day.\n\nHappiness can be secured by the exercise of self-control, by cultivating\nhabits of plain living and high thinking, and by spending less money, even\nthough earning more than enough to provide for extra things.

This is an infallible law of happiness. Is it not better\nto live simply and to grow really rich-~in Spirit?\n\nTRUE DESIRELESSNESS The soul's nature is Bliss, a lasting inner state\nof ever new, ever changing joy that eternally\nbestows Bliss that does not fade. One who has been made blissful by this joy\nof the soul, finds that the Bliss endures, even when he is passing through\ntrials of physical suffering or death. Desirelessness is not a negation of joy,\nbut the finding of fulfillment of all desires in the all-satisfying joy of God.\n\nYou must attain self-control in order to regain the eternal heritage of\nall-fulfillment lying within your soul. First, by meditation, give your soul\nthe opportunity to manifest Bliss, and then, constantly living in this state,\ndo your duty to your body and mind and the world. You need not give up your\nambitions and become negative; on the contrary, let the everlasting joy,\nwhich is your real nature, help you to realize all your noble ambitions.\nEnjoy noble experiences with the joy of God. Perform real duties with divine\n\njoy.\n\n७ You are immortal and are endowed with eternal joy. Never forget this\n\nशि तह your ptay with changeable mortal life. “This world is but a stage on\nwhich you play your parts under the direction of the Divine Stage Manager.\nPlay them well, whether they are tragic or comic, always remembering that\nyour real nature is eternal Bliss, and nothing else. The one thing that will\nnever leave you, once you transcend all unstable mental states, is the joy of\nyour soul.\n\nWHAT IS GOD? The usual conception of God is that He is superhuman,\n\ninfinite, omnipresent, and omniscient; but in this general\nconception there are many variations. Whatever conception we have of God,\nif it does not influence our daily conduct, if our everyday life does not find\nan inspiration from it, and if it is not found to be universally necessary, then\nthat conception is useless. If God is not conceived in such a way that we can-\nnot do without Him in the satisfaction of a want, in our dealings with people,\nwhen earning money, in reading a book, in passing an examination, in the\ndoing of the most trifling or the highest duties, then it is plain that we have\nnot felt any connection between God and life. God may be infinite, omnipres-\nent, omniscient, personal, and merciful, but these conceptions are not suf-\nficiently compelling to make us try to know God. We have no immediate and\npractical use for those conceptions in our busy lives.\n\nWe read about God in the various scriptures. We hear of His presence\n@ and listen to His praise in the sermons of religious men and saints. We\nimagine Him behind the veils of the beauty of nature. We think about His\n\n"}

But all of these windows, through @\nwhich we try to see God, are fitted with an opaque glass of uncertain inference\ndrawn from untested, unscrutinized data.\n\nWe cannot have full or direct knowledge of God through the limited pow~\ners of the intellect, which give only a partial and indirect view of things. To\nview a thing intellectually is to view it by being apart from it. Intuition is\nthe direct grasp of truth, seeing it by being one with it. It is by intuition\nthat God consciousness is realized. God is Bliss. He is ever existent. When\nwe wish for eternal Bliss, or God, we also wish for eternal, immortal,\nunchangeable, ever conscious existence.\n\nIt must be remembered that to seek God does not give us any excuse to\nneglect the various physical, mental, and spiritual battles of life. On the\nother hand, the climbing spiritual aspirant must learn to conquer moods,\nhabits, desires, and so on, in order to free the temple of life from the dark-\nness of ignorance and the weakness of disease, so that God's perfect presence\nmay be perceived. As a houseful of jewels cannot be seen in the dark, so the\npresence of God cannot be perceived while the darkness of ignorance, over-\npowering disease, or mental inharmony prevails.\n\nHOW TO KNOW GOD To know God is to love Him. Knowledge of God pre-\ncedes the ability to love Him. At least, we must have\nsome little conception of what He really is. We are told ''He is love, '' but we\nknow only human love; how then can we conceive that wondrous divine love\nthat makes all mankind free? Wood, stones, animals--all things are but\ndifferent manifestations of God with varying rates of vibration. Our own feel-\nings may be an expression of God, but they are not God. The wave may be\na manifestation of the ocean, but the wave cannot be called the ocean. Is\nelectricity God? No, for we cannot switch Him on or off. He is ever burn-\ning Cosmic Spirit.\n\nDo you really know the Supreme Being? Have you seen Him? Some\npeople say: ''He dwells in everything, '' others say: ''He is omnipresent.\"\nYet space alone is not God.\n\nWhen my Master asked me: ''What is God?' I said: '\"God is Spirit. ^\nWhen he asked: ''What is Spirit?\" Ianswered: \"Spirit is Infinite Intelligence.\nYes, ' he said, ''but Infinite Intelligence is God, so you see you are talking\nand reasoning in circles, and in that way you will never get anywhere.\"\nSubstituting different names for God does not define Him. Similarly, the\nBible says: ''The Word was God.\" But, what is the Word?\n\nIn the same way, when you are asked to define water, you may say: \"It\nis H2O, or aqua, or rain, or ९8, ! and try to define it that way. If you really\nknow what God is, then you can define Him satisfactorily to a new inquirer,\nbut when you try to analyze or define God without knowing Him, you only give\n\n"}

That was one of the questions I thought\nI was sure of until I found that I could not make a satisfactory explanation.\nBut from my Master's explanation I really learned about God, and found Him\nfor myself. God has been a reality to me ever since.\n\nFORCE AND There are two elemental factors in this universe: first,\nCONTRCLLING force, and second intelligence, controlling that force.\nINTELLIGENCE You cannot mention any one thing that does not have intel-\n\nligence. The human body is simply a combination of ele-\nments that can be found almost anywhere in nature's realm. Unless intelli-\ngence is init, it is only a combination of these elements, and nothing more.\nWith intelligence added, it becomes a live and thinking being. Can intelligence\ncome out of nothing? Is it not reasonable to suppose that somewhere there is\nsome sort of factory that produces that intelligence? We humans are only one\nof the many products of that factory of Cosmic Intelligence.\n\nGod is that invisible factory of intelligence that creates, gives birth to,\nand harmoniously develops all manifested things harmoniously develops all manifested things.\n\nWhy do the seasons come on time? Why do we have hunger in the body\nand food sources on this earth to satisfy that hunger? If there were no Cos-\nmic Intelligence, we might have hunger but no faod. Throughout the universe\n~ ~ 11 spite of the many mischievous pranks of nature--there always seems to\n\n| । 7८ a rhythm, and all things are products of the one factory of the One All-\nRuling Intelligence. But even when we say this, still we do not define that\nIntelligence. Here is the explanation:\n\nGod is that Supreme Intelligence which governs everything is that Supreme Intelligence which governs everything!\n\nSome people do not realize that there is a difference between force and\nintelligence. Electricity is a force, but unless we put it into a lamp, it can-\nnot give a light that can be used. Intelligence puts it into the lamp. All the\nforces of nature cannot satisfactorily work by themselves without the guidance\nof intelligence. The Cosmic Factory of Intelligence works in a coordinated\nway. Steam has power to make things move and fire converts water into\nsteam. These are only two of nature's forces, but they, of themselves, in\ntheir unharnessed natural state, do not accomplish anything importantly use-\nful; but when harnessed by intelligence, and directed rightly, they can be\nmade of great service to mankind. The earth and the whole universe seem-\ningly have been placed ona routine so that human life is made possible.

He\ntried everything, but his money could not buy a remedy for his chronic ail-\nment. At the age of seventy, when John lay dying from an attack of acute\nindigestion, he inwardly prayed: 'Lord God, if Iam to be born again, I\nshall be a happy man in my next life if Iam givena strong, healthy body free\n\n"}

I shall not care then whether I have riches or not.\"'\n\nAn angel of God appeared in a vision while John was dying, and whis-\npered: \"In thy next incarnation thy prayer shall be granted according to the\nsovereign command of the Most High.\"\n\nWhen John reincarnated, he was born in a very poor family. From\ninfancy his body was as strong as a Sandow's. The early death of his parents\nadded to the acuteness of his poverty. John's \"inheritance'' was a strong\nbody with a gnawing hunger; he did not have enough money to buy sufficient\nfood to appease its demands. However, according to the latent wishes of his\npast incarnation, John often thought to himself: \"Lord, Iam thankful to have\na diseaseless, strong body; it doesn't matter that I have so little money.\"\nYears passed, but no matter what he did, he was never able to provide ade-\nquate sustenance for his husky body.\n\nAt last, as John lay dying of starvation, he prayed: ''Lord, I have had\nenough of muscles! What use are they if Ihave no money to buy food to keep\nthem strong? Lord, if Imust be born again, please give me money and\nhealth and I shall be happy.\"\n\nThe angel of the Lord again granted John's wishes, and in his third\n\nincarnation he was born a wealthy, strong-bodied. man. As the years passed,\n\n“he often said to himself: \"I have everything; Iam happy.\" But later began to\n\nadd: ''Just the same, I feel that health and money are useless without some-\none to share them with. '' So as he lay dying of old age, brokenheartedly he\nprayed: \"Lord, if I must be born again, do not make life so miserably lone-\nly, but in addition to health and wealth give me a wife.\"'\n\nThe angel of the Lord, as usual, granted the wish of this devout, law-\nabiding man. In the fourth incarnation he was born rich, very healthy, and\nin due time came to marry a handsome but nagging, jealous wife. Our\nfriend passed his life virtually her prisoner. As he again lay dying, from\nage and nervous debility caused by the constant nagging of his jealous wife,\nJohn prayed: ''Lord, in the next life I want, in addition to prosperity and\nhealth, only a good wife. \"'\n\nThe angel of the Lord again granted John's wish; in the fifth incarnation\nhe was born healthy and wealthy, and finally came to wed a good, faithful,\nmeek wife, who agreed with him in everything. After two years, at the acme\nof matrimonial happiness, his beloved wife died. John was grief-stricken\nand passed his life like a monk, constantly worshiping the gloves, shoes,\nand other possessions of his lost good wife.\n\n(To be continued)\n"}

There are many forces at work seeking to\ndestroy this balance, to produce disease, fear, poverty, failure, and unhappi-\nness. These forces attack the individual to upset his physical, mental, and @\nspiritual balance. The great secret of mastering these forces was known for\nages by the great Hindu saints, and it enabled them to live far beyond the\nusual term of life in perfect youthfulness of body and mind, and in perfect\nspiritual harmony.\n\nThere are only two ways to travel in life: one leads to happiness and the\nother to sorrow. There is no mystery about life; it is very simple in spite\nof its apparent complexities. You should look at life unmasked, in the mir-\nror of your experiences. View time and space as they come to you in the\nform of problems, experiences, and relations. Look at the perpetual cur-\nrent of emotions and thoughts that arise within you. Go into the heart of your\naspirations, dreams, hopes, and despairs. Dive deep into the mute cravings\nof your inner self. Life is manifesting itself through all these channels and\ndemanding that you seek understanding with your highest intelligence, wis-\ndom, love, and vision.\n\nSorrow has no being of its own. It has no objective existence, but arises\nrather in the subjective nature of the sufferer. Constantly you affirm sorrow,\ntherefore it exists. Deny it in your mind and it will exist no longer. This\nassertion of the Self is what I call the hero in man. It is his divine or essen-\ntial nature. In order to acquire freedom from sorrow, man must assert his\nheroic self in all his daily activities. Sorrow is not necessary for the pro-\ngressive march of life, although the birth of joy seemingly comes out of pain.\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 95, "text": "5-1 P-12 3\n\nIn our relative existence it is evident that the conditions and circumstance\nsurrounding life are conducive either to sorrow or to happiness, as if in\n\ntheir very nature they were either desirable or undesirable. The root of\nsorrow lies in the dearth of heroism and courage in the character of the aver-\nage man. When the heroic element is lacking in the mental makeup of a per-\nson, his mind becomes susceptible to the threat of all passing sorrows.\nMental conquest brings happiness into life, but sorrow arises out of mental\ndefeat. As long as the conqueror in man is awake, no sorrow can cast its\nshadow over the threshold of his heart.\n\nRISE ABOVE Tears and sighs on the battlefield of life are the liquid\nCIRCUMSTANCES cowardice of weak minds. Those who give up the fight\nbecome prisoners within the walls of their own igno-\nrance. Life is worth nothing if it is not a continuous overcoming of problems.\nEach problem that waits for a solution at your hand is a religious duty imposed\nupon you by life itself. Any escape from problems, physical or mental, is an\nescape from life, as there can be no life that is not full of problems. Essen-\ntially, conditions are neither good nor bad; they are always neutral, seeming\nto be either depressing or encouraging because of the sad or bright attitude of\nthe mind of the individual concerned with them. When a person mentally sinks\nbelow the level of circumstances, he surrenders himself to the influence of\nbad times, ill luck, and sorrow. If he rises above circumstances by the hero-\nic courage that is in him, all conditions of life, however dark and threatening,\n~ will be like a blanket of mist that will disappear with the warm glance of the\nsun. The sorrows of the ordinary person do not arise out of the conditions of\nlife; they are not inherent in the conditions. They are born out of the weak-\nnesses and infirmities of the human mind and the effects of human experiences.\nAwaken the victor in yourself, arouse the sleeping hero in yourself, and lo!\nno sorrow will ever again overwhelm you.\n\nIgnorant people, like some animals, do not heed the lessons that accom-\npany pain and pleasure. Most people live a life checkered with sadness and\nsorrow. They do not avoid the actions that lead to suffering, and do not fol-\nlow the ways that lead to happiness. Then there are people who are over-\nsensitive to sorrow and happiness. Such persons are usually extremely\ncrushed by sorrow and overwhelmed by joy, thus losing their mental balance.\nThere are very few people who, even after burning their fingers in the fire of\nignorance, learn to avoid misery-making acts. People wish to be happy, and\nyet most of them never make the effort to adopt the course of action that leads\nto happiness. Lacking imagination, they keep rolling down the hill of life,\nonly mentally wishing to climb the peak of happiness, until something terri-\nble happens to arouse them from their nightmare of folly. Usually it is only\nthen, if their enthusiasm for happiness survives the crash to the bottom of\nunhappiness, that they wake up.\n\nDO NOT POISON Anger defeats the very purpose for which it is aroused.\nPEACE BY ANGER Anger is not an antidote for anger.

Knowing it is a disease, like the\ncoming of a cold, break it up by mental warm baths consisting of thinking of\nthose with whom you can never be angry, no matter how they behave. [If your\nemotion is too violent, take a cold shower, or put a piece of ice on the medulla\noblongata and the temples just above the ears, and on the forehead, especially\nbetween the eyebrows, and on the top of the head.\n\nAnger gives birth to jealousy, hatred, spite, revengefulness, destructive\ninstinct, wild ideas, brain paralysis, and temporary insanity--any of which\nmay lead to horrible crimes. It is poison to peace and calmness. It is\npoison to understanding.’ Anger is a manner of misunderstanding. To conquer\nothers by anger is the method of fools, for anger only rouses more wrath in\nthe enemy and thus makes him a stronger and more powerful opponent. A\nrighteous demonstration of anger to avert evil without causing harm is 80706 ~\ntimes productive of good. Blind, uncontrolled anger is revengeful, spiteful;\nit only increases the evil that you wish to destroy. Be indifferent to those who\nseem to enjoy making you angry.\n\nWhen anger comes, set your machinery of calmness in motion to manu-\nfacture the antidotes of peace, love, and forgiveness which banish anger.\nThink of love, and reflect that even as you do not want others to be angry with\nyou, neither do you wish others to feel your ugly anger. When you become\nChrist-like and look upon all humanity as little brothers hurting one another\n(\"for they know not what they do\"), you cannot feel angry with anyone. Igno-\nrance is the mother of all anger.\n\nDevelop metaphysical reason and destroy anger. Look upon the anger-\narousing agent as a child of God; think of him as a little five-year-old baby\nbrother who perhaps has unwittingly stabbed you. You should not feel a desire\nto stab this little brother in return. Mentally destroy anger by saying: \"I\nwill not poison my peace with anger; I will not disturb my habitual joy-giving\ncalmness with wrath. \"'\n\nOVERCOMING FEAR _ Secret fear creates tension and anxiety, and brings\nultimate collapse. We must have faith in our ability,\nand hope in the triumph of a righteous cause. If we do not possess these qual-\nities, we must create them in our own minds through concentration. This can\nbe accomplished by determined and long-continued practice. Fortunately, we\ncan start practicing any time and any place, concentrating upon developing\nthose good qualities in which we are defective. If we are lacking in will pow-\ner, let us concentrate upon that, and through conscious effort we shall be able\nto create strong will power in ourselves. If we want to relieve ourselves of\nfear, we should meditate upon courage, and in due time we shall be freed\nfrom the bondage of fear. Through concentration and meditation we make our-\nselves powerful. This new power enables us to focus our attention upon one\npoint at a time, and continual practice for an extended period will enable us\n\n"}

It will become second nature to us.

It rests with you\nwhether you want greed, sense slavery, anger, hatred, revengefulness,\nworries, or inharmonies to rule your life, or whether you will let the divine\nsoldiers of self-control, calmness, love, forgiveness, peace, and harmony\ngovern your mental kingdom. Drive away those rebel sense habits that have\nbrought misery to the empire of your peace. Be king over yourself, letting\nthe soldiers of goodness and good habits rule the kingdom of your mind.\nThen happiness will reign within you forever.\n\nYou must possess courage, faith, and hope. Courage is needed to fight\nagainst dreaded fear. We have said before that fear destroys life. There\nare many people who will not even attempt to work because they are desper-\nately afraid of not succeeding. They feel that they are not competent enough\nto do the work, and thus meet failure even before starting. The Bhagavad-\nGita describes how Arjuna, at first overwhelmed with fear of losing courage\n\non the battlefield, braces up and performs his sacred duty.\n\nAlways know that every day is a fresh opportunity on the part of the\nhuman ego to perform more and more exploits of heroism. Meet everybody\nand every circumstance on the battlefield of life with the courage of a hero\nand the smile 01-39 conqueror. Whatever comes your way and needs attention\nmust be considered as a duty. Duty is not imposed upon man by some superi-\nor power. It is the inherent urge of life toward progression; therefore, duty\nis action that needs care. Neglect of duty is a source of evil that can be\navoided by wisdom.\n\nALL IS IN GOD Avoid associating with those who are always complaining\n\nabout life. They may ruin your newly awakened spiritu-\nality, which is like a tender plant growing within you. Avoid such people\nand try to be always happy, no matter how you are situated. God will never\nreveal Himself to you unless you are contented and happy. You must satu-\nrate everything with the thought of God. Realize that all that exists is cen-\ntered in God.\n\nBe silent and calm every night for at least half an hour, preferably much\nlonger, before you retire, and again in the morning before starting the day's\nactivity. This will produce an undaunted, unbreakable inner habit of happi-\nness that will make you able to meet all the trying situations of the everyday\nbattle of life.

Whether one prospers is not dependent solely upon\none's creative ability, but also upon his past actions, and on his present ef-\nforts to activate the astral law of cause and effect. If mankind as a whole be-\nhaved unselfishly, the power of that law would distribute prosperity equally to\nall men, without exception. Those who by potent good thoughts and actions\nrouse this astral power to create positive prosperity succeed wherever they\ngo, whether they are in prosperous or poverty-stricken environments. There-\nfore, seek prosperity not solely for yourself and your family but for a wider\ngroup: your friends, your country, the whole world.\n\nEschew the desire for luxury. Learn to use less expensive things in an\nartistic way, with faith in the truth that you are a child of God and that as such\nyou have all the Father's riches, all the wealth of the earth behind you. When\nby meditation you release your consciousness from its preoccupation with hu-\nman limitations and realize yourself to be truly a son of God, you will know\nalso that whatever God has, you have.\n\nYOUR GOAL Most people live almost mechanically, unconscious of any\nIN LIFE ideal or plan of life.

You must determine\nthe goal of your life, and find the shortest road that can lead you there. Do\nnot travel unknown roads, picking up new troubles. Too much ambition of\nthe wrong kind is just as bad as too much passive contentment. As human\nbeings, we have been endowed with needs and we must meet their demands.\nAs man is a physical, mental, and spiritual being, he must look after his all-\nround welfare, avoiding overdevelopment of one side. To possess wonderful\nhealth and (-- appetite, with no money to maintain that health and to satisfy\nthat hunger is agonizing. To have plenty of money and chronic indigestion is\ndeplorable. To have robust health, and abundant wealth, and endless trouble\nwith oneself and others, is pitiable. To have health, wealth, and mental effi-\nciency, but lack peace and a knowledge of the ultimate truth is useless, dis-\nturbing, and dissatisfying.\n\nEFFICIENCY Assuming that the goal of material life is maximum ef-\nTHROUGH ficiency, peace, health, and success, what is the surest\nCONCENTRATION way to prosperity? Prosperity does not consist just in\n\nmaking money; it also consists in acquiring the mental\nefficiency by which one may uniformly acquire health, wealth, wisdom, and\npeace, at will. Great wealth does not necessarily bring health, peace or\nefficiency; but acquirement of efficiency and peace are bound to bring a proper-\nly balanced material success. Most people develop mental efficiency as a by-\nproduct of their efforts for material success; but very few people realize that\nalthough money is made to give happiness, happiness cannot be found if in\norder to acquire it one develops an insatiable, soul-corroding desire for\nmoney.\n\nMental efficiency depends upon development of concentration. One should\nknow the scientific method of concentration by which he may disengage his\nattention from objects of distraction and focus it upon one thing atatime. By\nthe power of concentration, man can use the untold power of mind to accom-\nplish that which he desires, and he can guard all doors through which failure\nmay enter. All men of success have been men of great concentration, men\nwho could dive deeply into their problems and come up with the pearls of right\nsolutions. Most people are suffocated by distraction and are unable to fish out\n\nthe pearls of success.\n\nIn concentrating upon his little physical needs man often forgets his great-\ner need of developing mental efficiency in everything, and of acquiring divine\ncontentment. Man is so busy multiplying the conditions of his physical comfort\n\n"}

Passive people\nwant God to do all the work; egotists ascribe all their success to themselves.\nPassive people do not use the power of God residing in their intelligence.\nEgotists, although they may use their God-given intelligence, fail to ask, and\nreceive, God's direction as to where and how the intelligence should be used.\nI can blame inertia as the cause of failure in the first instance; but it hurts\nme to see intelligent egotists fail after making a real and well-thought-out\neffort.\n\nHowever, even a man of concentration and power may dive deep into the\nsea of problems and still not find the pearl of success. There are many per-\nsons of powerful concentration, who do not know where to strike success; and\nmany brilliant people with efficient minds have starved, or have had only mea-\nger success. This is where another factor in acquiring prosperity comes in~\nto consideration.\n\nAll prosperity is measured out to man according to the law of cause and\neffect, which governs not only this life but all past lives. That is why intelli-\ngent people may be born poor or unhealthy, and a mentally mediocre person\nmay be born healthy and wealthy. All men were originally sons of God made ©}\nin His image having free choice and equal power of accomplishment. But by\nmisuse of his God-given reason and will power, man has fallen under the con-\ntrol of the natural law of cause and effect of action (karma) and has thereby\nlimited his freedom to make a success of life. A man's success depends not\nonly upon his intelligence and efficiency but upon the nature of his past actions.\nHowever, there is a way to overcome the unfavorable results of past actions.\n\nThe causes of failure must be destroyed and a new cause for success set in\nmotion.\n\nGOD'S WILL Mentally broadcast this truth: ''My Father and Iare One\"\nAND YOUR WILL --until you feel His overpowering, all-solacing bliss.\n3 * this happens, you have made the contact. Then af-\nfirm your celestial right by praying: ''Father, Iam Thy child.

The conscious mind still has to achieve\nthe success, and may be hindered by the unfavorable working of the law of\ncause and effect. The conscious mind alone cannot initiate a new cause that\nwill bring positive success in any direction; but when the human mind attunes\nitself to God, inthe state of superconsciousness, it can be sure of success;\nfor the superconscious mind is in tune with the unlimited power of God, andis\ntherefore able to create a new cause of success.\n\nTHE SECRET WAY TO PROSPERITY\n\nThe surest way to prosperity lies in establishing first your oneness with\nGod and afterward claiming a divine son's share. You must make the blissful\nunion with God first by regular, ever deepening meditation each day, accord-\ning to the Self-Realization Fellowship techniques. When you achieve that at-\ntunement, your status will be changed from that of a mortal beggar to that of\na divine son and you will automatically gain what you need. The omnipresent\nFather knows all the needs of a true son.\n\nIf in this way the poor win victories in the struggle to satisfy the demands\nof real necessities, they receive contentment and may live and die rich. That\nis real prosperity. But to live without contentment and die spiritually poor in\nspite of material riches is real poverty. Maintain a prosperous attitude by\nsmiling, no matter what happens. Do not be afraid to sell the bonds of smiles\n\n“when the market of happiness is low. Keep smiling while planning and acting ` `\n\nfor success, and your smiles will fetch priceless treasure inthe end. Wise,\npersevering activity with unfading smiles brings sure success.\n\nPRAYER FOR DIVINE GUIDANCE AND PROSPERITY\n\nMany persons have dived into the ocean of Thine abundance again and\nagain to seek the pearls of opulence, power, and wisdom; but only a few divers\nhave found them. These few persons have praised the wondrous riches of Thy\nsea because they dived well and found the secret treasure nook. Those who\ndived in the wrong places blamed Thy blue brine of abundance for being devoid\nof the most desired treasures. Many persons perish diving in Thy treasure\nsea, being devoured by monsters of selfishness, greed, faithlessness, doubt,\nidleness, and skepticism.\n\nHeavenly Father, I will not say that Thine ocean of everything is empty,\nfor Thou wilt show me that the fault is with my diving. I will put on the diving\napparel of faith, power, and fortitude, and Thou wilt direct my mind to dive\nin the right place, where Thy bounty is hidden.\n\nSEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD\n\nReal success does not perish with this earthly life.

Compare the\nlives of saints and others who have lived with God, to the lives of nonspiritu-\nal people. The saints have everything because they have God.\n\nDo not cry because of lowly position while you are on earth, nor beg for\nan improvement in it.

Don't desire things just because your friends have them.\n\nIf it is money or health you are seeking, depending upon God is the surest way\nto obtain them. When you deserve them, you will get them.\n\nSuccess must always come from God. The world can give you just so\nmuch and no more. But God can give you health, prosperity, and wisdom\nwithout limit.

Seek the way that can never fail.\n\nGod may take away something from you so that you will cease being im-\nmersed in matter and seek Him; then when you seek Him, you will find that\nwhich you lost.

Egotism\nreveals its smallness by ineffectually trying to make others feel small. Hum-\nbleness is the manifestation of an understanding heart, and sets an example\nof greatness for others to follow. Egotism is the brittle imitation armor of\ndeluded souls, while humbleness is the inner costume of saints. Egotism\nrepels friends and truth; humbleness attracts friends and understanding. The\negotist, like an empty vessel, makes much noise, whereas the humble man\nis like a cask filled with the precious wine of wisdom.\n\nMan in his egotism reveals a limitation of knowledge; whereas God, who\nis all wisdom, is humble and never egotistical, because He knows everything. @\n\n"}

The humble\nperson knows that there can be no one greater than God, and therefore he\ndraws God to himself through the fragrance of his humility.\n\nThe egotistical man has plenty of time to speak to others of his impor-\ntance because he is not busy performing outstanding deeds, but the really\ngreat man is humble because he is so busy doing remarkable things that he\nhas no time to speak of his greatness. The egotistical man watches some of\nhis qualities so gloatingly that he forgets to acquire more good qualities; in\nfact he manages to be satisfied with his small attainments by making them\nlook big to himself.

As the baby\n\n` grew-within-the-womb,-he taught the unborn child the secrets of the scriptures\n\nthrough the subconscious mind of the mother. This baby, when born, was\nnamed Shuka Deva. Because of his prenatal training he proved to be a most\nunusual child. At the age of seven he was already versed in the difficult\nHindu scriptures and was ready to renounce the world and seek a true master.\n\nIn India it is customary for a devotee to seek out spiritual teachers until\nhe finds the one whom he recognizes as his own God-chosen master or guru.\nThe novice, through inner fitful urgings, receives lessons from various\nsources; but when his spiritual ardor becomes very great, God sends him a\nguru. God uses the divine soul-vehicle of the guru as His messenger or\ninstrument to bring the novice back to his spiritual home in Omnipresence.\n\nWhen Shuka Deva decided to go in search of his guru, his father advised\nhim to go to King Janaka, the ruler of the province. As Shuka Deva entered\nthe royal palace he saw the king sitting on an emerald- and diamond - studded\ngolden throne surrounded by courtiers and by scantily clad women who were\nfanning him with big palm leaves (as is the custom in India during the hot\nseason). King Janaka was smoking a big oriental pipe. This sight shocked\nShuka Deva; he turned back and started walking briskly out of the palace. He\nmuttered: 'Shame on my father for sending me to that matter-soaked king!\nHow could such a worldly man be my teacher?\"\n\nBut King Janaka was both a king and a saint.

A good many people let their whole life go by,\n\nmaking repeated good resolutions to improve, without ever\nsucceeding in establishing and following new patterns of action that are whole-\nsome. More often than not we find ourselves doing, not what we wish to do,\nbut what we are accustomed to doing. That is why materially minded people\nfind it difficult to be spiritually minded even when they try hard. Spiritual\npeople find it similarly difficult to be material even when associating with\nworldly persons. It is difficult for vicious people to be good and kind; it is\njust as unthinkable for noble persons to behave meanly.\n\nHabits are automatic mental machines installed by man to exercise econ-\nomy in the initial use of willpower and effort required to perform specific\nactions. Habits make the performance of such actions easier. Friendly good\nhabits are very helpful in making the performance of difficult good deeds eas-\nier. Evil habits,howéver sympathetic, are deadly, inasmuch as they are die-\nhards and keep on disturbing the senses even when strongly commanded to\ncease doing so. Bad habits and sin are temporary misery-making grafts on\nthe soul. They must be thrown out sometime, as they are not a part of man's\nfree nature and therefore cannot be tolerated indefinitely by his soul.\n\nVery seldom do we realize that the health, success, and wisdom outlook\nof our life entirely depends upon the issue of the battle between our good and\nbad habits. Henceforth we should not allow our bodily kingdom to be occupied\nby bad habits. We should put bad habits to flight by training all our diverse\ngood habits in the art of victorious psychological warfare.\n\nThe soldiers of bad habits and of ill health and negation are invigorated\nby specific bad actions; whereas the soldiers of good habits become stimulat -\ned by specific good actions.

Feed good habits with good actions.\n\nINFLUENCE OF The habits that were formed earliest in your life have\nEARLY HABITS kept you quite busy until now; unwelcome habits have per-\n\nhaps crowded out many worthwhile activities. The\nsocial world moves on the wheels of certain habits. Few people notice wheth-\ner it is headed for the mire of petty engagements that choke the progressive\nactivities of life, or if it perchance is rolling recklessly toward the chasm of\nspiritual ignorance.\n\nPeople should be taught from childhood to develop discrimination by med-\nitative contact with the superior pleasures of peace, harmony, and joy, and\nshould form spiritual habits early. Since we are ruled by habits--which form\nour tendencies, moods, and desires--if bad habits are in the lead our moods\nand actions become evil. So, the precedence of good habits is desirable, as\nthey can guide our actions and moods to a happy goal.\n\nWrong habits may promise a little temporary happiness, but ultimately\nthey bring misery and destroy happiness. People who yield to the temptation\nof harmful habits do not fully realize this. Eventually they become so used\nto these habits that they helplessly drift on, becoming more and more inured\nto the subtle tortures of continuing their wrong habits. Finally they reacha\n\n_State where the thought of forsaking the poisonous comfort of their wrong\n\nhabits is actually shocking. Persons used to the darkness of bad habits natu-\nrally hate the light and comfort of good habits.\n\nENVIRONMENT Undiscriminating association with the world creates\nAND COMPANIONS bad habits in you, but the world will not be responsi-\n\nble for your wrong actions springing from those\nhabits. Then why give all your time to the world? Reserve at least an hour\na day for actual soul-inspiring God-realization. Doesn't the Giver of the\nworld itself--of your family, money, everything--deserve one twenty-fourth\npart of your day?\n\nMaterial habits keep millions of people away from God. People of bad\nhabits seek bad company. People of worldly habits seek materially minded\ncompanions. People of meditative, peaceful habits seek the company of\nChristlike saints. There is one thing very good about bad habits: seldom do\nthey keep their promises. Bad habits are easily found to be habitual liars and\ndeceivers. That is why souls can never remain perpetually in bondage. Nev-\ner condemn the sinner, for he knows too well the fears and tortures of sin. Do\nnot drown him in your hatred, but give him a chance to have his own knocks;\nthen he will be only too willing to be lifted up.\n\nPeople do not intentionally turn to evil, nor do they really enjoy being\nevil. They are evil because they do not know the greater charm of good\nhabits, and are unable to compare and select the best. Or'they fall under the\n\n"}

Some people\nare evil owing to the precedence of evil in their environment in early life;\nand some people are evil because they do not know any better. People who\nare evil behave so because they wrongly think that through evil they will get\nhappiness easily. People cling to evil because they falsely magnify the dread\nand torture supposed to be involved in self-control. People are evil because\nthey think they are compelled to be so by the powerful influence of evil in-\nstincts, or wrong determinations.\n\nSENSE SLAVERY If you are a slave to your senses, you cannot be happy.\n\nIf you are a master of your desires and appetites, you\ncan be a really happy person. If you overeat against your will; if you wish\nanything contrary to your conscience; if you act wrongly, forced by your\nsenses, against the wish of your inner Self; then you cannot be happy. People\nwho are slaves to the senses find that their evil habits compel them to do\nthings which will hurt them. Stubborn bad habits bludgeon your will power\nevery time it tries to take the lead and guide your thoughts to the kingdom of\nright action. The remedy lies in rescuing your will power from the imprison-\ning power of the senses.\n\nAlmost every soul is a prisoner of the senses. The soul's attention is\nlured away from its inner kingdom in the medulla oblongata, the spiritual eye,\nand the spinal plexuses, to the outer regions of the body, where greed, temp-\ntation, and attachment have their strongholds. The devotee who wants to lead\nKing Soul away from the misery-making slums of the senses finds that he can-\nnot do so without a severe clash between the lurking robbers of sense attach-\nment and the soul's divine soldiers of wisdom and self-control.\n\nEVIL HABITS CANNOT You must cure yourself of evil habits by cauterizing\nHOLD ONE FOREVER them with the opposite good habits. For instance,\n\nif you have a bad habit of telling lies and by so doing\nhave lost many friends, start the opposite good habit of telling the truth. It\ntakes time to form either a good habit or a bad one. It is difficult for a bad\nperson to be good, or for a good person to be bad; yet, remember that once\nyou become good, it will be natural and easy for you to be good. Likewise, if\nyou cultivate an evil habit, you will be compelled eventually to be evil, in\nspite of your desire, and you will have to pray: ''Father, my spirit is willing,\nbut my flesh is weak. । That is why it is worthwhile to cultivate the habit of\nbeing good and happy. People seeking happiness must avoid the influence of\nbad habits which lead to evil actions. Evil actions produce misery sooner or\nlater. Misery corrodes body, mind, and soul like a burning acid, and cannot\nbe endured long. |\n\nI do not believe that any human being really means to be evil. The crim-\ninal does wrong because there is no realization, deep in his consciousness, of\nthe true joy of right living. He is unable to see how he hurts himself through | ।\nhis errors; he would not want to commit error if he could really understand\n\n"}

That is\nwhy Jesus said: \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\" If\nthe criminal could compare his evil way with the right way of living--by actu-\nal experience--would he still continue to follow evil? No. We are all seek-\ning happiness.\n\nEvil cannot keep man under the influence of error forever, because he is\nmade in the image of God. In the beginning, the spiritual aspirant finds his\nsoldiers of discrimination guided by the desire to be good. Later, as he med-\nitates longer and prays ardently for inner help, he finds that a veteran occult\ngeneral--the calm conviction of inborn intuition, or awakening inner light--\nemerges from the superconscious to guide the forces of discrimination. The\nemergence of this awakening inner light is the result of good habits of the past.\n\nCULTIVATE The power of habit can be especially advantageous on the\nSPIRITUAL spiritual path. If one is accustomed to meditating and con-\nHABITS tacting God, one will greatly desire to meditate longer and\n\nmore often in order to contact God more frequently. Those\nwho meditate little, and vaguely feel they may someday contact God, find that\ntheir desire to do so vanishes when they are invaded by the powerful habit of\nrestlessness. Likewise, those who are accustomed to being calm attract\nmore calmness and serenity, while those who are seldom calm find their\n\n_precarious calmness easily disturbed when restlessness invades. Deep-\n\nseated unspiritual habits can entirely destroy the power of weak spiritual\nhabits.\n\nHabits of thought are mental magnets that attract specific things relative\nto their kind and quality. Material habits will always bring material results,\nand spiritual habits attract spiritual results.\n\nDon't let unhealthful ideas float down the stream of your habit-forming\nthoughts. Watch the quality of the books you read. Watch the kind and quali-\nty of the people with whom you associate. Watch the influence upon yourself\nof family, business associates, and close friends who constantly associate\nwith you. Many people are unsuccessful because their families have infected\nthem and their subconscious minds with habit-forming, progress-paralyzing,\ndiscouraging thoughts.\n\nWhen one meditates often and cultivates the taste for peace and content-\nment, and gradually forsakes indulgence in sense pleasures, he has a better\nchance for spiritual emancipation. The best way of all is to cultivate the\nhabit of contacting superior soul pleasures through meditation, immediately\nupon awakening. Then, while filled with the superior joy of the soul, you may\nenjoy such innocent, harmless pleasures of the senses as eating, meeting\nfriends, and so on, without any sense attachment. In this way the soul will\nspiritualize, or change the quality of, all material enjoyments.\n"}

A per-\nson who is always restless, and never meditates, thinks that he is all right\nbecause he has become accustomed to being a slave of restlessness. However,\nas soon as he tries to meditate and be calm, he finds resistance fromthe bad\nhabit of mental fickleness. But after he has formed the habit of meditation,\nhe learns that when the habit of restlessness tries to usurp the throne of his\nconsciousness, it finds the new meditation-guard and the awakened occult\nsoldiers of past lives offering resistance.\n\naK\nTHOUGHTS TO REMEMBER\n\nYou are the sole creator of good or bad habits. Therefore till the soil of\nyour mind with discipline, and sow the seeds of good habits. To replenish\nyour mind thoroughly with good habits you must be patient in cultivating them,\nwhile you continuously keep weeding out the bad habits.\n\nDistinguish between the soul's lasting happiness and the temporary plea-\nsures of the senses. Strengthen your willpower. Do not be enslaved by bad\nhabits, but be guided by good habits, formed through cultivating good company\nand practicing meditation. Above all, be guided by wisdom. Stay away from\nevil by exercising good judgment and discrimination; do not allow yourself to\nbe compelled by habits. Exercise your power of free choice to adopt the good\nin everything.\n\naK\nTHE MAN WHO THOUGHT THAT HE WAS PROOF AGAINST TEMPTATION\n\nMr. J. was a confirmed drunkard, a nuisance to his family and to his\nneighbors. One day he meta saint. The experience was so uplifting that he\ntook a vow to abstain from drinking. He asked his servants to hide his costly\nwines in locked boxes and to keep the key, instructing them to serve the wine\nonly to his friends. Everything went along all right with Mr. J. for some\ntime because of his joy in the power of his new resolution against drink. For\na while he did not feel at all the gripping lure of the liquor habit.\n\nAs time went on, he began to feel wholly proof against temptation to\ndrink. He asked his servants to leave the key to the wine room with him so\nthat he could serve the red liquid to his friends himself. Feeling more and\nmore mental security, he came to the conclusion that it was too much to\nbother to go to the cellar to get liquor for his friends; he would keep a few\nbottles upstairs in a cupboard.\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 121, "text": "8-1 P-15 7\n\nSeveral days passed without mishap, and Mr. J. thought: \"Since Iam\nproof against the temptation to drink, let me look at the sparkling red wine in\nthe bottle. '' So he had the wine decanter filled and placed onatable. Every\nday he looked at the bottle. Then he thought: \"Since Iam absolutely proof\nagainst the temptation, I may just as well enjoy the smell of the wine.\"\n\nA few more days passed by. Then he thought: \"Since Iam no longer\nbound by the sense of taste and therefore no longer care for wine, I will prove\nit to myself by taking a mouthful, tasting it, and then spitting it out.'' He did\nthis. Then he thought: \"Since Iam now so strong, Iam surely proof against\nliquor. There can be no harm if I drink once and swallow a little. '' He tried\nthis. Then he thought: 'Since I have conquered the wine habit, let me take\nonly one swallow at a time, as many times as my unenslaved will desires.\"\nIn no time at all he was drunk--and he helplessly kept on drinking every day,\njust as he had done before.\n\nThe preceding story shows how the liquor-drinking habit of Mr. J. was\nput down temporarily by the strong resolution to conquer. But success was\nnot lasting because Mr. J. failed to realize that his resolution against drink-\ning liquor had not had enough time to ripen into a good habit.\n\nIt takes from five to eight years to substitute a good habit for a strong\n\nbad habit. Until the strong good habit is formed, one should stay away from\n\nhis former evil habit-forming environment or actions. Our story shows the\nresults when one disregards this law: Mr. J. brought his wine bottle near\nhim, and gradually reawakened the memory of the drinking habit, and with it\nhis former uncontrollable desire for liquor.\n\nTherefore, to prevent the nourishment of bad habits, one should get away\nfrom surroundings that encourage him in wrong actions, and, above all, one\nshould never deliberately bring evil thoughts into the mind. Resist evil\nthoughts, which lead one to seek evil surroundings.\n\nMr. J. not only made a mistake in bringing liquor so near him; he also\nfailed to recognize the psychological weapons that his bad habit used to defeat\nhis good resolution. The liquor habit remained unseen, hidden in his subcon-\nscious mind, secretly sending out armed spies of desire and pleasing thoughts\nof taste to prepare the way for reinvasion. Thus the liquor habit came back\nand usurped the free will of Mr. J., enslaving body and soul.\n\nAnyone who has a tendency to live on the misery-producing material\nplane should learn to stay away from tempting environments outside and to\ncast out thoughts of temptation from within. He should surround himself with\nthe right kind of environment, and keep his mind filled with the kind of\nthoughts that will produce the good effect he truly desires.\n\nगुनु\n"}

Businessmen or\nartists or students in school as well as spiritual seekers must know the art\nof focusing all the powers of attention upon a single point in order to succeed\nin their respective vocations. Concentration denotes first the withdrawal of\nthe attention from objects of distraction and then focusing of that recalled\nattention upon one thing ata time. The primary factor in concentration con-\nsists in withdrawing the attention from all diverting objects.\n\nDuring the practice of concentration and meditation, environment is\nextremely important in gaining the best results. There are two kinds of\nenvironment: inner and outer.\n\nOuter environment is one's physical surroundings (noisy or quiet,\nand so forth), and inner environment is one's mental state (distracted or\nserene).\n\nYou can be mentally restless even while sitting in a very quiet place with\nthe body motionless and relaxed. It is therefore necessary to calm yourself\ninteriorly, whether outer conditions are suitable or not, before real concen-\ntration can begin. Quiet places are naturally conducive to inner calmness,\n\nbut if you are determined, you can remain inwardly undisturbed regardless\nof any commotion around you.

A small room with one or more\nwindows, or a closet with a window, ora screened-off corner, or any quiet\nroom that is neither too warm nor too cold, or a mountaintop or forest in the\nsummer--~any one of these is suitable for meditation. Even when riding in an\nautomobile or train, or if you sleep in the same room with others, you can\nstill practice meditation while pretending to be asleep.\n\nIf possible, select a noiseless place. In your small meditation room or\nscreened-off corner put a straight armless chair facing east. This will be\nyour asan, your meditation seat. Place on it a woolen blanket so as to cover\nthe back and the seat and run down on the floor under your feet. The blanket\nmay be covered with a silk cloth also, if you wish.

Six\nhours of sleep is plenty for most adults. Wake up at 5:30 a.m. and meditate.\nThis time is suitable because your home and the neighborhood are usually\nquiet then. Metaphysically this is suitable because the rays and vibrations of\nthe dawn are vitalizing and spiritually uplifting.

A\nbalanced control of these four bodily forces brings quick spiritual results\nwithout any downfall or hindrance. In fact, every spiritual student can attain\na concentrated mind just by the single, separate control of any one of the four\nbodily factors. For example, by strict celibacy alone, one can gain great\nmental concentration.\n\nHowever, the balanced way to Self-realization consists in practicing\nexercises and principles that simultaneously control and harmonize breath,\nlife force, mind, and vital power. Therefore, every spiritual aspirant should\npractice certain breathing exercises, special techniques controlling energy\nflowing in the sensory motor nerves, methods of mental meditation, and prin-\nciples of calmness-producing celibacy (or for those who are married, sexual\nmoderation). Students who meditate regularly without striving to calm the\nrestless breath or control the life force and vital essence, often find insur-\nmountable difficulties on the spiritual path.\n\nIf one's life force is restless, he is nervous and keeps his body in con-\nstant motion; then his mind is restless, vitality is restless, and breath is\nrestless. But if one controls the life force by spiritual exercises and the\n\nwithin his control.\n\nIf the breath is restless, as in running, then the life force, mind, and\nvital essence will be restless. On the other hand, if breath is made calm\nand rhythmic by the practice of these Lessons, the life force, mind, and sex-\nual instincts will be under control. Again, if the mind is restless, the life\nforce through nervousness and physical desire becomes restless. Mental\ncalmness is usually attended by calm nerves, controlled bodily energy, and\n2. well-regulated moral life. Loss of vitality--resulting from living too much\non the physical plane--produces mental dissatisfaction, melancholia, peevish-\nness, nervousness, and heavy restless breath.\n\nBy proper breathing exercises and by attaining control of breath, one\ncan achieve a state of deep concentration. By control of the life force in the\nsensory motor nerves~-~pranayama, as taught in the higher Self-Realization\nFellowship Lessons--one can withdraw the currents from the senses and pre-\nvent disturbing sensations from reaching the brain, thus calming the mind.\nBy mental concentration and self-control, as in meditation, one finds the\nbreath and the life force automatically calmed, and thus stability is attained.\n\nThe real spiritual teacher knows that the safest, quickest and best spiri-\ntual method for the beginner lies in learning harmonization of these four bodi-\nly factors. Some people perform breathing exercises without realizing their\n\n"}

Others try to approach God by controlling the life\n\nforce in the body; but, forgetting the divine conception of the astral technique\n--pranayama--they satisfy themselves with certain mental and astral powers\n\nand forget God entirely.

One kind develops more or less by\nindirection, whena person tries to get his mind off a certain thing. The more he\ntries not to think about it, the more concentrated on it his thought becomes.\n\nThis is not real concentration, as it is not under the control of the will. Scien-\ntific concentration, on the other hand, enables you to throw your attention at will\non the object of concentration and to hold it there uninterruptedly for as long as\nyou wish. Self-Realization Fellowship teaches you a scientific method of doing\nthis.\n\nSOME ARE \"Well, '' you may say, ''many people do succeed in concentra-\nSUCCESSFUL ting on each problem as it arises. They know how to keep\n\ntheir minds on the subject at hand and shut out all extraneous\nthoughts, even though they were never taught to concentrate, and have never seen\nSelf-Realization Fellowship instructions. '' This is true; all successful people\nhave good powers of concentration.\n\nThen why should such people bother with any ''method\" of concentration?\nBecause successful people have developed this power of concentration in the past,\nor in this life, by constant friction with difficult problems. By utilizing their\npreviously acquired ability scientifically, they can increase their successes. For\ninstance, one can reason without learning logic, but the clear-thinking man who\nadds logic to his mental tool -kit has an advantage over the one who knows nothing\nofthe laws pertaining to forms of reasoning.\n\nThe ordinary successful businessman uses only about twenty-five percent\nof his powers of concentration, but the student of Self-Realization Fellowship\ncan develop his power of concentration to one hundred percent usefulness and\nexert it scientifically. In addition--and this is most important--he will be led\ninto the art of meditation and learn to balance material success with spiritual\nsuccess.\n\nBy the practice of meditation man learns how to throw his thought concen-\ntratedly upon God and to appeal successfully to Him to recharge his concentra-\ntion with God's perfect concentration. Only then--when scientifically acquired\nhuman concentration is charged with the concentration of Spirit--can man expect\nto accomplish all things. That kind of concentration is required in order to\ndemonstrate successfully a command such as: \"0 ye mountains, go into the\ndepths of the 869 ! ''\n\n"}

Everyone can benefit\nfrom application of the scientific Self-Realization method of God-directed, God-\ncharged concentration: the busy housewife; the worry-burdened businessman;\nthe restless-minded type whose uncontrolled thoughts make him go like a jumping\njack; the devout churchman who is seeking greater knowledge; and the real spiri-\ntual aspirant--the yogi.\n\nThrough the voice of silence and peace God tries to speak to all His children\nin response to their prayers. But His voice is usually drowned out by rowdy\nsensations of touch, smell, taste, hearing, and sight, and by the tumult of sen-\nsation-and memory-roused thoughts. Finding the devotee's attention entangled\nin restlessness and engrossed with the incoming \"calls\" at the switchboard of\nsensation, God's voice recedes into the depths of silence.\n\nGod sadly turns away whenever He finds that His temple of concentration has\nbeen made a noisy place for the money-changers of material desires and sensa-\ntions. The Christlike guru-preceptor (intuition) must come with the whip of\nself-control to drive away the materially busy, restless thoughts, and make the\n\nInequalities in the power of concentration exhibited by various people are\nreflected in the differing degrees of success they achieve. Self-Realization\nFellowship teaches that by powerful concentration the businessman can increase\nhis success; the focused power of detached attention may similarly be applied to\nmaking a greater success of a home, an art, a profession, a church, or in estab-\nlishing a temple of silence in the soul. It is wrong, of course, to use high-\npowered concentration for self-success at the expense of others; one must know\nhow to guide and reinforce concentration with the just, unselfish, service-giving,\nsympathetic, superconcentration of God.\n\nSome persons who apply great concentration to become rich are satisfied to\nuse their high-powered minds for gaining material success, while turning a deaf\near to cries of misery from others. But the man charged with the superconcen-\ntration of God wants success only when others may benefit at the same time. He.\ntries to spiritualize the ideal of industry through service, and finds happiness\nthrough making others happy. Self-Realization Fellowship teaches the art of\nidealistic concentration for the good of self and all others.\n\nHK\n\nTHOUGHTS TO REMEMBER\n\nAlways reflect your balanced attitude toward others.

He called the principal\nof his story Madame Butterfly--though male students just as often have such\nexperiences in their unrewarding efforts at concentration.\n\nThe scene is Madame Butterfly's living room. The time, the middle of a\ncold winter afternoon. Since all the housework is done, and it's too dismal to\ngo anyplace, our friend has some of that ''spare time\" she's always looking for\nin order to practice concentration.\n\nShe sits down in a straight-backed chair. No sooner has her body touched\nthe chair than she exclaims. ''This seat is too hard! I should have a pillow.\" .\nShe finds one the right size and sinks down upon it. Then Madame Butterfly dis-\ncovers that the chair squeaks. Transferring pillow and body to another chair\nshe notices a draft, and closes the window. Next she develops a tendency to\nsneeze. But her handkerchief had dropped near the first chair. Her handker-\nchief reclaimed, Madame contentedly thinks, ''Now for a delightful dip into the\ndepths of concentration. ''\n\nA few moments pass, and her mind is just beginning to settle when the boil-\ning radiator begins to bubble. In disgust, she jumps up and roughly chokes the\n\n"}

Then, in the apartment next door, some-\none starts to play the piano, accompanied by laughter and loud talking.\n\nNow Madame Butterfly is both mad and disgusted. She considers pounding\non the wall, but after all, it is the middle of the afternoon, and so the neighbors\nhave a right to play if they wish. She begins to listen and to think: ''That's\nreally a good piano. '' Our friend then recalls other pianos she has heard. She\nremembers the pleasant days when she was a child and used to dance while her\ndear old grandmother played rustic airs popular in her own youth. She thinks\nof some of her grandmother's escapades as an attractive young belle.\n\nAnd so on and on, until suddenly Madame Butterfly remembers her original\npurpose of concentration and jerks herself from her sweet reveries. She tries\nto assume the saintly dignity of a veteran yogi, rebuking her body and mind for\ntheir restlessness.\n\nShe makes a desperate effort to regather the battered fragments of her self-\ncontrol. Her eyes have hardly closed again when the telephone crows out with\nimpudent, patience-piercing pertinacity. \"I will not answer it!'' But the imper-\ntinent bell continues. Madame Butterfly begins to doubt her wisdom. \"It might\n\n~be an important call,\" she thinks. So she gets up and answers the phone only to\n\nfind that someone has dialed the wrong number.\n\nThis ordeal over, she musters up enough courage to begin again. But now\nher head begins to nod. Her sense of shame at this is shoved aside by self-pity\nfor her exhausted condition. But forcing herself to sit straight, Madame tries\nagain.\n\nThis effort is diverted by the clamorous ringing of the hoarse-voiced door-\nbell. She remains still for a few moments, but the patience-breaking jangle\ngoes on until she begins to think again, \"It must be something important.'' Once\nat the door, however, Madame Butterfly assumes a galvanized smile as she\ngreets three feminine acquaintances, all of whom have a master's degree in the\nart of gossiping. Behind the artificial flower of her forced smile our friend hides\nthe stinging wasp of petulance, as she thinks: ''Oh you pests, why couldn't you\nhave stayed away and let me concentrate?\"\n\nHappily oblivious to this, the three visitors enter and busy themselves raking\nand prodding in everyone else's dirt heaps--secure in the knowledge that for the\nmoment there is a \"keep off'' sign on their own. Madame Butterfly laughs pleas-\nantly, and three hours slip away before she has the relief of closing the door\nbehind these inordinate gossips.\n\nAutomatically she resumes her attempts at concentration. But now her\nattention is mobbed by memories of leaky radiators, piano-pounding, telephone\n"}

''What time is it anyway?'’ Madame looks at her watch, and witha\nresigned sigh, rises and starts to the kitchen to get supper.\n\nThe living room is empty again. And it might just as well have remained\nso all afternoon, as far as Madame Butterfly's efforts at concentration are con-\ncerned.\n\nThe above experience is not an exaggeration. It is only a sample of what\nhappens to most people when they attempt to concentrate.\n\na aK\nINSPIRATION\n\nIt is good to remember the following: seek intensely until you find God.\nKnock until the doors of all wisdom are opened unto you. Believe and act\naccording to your faith, until you know. Pray until He answers. Meditate deep-\ner and deeper, until you find and feel Him as unending joy. Love Him until you\nfeel His love. Talk to Him continuously in silence until He speaks to you.\nRemember, the so-called certainties of life--such as money, fame, and friends\n--are really the most difficult to retain. They may slip away any minute. So,\nmake the imperishable so-called unknown, uncertain God your own; you will find\nHim most faithful, when all else leaves you beyond the last gate of this life.\n\nsk\nAFFIRMATION\nI will open the only gate, the gate of\n\nmeditation, that leads to Thy blessed\npresence.\n\n=\n\n"}

God is reflected as soul in the lakes of consciousness in myriads of\nhuman beings--just as the one moon may be reflected in a million lakes. But\nbecause the lakes of human attention are rippling with sensations and thoughts\ncaused by the storms of breath and of mental restlessness, the soul-image of\nGod reflected there is distorted.\n\nWhen the Self-Realization Fellowship technique of concentration is suc-\ncessfully practiced, the waves of breath cease, owing to the restfulness of the\nheart; then the ripples of sensations and of restless thoughts vanish from the\nlake of attention, and the undisturbed reflection of the soulis seen. Patanjali\nemphasizes the negative side of concentration: that as soon as the attention is\nfree from the objects of distraction, it can reveal the soul, just as the remov-\nal of the hand from in front of the lens of a flashlight reveals the things in\nfront of it in the dark.\n\nJesus said: \"If thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast\nthem from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather\nthan having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. And if thine\neye offend thee, pluck it ००७४\" (Matthew 18:8, 9).\n\nIn these words are hidden a Biblical definition of concentration. Jesus\nmeant that every devotee must know how to concentrate and do away with all\ndistractions of sensations such as touch (''thy hand\") and sight (''thine eye\").\nThe devotee must know how to calm the senses, i.e., take consciousness away\nfrom them, and how to withdraw the life force from the sensory-motor nerves,\nwhich are the conductors of disturbing sensations. Thus he will know how to\nenter the eternal life, the ever conscious, ever existing, ever new bliss of\nthe soul. The life force in the nerves keeps the soul entangled with messages.\nof sensations from the eyes, ears, hands, and so forth; but when the life force\nis plucked from the eyes and cut off from the hands, and from all conscious-\nness of the body, the soul's attention becomes freed from the distracting\n\n"}

Then the soul becomes cognizant of its divine nature.\nOnly then is a state of complete concentration reached.\n\nThe following is a psychologically sound and scientific definition of con-\ncentration:\n\nConcentration is that power which one can apply negatively to free\nthe attention from objects of distraction, and positively to place the\nattention on a single idea or object at a time.\n\nWhen the attention is freed from minor distractions, it may be directed to act\npositively by focusing its rays on any kind of problem, or upon God. It is all\nright to say that a person is concentrating on how to make more money in bus-\niness, or that he is concentrating on God; but you should not say, ''He is medi-\ntating on his business problems.'' For real meditation, as taught to Self-\nRealization students, is that specific form of concentration which is applied\n\nonly to knowing God.\n\nMany students try ineffectually to meditate, to think about God, but they\nare still hypnotized by restlessness and cannot forget their surroundings. In\norder to get results, one must learn how to detach his attention from distract-\ning thoughts and sensations and apply it to God. No meditation is possible\n\nwithout knowing the art of concentration. Prayer, chanting, and singing all be-\n\ncome a mockery without application of the positive and negative factors of con-\ncentration and meditation.\n\nAll people need to know the art of concentration in order to gain real suc-\ncess, each in his own respective path. No one can concentrate deeply upon\nGod, art, business--or anything else--without first disengaging his attention\nfrom outer and inner distraction. Hence a scientific technique of freeing one's\nattention from the objects of distraction is the only way to get results. How\nhopeless it is for either the housekeeper, the businessman, or the spiritual\naspirant to try to concentrate by employing the popular way of mental diver-\nsion! The student who wishes to learn real concentration should begin by\nlearning two things:\n\n1) What the objects of distraction are.\n2) How the attention can be scientifically switched off from them.\n\nMany men and women believe that prayer takes the place of concentration.\nThis is true only when the laws of prayer are followed. Most people who try\nto contact God do so unscientifically, and hence ineffectively, either by blind\ndevotion or by intellectual investigation. Of course, if the prayer is intense,\nthe attention automatically disengages itself from objects of distraction and\nfocuses itself upon God; then one has true concentration. But the program of\nworship in most cases consists in a variety of physical ceremonies, such as\nsinging hymns and listening to sermons; the attention has no opportunity to go\n\n"}

Such a person does not try to understand the pow-\ner behind his brain, without which no gainful or pleasurable activity can be\ncarried on.\n\nThe second state is reached when a person, by occasional concentration\non higher things, tries once in a while to get away from his preoccupation with\nthe sensory world.\n\nThe third state is reached by deeper concentration; the yogi arrives ata\nmiddle point wherein he enjoys glimpses of inner Bliss; his spiritual and mater-\nial tendencies are now evenly = as a result of steady effort at concen-\ntration and of proper schooling in the habits of silent concentration.\n\nThe fourth state comes when the consciousness becomes completely identi-\nfied with the only good or God, and the yogi goes beyond the oppositional states\nof good and evil. .Awakening in God, the yogi finds that the dual states of good\nand evil have vanished, just as sorrowful or joyous dream experiences of dis-\nease and health, bereavement and fulfillment vanish upon one's awakening\nfrom sleep.\n\nPORTRAIT OF AN UNSUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN\n\nHe gulps down an inadequate breakfast, hurries to his office, and sits at\n\n"}

The\nSILENCE soul's hunger cannot be satisfied by material substi-\n\ntutes nor by theological chaff. Some modern religious\nmovements are adopting ''going into the silence\" in their program of Sunday\nworship. But ''going into the silence, '' though it brings some peace, does\nnot teach the groping spiritual aspirant how to commune with God. ''Going\ninto the silence,\" by diverting and silencing thoughts, is only a negative factor\nof concentration and a slow method of establishing God-contact.\n\nThe difference between spoken prayer and silence is considerable: In\naudible prayer the mind is busy with sounds and bodily motions, as well as\nwith restless thoughts. In ordinary silence, the mind is kept partially quieted\nby keeping the body still, and the optic telephone is cut off by the closing of\nthe eyes. But the thoughts within may still run wild. Some people succeed\nin silencing their thoughts for a moment or two, and get a little glimpse of the\npeaceful face of God through this temporary crack in the wall of restlessness.\nBut often a real seeker is confronted by darkness, with only an occasional |\n\nglimpse of peace, which is soon broken by the disturbance of restless thoughts.\n\nHe begins to wonder, ' {8 this all there is to God and His inspiration? 11\n\nWhen he opens his eyes and gets out of this state of negative silence, at\nfirst he is filled with a new sense of wonder at the glory and immensity of\nsunlight; at the mysterious power of electricity that causes the trolley cars\nto run hither and yon; at the marvel of skyscrapers; at the lightning searing\nthe sky; at the powerful light of the moon. But as he experiences only a\nlittle occasional peace in the silence, he gradually finds less and less conso-\nlation in the powers and manifestations of nature. Soon he begins to belittle\nhis strivings for more spirituality and his inner experiences during periods\nof silence.\n\n"}

In these Self-Realiza-\ntion Fellowship studies you will learn how to produce scientifically a positive\nstate of meditative silence, and thus quiet all thoughts and sensations. There\nare higher states of concentration, and as the devotee ascends to them, one\nby one, he comes into higher and higher spheres of indescribable joys and\nuplifting experiences and visions. He blissfully realizes: ''He whom I was\nseeking in the cloud-forests of the blue is here with me, within me. I\nsought Him as a Power without, only to find that He--the fountain of all\nnature's forces-- exists within me. In the silence, just behind the walls of\ndarkness, I adoringly perceive Him.\"\n\nTo perceive God, one must first learn the positive and negative factors\nof silence. It is necessary to analyze the definite psychophysical elements\nof distraction that invade silence as one's attention tries to march toward its\nmental objective.\n\nSENSATIONS For example, as soon as you sit to concentrate upon your\nbusiness in the office, your attention is busy with the noise\nof typewriters and other office equipment, or with the roar\n\nof streetcars and automobiles in the street outside, intruding on your con-\n\nsciousness through the auditory nerve wires. Touch sensations of comfort\n\n(pleasurable feelings of the flesh such as after-dinner satisfaction, or abun-\ndant vitality, and so forth) or of discomfort (disagreeable feelings such as\nitches, aches, binding of tight clothing, perspiration, heat, cold, hunger,\nand weariness) pour into the brain through the tactual nerve wires. Or your\nattention may become preoccupied with the body odors of nearby persons, or\nwith the fragrance of flowers in the room, or the perfume used by someone\nnear you--sensations that keep crowding into your brain through your olfac-\ntory nerve wires\n\nOr your attention may be busy with visual sensations being reported to\nyour brain through your optic nerve telephones: the sight of your office\nfurnishings, or others' apparel. Your attention may be busy with pleasant\nor unpleasant sensations of the palate: the taste of peppermint candy, or\nchewing gum, or an after-smoking taste, or the after-sensation of the taste\nof cold water that you may have drunk not long before. So you see that all\nthe while your attention wants to concentrate upon a problem, upon business,\nor upon God, it meets with many distractions caused by sensations of sight,\nhearing, taste, touch, and smell.\n\nTHOUGHTS EVOKED But the five kinds of distractions just enumerated\nBY SENSATIONS are not the only claims upon your attention. These\nsensations give rise to thoughts that lure the atten-\ntion away from its pursuit of concentration. For instance, when you hear a\nnoisy automobile outside the room in which you are trying to concentrate,\n\n"}

The fragrance of flowers in the room may make you think\n\nof the florist's shop, or your grandmother's delightful garden. The sight of\n\nyour business office may make you think of grander. offices you have been in;\n\nand seeing the apparel of the people around, you may think of various kinds\n\nof clothes you would like to own.\n\nPAST THOUGHTS Thus sensations give rise to thoughts. Fresh\nROUSED BY thoughts arising from sensations may then rouse\nPRESENT THOUGHTS related thoughts in your subconscious memory.\n\nFor instance, the sound of automobiles around\nyour place may not only rouse many thoughts about other models of automo-\nbiles, but these, in their turn, may rouse in your consciousness latent\nthoughts of how you have driven many models of cars, or remind you of a bad\naccident you had with a certain powerful car. So your attention generally\nmeets first with sensations, then with crowds of new thoughts, and finally\nwith memory thoughts waking from their subconscious slumber.\n\nDistractions--the enemies of attention-~are threefold:\n\nl. sensations;\n९. new thoughts roused by sensations;\n3. old memory thoughts roused by present thoughts.\n\nThe minute your attention wishes to march along the pathway of concentration\ntoward a definite goal, it is waylaid by these invisible bandits of distraction.\n\nPOPULAR WAY OF If you should ask how you can succeed when trying\nCONCENTRATION to concentrate upon a problem or upon a Sunday\nIS DIVERSION sermon, most persons would tell you to divert\n\nyour mind from the objects of distraction. But\nthis seldom works successfully; for whenever you try hard not to think about\na particular thing, your mind perversely dwells on it.\n\nIt is almost futile, for example, to try to divert your mind from a con-\nstantly ringing telephone bell when you are trying to concentrate. This is\nbecause, when the bell rings, the report of the sound is carried to the brain\nby the life force in the auditory nerves. Whether you wish to hear it or not,\nthe bell sound penetrating through your auditory nerves is bound to register\nin the brain.\n\nTrying to divert the attention from the disturbing sound ofa bell by think-\ning of something else during the attempt at concentration is unscientific.\nHowever, a man of habitually intense concentration habits may be able to turn\nhis. mind deeply enough within so as not to hear the ringing. The question then @\narises: What physiological changes occur in this man to permit such deep\n\n"}

I will ask him to teach me how to do it, and\nthat will save me all that money I annually spend on my European business\ntrips.\"\n\nHe wended his way toward the riverbank, where the levitating teacher was\ntemporarily encamped, and asked to be taught the art of levitation.\n\nThe master gave Tej Bahadur the following instruction: ''Son, every\nnight, dim the light in your bedroom, lock the doors, and, sitting erect ona\nstraight chair facing the east, with closed eyes mentally chant the holy word\nof the Cosmic Vibration--Om--for an hour. At the end of one month you will\nbe able to race through the air over land or water.\"\n\n"}

While you are mentally\nchanting and concentrating on 'Om,' be sure not to think of a monkey. \"\n\n\"That is simple, '' said the businessman. \"Of course I won't think of a\nmonkey.'' After saluting the saint, he returned home.\n\nEvening found Tej Bahadur closing the windows, pulling down the shades,\nand seating himself in a straight chair in his bedroom to practice the tech-\nnique of levitation. No sooner had he done so than the first thought that\nstruck him was: \"I must not think of a monkey!\"\n\nTwo minutes passed and several times Tej Bahadur warned himself\ninwardly: \"I must not think of a monkey.\"\n\nBy the time ten minutes had passed he had thought of all the different\nkinds of monkeys in South America, India, Africa, Sumatra, and still other\nplaces. Tej Bahadur was furious. He willed himself to banish the thoughts\nabout the monkeys, which were leaping in rapid procession through the win-\ndow of his helpless mind. At the end of an hour he found himself thinking\nof nothing but monkeys.

Speak to us!\n\nKOK\n\nFURTHER INSTRUCTIONS ON CONCENTRATION\n\nDuring slumber the life force is switched off from the sensory telephone\nreceivers of eyes, palate, nose, skin, and ears. A sleeping person does not\nhear the telephone bell because the sound cannot reach his brain. The opera-\ntor, intelligence, has unconsciously switched off the auditory nerve telephone\nalong with the others. If one can sleep at will, therefore, he can produce at\nwill unconscious sensory relaxation--or the switching off of the life force from\nthe sense telephones, and thus prevent the noises from entering his brain.\nThough sleep is a good method of getting away from constant noises passing\nthrough the auditory nerves, still it is an unconscious, passive method. One\ndoes not wish to sleep every time he desires to become really quiet.\n\nSelf-Realization Fellowship studies teach an easy but scientific method of\nconsciously disconnecting the life force from all the five sense telephones so\nthat the stimuli, and their resulting sensations, do not reach the brain at all.\nIf you learn to switch off the life force from the five sense telephones with\nwhich your operator, intelligence, is working, then you really remove the med-\nium through which sensory stimuli flow into the brain. The mechanical tele-\nphone receives and transmits messages along the same wire. But the bodily\nhouse has two sets of telephones quite separate from each other in their func-\ntions. Through the sensory nerves, or receiving telephones, the messages of\ntactual, gustatory, auditory, olfactory, and optical sensations are received in-\nto the brain by the operator, intelligence. Another operator, will power,\ntransmits messages of eye movement, nostril inflation, ear movement, or the\nmovements of the t ongue, or any muscles of the body, through another set of\nnerves called the motor nerves.\n\nBy the stillness of complete muscular relaxation--which necessitates\nlying down, so that no muscles are tensed--one can remove the life energy\nfrom the motor nerves and their connecting muscles. But this withdrawal of\nlife force from the muscles and motor nerves is not complete sensory relaxa-\ntion, for the five sense telephones are not shut off; one can still see, taste,\nhear, smell and be conscious of tactual sensation, even when one is muscular-\nly relaxed. How is it possible, then, to switch off the life force from the five\nnerve telephones scientifically and consciously? By quieting the dynamo of the\nheart, which controls the life force in the sense telephones. In sleep, your\nheart action slows down, and this helps to withdraw the life force from the five\nsense telephones, and also from the motor nerves. The heart is the dynamo,\n\n"}

When\nthe heart involuntarily stops, we die.\n\n@\n\nCONTROL THE But the yogis of India anciently found that it is possible by\nDYNAMO OF calmness, and at will, to switch off the energy from the\nTHE HEART heart without causing death; that one can die or live at\n\nwill, and conquer death. When the average man dies, his\nbody remains inert; he cannot recall to it the life force that has fled. But St.\nPaul, like the Hindu yogis, knew that by learning to control the heart one can\n1101611 daily. 'I protest by our rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord,\nI die daily'' (ICor. 15:31). In order to die daily, one has to live daily in the\nconsciousness of God's presence. When one learns to live and die at will, he\nbecomes free from the flesh.\n\nThrough this series of Lessons you can learn to quiet the heart by the use\nof a specific technique (Hong-Sau); and also by giving up worries and fears you\ncan control the life force that works in the five sense telephones. The heart\nof a mouse in a mousetrap beats two times faster than usual because of its in-\ntense fear. The hearts of the calm Napoleon and the Duke of Wellington are\nsaid to have beat only fifty times per minute. Children's heartbeats are much\nfaster than those of grown people. Their restlessness is the cause. Their\nsense telephones are always busy with outward stimuli. Children find it hard\nto quiet themselves, but as they attain adulthood they become calmer, and the\n\nछि .. heart beats.less frequently... ---- ~ ~ --- ~~ 5 . - [व le em -०--- tk ieee\n\nNormally the heart pumps eighteen tons of blooda day. If you worry, you\ntrouble the heart, and it beats faster. The poor overworked heart, which can-\nnot even rest while its owner sleeps, is a much-abused slave. Therefore when\nit has done enough, it says: ''You have been a bad master. Now 1 quit my job.\"\nAs a result of your heart's refusal to work, you have to do without the whole\nmachinery of your body.\n\nDo not be frightened, thinking that you are going to stop your heartbeat\npermanently when you practice these instructions. They are not givenasa\nconvenient means of suicide. If anyone wishes to stop the heartbeat and not re-\nvive it, he does not need to bother to study these Lessons, for he can more\neasily accomplish his purpose by jumping into a river.\n\nRemember, however, that psychologically a state of unconsciousness, or\npassive subconsciousness, should be avoided during the practice of the concen-\ntration technique. Also, physiologically, no strenuous method of holding the\nbreath should be used in an effort to stop the heartbeat unnaturally. It is abso-\nlutely impossible to stop the heartbeat that way. But by practice of the Hong-\nSau method described in the next Lesson, the heart becomes so restful; the\nlungs become so free from venous blood, that it is unnecessary for the heart\nto work. Then the heart rests because of its great calmness and the life force\n\n@ in the five sense telephones can gradually be brought under control.\n\n"}

His response is plain, never indefi-\nnite. Hold your mind radio tuned with soft touches of deepest devotion, of the\ngrandest, most constant love. Then suddenly He may burst upon you as a song\nor as a Cosmic Voice; or as the fragrance of a trillion mystic flowers. He\nmay softly dance on your bursting heart, or He may televise His message as a\nfire-mist aureole, dancing on the floor of your vision; or a million nectars\nmay invade your palate, or a sextillion sensations and perceptions of endless\nthrills of joy may dance on every sanctum of your body cells, on every blade\nof thought, on every open altar of your inspiration.\n\nNo matter what God broadcasts, remember that the surest sign of His\nPresence is the burst of the dawn of peace, which is the first messenger to\nherald His secret approach. Then peace bursts into more dazzling lights of\nendless joy. Then you are sure to behold Him in the light of increasing, ever\nnew, ever charming, ever entertaining joy. This joy is not a dream of fancy.\nYou can never bring this messenger unless you open the secret door of deep-\nest meditation. Through this majestic door of God-dreams joy comes, and in\nthe light of this joy alone can you behold the Mighty Deity spread over the sky-\ney blue vastness, in everything.\n\nThen, when the contact is made through increasing peace and joy, tell\nyour Father that you are no longer a prodigal son.

Teach me to breathe Thy breath in my own breathing.\n\nkkk\n\nTHE TECHNIQUE OF CONCENTRATION\n\nIt is necessary to keep the attention free from distraction during concen-\ntration. The mind of the average person is restless, even when he makes a real\neffort to concentrate. Try as he will to keep his attention focused on one ob-\nject of thought, his mind slips away and \"concentrates\" on everything else imag-\ninable. When the attention thus becomes enslaved unconsciously by objects of\ndistraction, efforts at concentration bear meager fruit.\n\nBREATH AND This SRF Lesson deals with the scientific approach to God:\nLIFE FORCE harmonizing breath, life force, and mind to achieve one-\npointed concentration on Him.\n\nControlling the life force in the body enables the yogi to switch off the\ncurrent from the sensory nerve telephones, thus making it impossible for dis-\nturbing sensations to reach the brain and distract the attention from its march\ntoward the Divine Goal.\n\nBreath is not life, but it is necessary to ordinary physical existence be-\ncause dark venous blood has to be purified by oxygen. Breath is the cord that\nties the soul to the physical body. One who can live without breath can free\nhis soul from slavery to the breath and hence from imprisonment in the body.\n\nBecause of the vital link between breath and life force, many persons\nthink that pranayama -- life-force control -- consists in holding the breath\nfor long periods. This is untrue. The mortal breath that binds the soul to the\nbody cannot be made to stop by forcibly holding it in the lungs, which is danger-\nous. Rather by stopping decay (the normal process of cellular breakdown) in\nthe system, and by developing calmness and practicing spiritual exercises such\nas Hong-Sau, yogis achieve the breathless state in a natural way. It is life\nforce that governs breath, heartbeat, sensory impressions, and motor responses\n-- all the functions of the body. Pranayama means control of that life force,\nand hence control over all the functions of the body.\n\nFUNCTION OF The first function of life force in the body is to supply\nLIFE FORCE energy directly to the brain. The all-surrounding Cosmic\nEnergy enters the brain through the medulla oblongata. From\nthe medulla, life energy is also transmitted to the heart, lungs, diaphragm --\nto every organ and every cell in the body. Life force is the electric power\nthat directly energizes the cells and keeps them functioning in a living way.\nFlowing into the body through the medulla, life force keeps the body battery\n\n"}

Breath, food, and sunshine are merely subsidiary sources of\nenergy; their breakdown by the activating life force creates additional elec-\ntrical power for the body battery.\n\nIf the battery in an automobile has gone dead, it can be reactivated only\nby newly charging it with electricity from an outside source. Similarly, a\ndead body battery can be revived only by a fresh charge of life force from the\ncosmic source. It is useless to fill the stomach of a dead person with food, or\nto pump oxygen into his lungs; food and oxygen sustain life only if life force\nis already actively present in the body.\n\nA storage battery could be used indefinitely if recharged by electricity,\nand if the physical characteristics of its positive and negative plates and the\nelectrolyte did not change. Similarly, by higher training the body may be sus-\ntained by the intelligent life force ES] which acts as the recharging elec-\ntricity and also prevents the deterioration of the physical properties of the\nbody battery.\n\nThe fact that human beings and animals in states of suspended animation\ncan maintain life indefinitely by spinal and mental energy, shows that life\nforce itself is the only essential to sustaining life. Hindu saints have been\nburied alive beneath the ground for as long as several months -- even years --\nwithout food or oxygen, and after disinterment have regained consciousness and\n` resumed ndrmal life है ~ ~\n\nIn mortal existence, however, the life energy in the body, instead of\ndrawing directly upon its source -- the inexhaustible Cosmic Energy -- distills\nenergy from food, and thus comes to depend on being sustained by food. But food\nis not the cause of the presence of life force in the body; it is merely one of\nthe conditions by which mortal life exists.\n\nWithout light, reading a book is impossible; but the reading matter is\nnot caused by the light. Likewise, without food, existence is ordinarily im-\npossible; yet food is not the cause that creates life. Through the habit of in-\ncarnations the body has become used to depending upon food and breath to main-\ntain life. The more the body is trained to live by life force, the less it need\ndepend upon food and oxygen.\n\nTHE FUNCTION The function of breath is to supply oxygen to the body.\n\nOF BREATH Breath indirectly supplies energy to the body by the explo-\nsion of oxygen into atoms of life force. Passing through the\n\nwalls of the lungs into the blood stream, oxygen changes dark, waste-carrying\n\nvenous blood into vitalizing red arterial blood.\n\nThe greater the amount of venous blood, the greater the necessity for\nbreath. If there is no venous blood in the body (as in suspended animation\nwhen, through the prevention.of waste-creating activity of bodily tissues, con-\nscious rest is given to the bodily cells) there is no necessity for breathing.\nFor this reason the Hindu masters taught control of the life force in the heart\n\n"}

Yogis accom-\nplish this by eating only pure foods that produce little waste in the body, and\nby practicing scientific spiritual methods of calming the physical and mental\nprocesses -- methods such as the SRF Recharging Exercises and concentration\ntechniques.\n\nCALMNESS OF HEART AND The prevention of cell decay in the tissues\nBREATH NECESSARY FOR means that the heart does not have to pump im-\nPERFECT CONCENTRATION purities-laden venous blood into the lungs for\n\ncleansing; nor to send oxygen-laden red blood to\nfeed the bodily tissues. When the deteriorating process in the body is thus\nhalted, and there is no venous blood to be pumped into the lungs, the heart 8€~\ncomes naturally and completely calm.\n\nThe yogi who has thus calmed the heart also finds that the absence of\nvenous blood in the lungs, and the state of suspended animation of the bodily\ntissues, makes superfluous the absorption of oxygen from the air into the blood\nstream. Breathing simply becomes unnecessary.\n\nBREATHLESSNESS The Hong-Sau Technique enables its practitioners to @\nIS DEATHLESSNESS solve the mystery of breath by doing away with breath.\nOnly those who properly regulate the breath -- that\nis, are able to do without breath at will by practice of a scientific technique\nsuch as Hong~Sau -- can attain Self-realization. If you can do without breath,\nyou can control bodily life, prolong it, and rise beyond it to soul awareness in\nthis life. To do without breath is to exist comfortably without feeling any\nneed to breathe; going without breath does not mean forcing or suppressing air\nin the lungs.\n\nWatching the breath is the preliminary step in controlling it; then the\nconsciousness gradually realizes itself as distinct from the involuntary\nbodily function of breathing, and separates itself from the breathing function.\nThe yogi who has gained breath-control is then able to recognize that conscious-\nness is the only thing that is real about his existence. By training his con-\nsciousness according to the method to be described in this Lesson, the student\nbegins to realize that his life is not dependent upon bodily functions, and\nthat his real nature is spiritual and immortal. Thus he understands the delu-\nsive nature of ego consciousness which causes us erroneously to identify our-\nselves with the body instead of realizing the divine nature of our being:\nsatchitananda -- eternal existence (sat), eternal consciousness (chit), eter-\nnal joy (ananda).\n\nTHE BIBLE AND \"Man (man’s body battery) shall not live (cannot be @\nTHE HINDU sustained) by bread alone (by solid and liquid food\nSCRIPTURES AGREE and oxygen only), but by every word (unit of life\n\n"}

The life energy that transforms\nfood into energy is the real sustainer of life. According to the Hindu scrip-\ntures, the food of the future will be almost solely this life energy from the\ncosmos. When man’s body, mind, and soul batteries run down, they will be re-\ncharged directly by cosmic energy.\n\nThe following important results follow upon attainment of the breathless\nstate:\n\n1. The heart calms down and switches off energy from the five sense\ntelephones, thus helping concentration.\n\n2. The noise of the bodily machinery is stopped.\n\n3. The process of cellular decay in the internal organs is stopped.\n\n4. One realizes that the body lives by cosmic energy coming through\nthe medulla oblongata.\n\n5. One learns to live by Cosmic Consciousness and not by \"bread\" or\nbreath alone.\n\n6.

Inattention during the practice of these\nexercises brings on sleep. Concentrated attention will bring a tingling sense\nof divine life to every body cell.\n\nWhen practicing this technique of concentration, it is a good idea to sit\non a straight-backed chair with a woolen blanket placed over it. The blanket\nshould run down under the feet, insulating the body from earthly magnetic in-\nfluences and disturbances. Face east and sit erect, without touching your\nspine to the back of the chair. Always keep the spine and head in a straight\nvertical line during practice. The body should be relaxed, with the hands rest-\ning palms upward on the thighs.\n\nHONG-SAU TECHNIQUE With eyelids completely closed, or half closed,\n\nOF CONCENTRATION focus your gaze at the seat of the spiritual eye, be-\ntween the eyebrows. From that center of calmness\n\nand concentration, mentally watch (be aware of) the natural flow of your breath\n\ncoming in and going out. Do not in any way use mental will or force to draw\n\nyour breath in or to send it out. Try to feel as detached about it as you would\n\nif you were merely observing someone else’s breathing.\n\nAs the breath comes in, mentally chant \"Hong\" (rhymes with song), at the\nsame time move the index finger of your right hand toward the palm. As the\nbreath goes out, mentally chant \"Sau\" (rhymes with saw) and move the index fin-\nger away from the palm.\n\nThe movement of the index finger is only to help you to differentiate in-\n\n"}

If you have no difficulty in mentally differentiating inhala-\ntion and exhalation, or in chanting the right word with each (\"Hong\" with inhala-\ntion, \"Sau\" with exhalation), the movement of the index finger is unnecessary.\n\nThere should be no movement of the tongue as you mentally chant the words\n“Hong” and \"Sau.\"\n\nEvery sound in the universe has a different mental correspondence and men-\ntal effect. \"Hong\" and \"Sau\" are two sacred Sanskrit chant words that have a vi-\nbratory connection with the incoming and outgoing breath. The mental repeti-\ntion of \"Hong\" with the inhaling breath and of \"Sau\" with the exhaling breath\nhas a markedly calming mental effect and thus helps the student to concentrate\nin this exercise of watching the incoming and outgoing breath.\n\nBy correct, continued practice you will feel a great calmness; gradually\nyou will realize your true identity as soul, superior to and existing indepen-\ndently of your physical body.\n\nHONG-SAU MAY BE Practice this Hong-Sau Technique during your daily\nPRACTICED morning and evening meditation period. In addition,\nANYTIME you may also practice it during leisure periods, or\n\nwhen you are traveling in a bus or streetcar, or when-\never you are sitting anywhere doing nothing else. When practicing Hong-Sau in\npublic, do so without moving the finger or closing the eyes or fixing the gaze\nbetween the eyebrows (which might attract the attention of people around you!);\njust watch the breath and mentally chant \"Hong\" with each inhalation and \"Sau\"\nwith each exhalation. Keep the eyes open, gazing calmly ahead at some particu-\nlar point. Restless movements of the eyes reflect the restlessness of the\nthoughts in the mind; and if the eyes are gazing about taking in various objects\nor scenes, these sight perceptions give rise to further restless thoughts.\n\nIn leisure moments, you may even lie down on your back, if you wish, and\npractice Hong-Sau, though in the supine position one is more susceptible to\nfalling asleep. As a general rule, however, Hong-Sau should be practiced in\nthe correct upright meditation posture.\n\nBEST TIME TO PRACTICE There are four periods during each day that\nCONCENTRATION TECHNIQUE have a vibratory correspondence with the four\n\nseasons of the year; early morning is spring,\nnoon is summer, early evening is autumn, and midnight is winter. Four changes\ntake place in the body during these four magnetic seasons of the day. The SRF\nexercises and techniques neutralize the effects 07 the body of the four chang-\ning periods by vitalizing and magnetizing the body with life currents and with\nCosmic Consciousness. These currents arrest change and suspend the decaying\nprocess in the cells.\n\nTherefore it is best to practice this changelessness-producing technique\n(Hong-Sau) at these four periods of the day to obtain satisfactory scientific\n\n"}

Meditate between 5 and 6 a.m., 11 and 12 a.m., 5 and 6 p.m., and 10\nand 12 p.m. (or between 11 and 12 p.m.).\n\nThe purpose of Hong-Sau practice is to gain conscious passivity, and to\nfree the attention from sense entanglements. Under the spell of maya -- cosmic\ndelusion -- man identifies himself with the physical body, which lives in and\nrequires the atmosphere of air, just as a fish needs the environment of water.\nBreath is the cord that binds the soul to the body. When man learns to rise\nabove the need for breath, he ascends into the celestial realms of angels.\n\nAs he watches the course of the incoming and outgoing breath, the yogi\nfinds that his breath naturally slows down and calms the relatively violent ac-\ntion of the heart, lungs, and diaphragm.\n\nHONG-SAU RESTS The most overworked organ in the body is the heart, which\nTHE HEART pumps about eighteen tons of blood a day and has no rest\n\nat night as the other organs have. The Hong-Sau Tech-\nnique is a scientific method for resting the heart. Its practice thus in-\ncreases longevity and liberates a tremendous amount of life current, which is\ndistributed all over the body, recharging, revitalizing, and renewing all body\ncells and preventing their decay. This marvelous Hong-Sau Technique is one of\nthe greatest contributions of India’s spiritual science to the world: it\nteaches one how to lengthen the span of life, and is a simple and practical\n——~jethod of rising above body consciousnéss and realizing oneself as immortal |\nSpirit.\n\nIn sleep we experience sensory relaxation. In death, complete relaxation\ninvoluntarily takes place, owing to the stopping of the heart’s action. If one\ncan learn to control the heartbeat, he can experience conscious death, as did\nSt. Paul (\"I die daily\" -- I Corinthians 15:31) and many yogis of India who have\npracticed this Hong-Sau Technique, and through it achieved mastery over the ac-\ntion of the heart. Since ancient times India’s great yogis have known how to\nleave the body voluntarily, honorably, and gladly; they were not thrown out\nroughly, or taken by surprise by death at the expiration of the leases on their\nbody temples.\n\nWhen the heart rests, breath becomes unnecessary. Life energy then with-\ndraws from the heart and sensory nerves into the spine and brain. This discon-\nnects the telephones of the five senses, whose incessant messages from the out-\nside world ordinarily keep the ego continually disturbed and the attention\nscattered. Through sensory disconnection by practice of Hong-Sau, sensations\ncease to arouse thoughts, which in turn cease to arouse the subconscious mind\nby associated thoughts. The attention thus becomes scientifically free from\nall distractions, and the student is ready to go on to advanced concentration\nand meditation practice.\n\nkkk\n"}

But one advantage of the\nHong-Sau exercise over Kriya is this: that one may practice it after dinner or\nbefore dinner, in silence or among crowds; whereas Kriya Yoga should be prac-\nticed only when the stomach is empty or partially empty, and in privacy and si-\nlence. Hong-Sau may be practiced any time the mind is not engaged in outward ac-\ntivity and is therefore free to be interiorized. Therefore, one should practice\nit often, during leisure periods, as well as during one’s regular meditations.\n\nCultivation of Hong-Sau practice during leisure periods will augment the\ngood effects derived from Kriya Yoga practice. Indeed, practice of the Hong-\nSau Technique should never be forsaken, even after one receives the specific\nTechnique called Kriya Yoga. The purpose in practicing the Hong-Sau Technique\nis the same as in Kriya Yoga: to produce the divine ecstasy that deep practice\nof Kriya Yoga gives. The only difference between Hong-Sau and Kriya Yoga lies\nin the degree of speed with which the effects are derived. Twenty-four hours of\nprayer or meditation by any other technique (except Kriya Yoga) will not pro-\nduce as much spiritual advancement as one hour’s practice of Hong-Sau. Like-\nwise, it would take twenty-four hours of deep Hong-Sau practice to produce the\nsame spiritual result gained from one hour’s practice of Kriya Yoga.\n\nStudents should not erroneously think that they have nothing effective to\nwork with until they have Kriya Yoga. Just as it is necessary to pass through\nhigh school in order to enter college, so it is necessary to carry on the prac-\ntice of Hong-Sau in order to get the desired result from the higher practice of\nKriya Yoga.\n\nWhen a student passes from high school into college, he doesn’t forget\nwhat he learned in high school; he takes that knowledge with him and expands it\nin his college training. Similarly, the SRF student should by all means con-\ntinue with practice of the Hong-Sau Technique, and also the technique of listen-\ning to the Cosmic Sound (Aum, or Om) -- which will be given in a later Lesson --\nalong with the practice of Kriya Yoga, when he becomes eligible to receive it,\nif he wants to \"make the grade\" and attain realization of the Infinite.\n\nkkk\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nI exhale and stop the storm of breath, and the ripples of\nthought melt away.

Control of the life force helps the ego\nto switch off the electric energy from the nerve telephones, and thus prevent\nthe invasions of restlessness-creating, attention-enslaving sensations. To\ncontrol the life force in the five sense telephones is to practice concentration\nscientifically. When energy is switched off from the nerve telephones, sensa-\ntions are unable to snatch away the attention from its concentration upon a par-\nticular idea.\n\nThe vital essence of the body is formed of the most precious tissue and 7\nenergy of the body. Every drop of creative chemical fluid is said to contain ©\nthe concentrated essence of eight drops of blood and the electric energy that\nwould be contained in their thousands of blood corpuscles. Each cell of the\ncreative fluid is a condensed electric battery, containing a microscopic intelli-\ngence. To dislodge these mental and astral storage batteries from the body\nweakens the vitality of the body and the mind and makes the breath extremely\nrestless. Myriads of atoms of life and intelligence are lodged, like encamped\nsoldiers, in the creative chemical compound. To drive them out of the body\nfoolishly (lured by the enemy sexual temptation) is to lose these soldiers of\nenergy and mental power and to become a victim of the army of darkness, dis-\nease, weakness, fear, worry, dissatisfaction, melancholia, and even prema-\nture death.\n\nThe mind is the operator that controls the breath, the life force, the vital\npower, and all the functions of the body. Without its guiding power, all func-\ntions of the body would cease to operate. Mind-control leads to control of all\nthe functions of the body; but mind cannot control all of the functions of the body\nuntil itknows its own powers and the relative powers of breath, life force, and\nvitality in connection with itself. The person who tries to attain mind-control\nby harmonizing breath, life force, and vital essence, finds freedom more quick-\nly than the person who tries to attain mental control without the aid of controlled\nbreath, energy, and vitality.\n\n"}

The more\nyou practice Hong-Sau in your leisure hours, the greater will be the results.\nWork overtime and you will gain still better results.\n\nWhen you consciously watch the breath, what happens? The heart, the\nlungs and diaphragm gradually calm down and their muscles ultimately, during\na long deep silence, refrain from their otherwise constant motion. Thus the\nnormal processes of decay are stopped throughout the system; then no more\nvenous blood need be pumped by the heart into the lungs. When the heart does\nnot pump blood, the lungs do not have to expand to receive oxygen; then the\nbreath ceases to flow: you are temporarily living directly from Cosmic Ener-\ngy entering through the medulla oblongata.\n\nIt is always a good plan to drive out toxins before beginning Hong-Sau\npractice. By first practicing the inhalation and exhalation exercises (page 3),\nthe yogi burns out the carbon in the venous blood and decay is partially stopped.\nYou will notice that after deeply practicing this technique of inhalation and ex-\nhalation for a long time, when you throw the breath out you have no desire to\nbreathe in again for some time. You can remain longer in the breathless state\nthen than if you tried breathlessness immediately after restlessness.\n\nTHE ATTENTION Death is simply involuntary complete relaxation.

Finally, at the end of three hours, the\ndisturbing thoughts suddenly vanished from his mind; and in their stead he be-\nheld a beautiful vision of a saint standing lifelike before him.\n\nThis radiant saint not only appeared to be living but spoke with celestial\nsoftness: 1150171, in a former life you were a bad man, but before you died you\nresolved to be good.

Which of the two do you prefer?\"\n\nThe spiritual aspirant replied: ''I prefer to live in Hades with one wise\nman, for I know from my own experience that ten fools would make a Hades of\nheaven. Whereas, I believe that if I were with one real wise man, even in the\nstygian darkness of Hades, he would help me to make heaven of it.\"\n\nIf you have a peaceful, heavenly home but are constantly fighting with\nyour family and friends, you are living in a self-created Hades.

You can laugh at\nanyone who tells you that all breathing exercises are dangerous. Everyone is\nordained by Nature to perform one perpetual ''breathing exercise'' no matter\nwhether his lungs are good or bad. Violent breathing exercises are dangerous,\nof course; for they can cause trouble even to apparently strong lungs if there\nis any inherent weakness there. Cast out all fear when you practice the simple,\nextremely beneficial breathing exercises that Self-Realization Fellowship\nrecommends.\n\nWHEN YOU NEED TO If you are starving for oxygen because of improper\nBREATHE DEEPLY body posture, you need to breathe deeply and to\n\nbreathe properly. A person who sits with a bent\nspine and walks with a caved-in chest squeezes the diaphragm and lungs and\nprevents them from properly expanding and receiving the amount of oxygen\nnecessary to cleanse all the devitalized blood in the lungs. When the lungs and\ndiaphragm do not expand properly, not enough oxygen is brought to the blood.\nThus toxin-laden venous blood in the walls of the alveolar sacs of the lungs\nremains unpurified and is carried back into the system in this condition.

Use\nplanks on your bed instead of springs, and put a spring mattress on top. This\ninsures a straight yet soft bed, without endangering your health by bending\nyour spine as a too-soft and springy bed does.\n\nWHEN YOU DON'T NEED Eating is necessary if you are starved for food;\nTO BREATHE DEEPLY deep breathing is necessary if you are starved\nfor oxygen. But as continuous eating is unneces-\nsary when you have food in your system, so continuous breathing is unneces-\nsary if your blood contains a minimum of impurities, owing to right habits of\neating plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables and a minimum of starch. Many\npeople breathe hard because they have much waste material in their systems.\n\nCalm people breathe less, while restless types, who as a rule eat starch-\nes and meat to excess, tend to breathe like bellows. Their life force and\nmind are kept constantly busy with the physical functions of breathing and with\nthe heaviness and restlessness of the flesh.\n\nIf;you are calm there is less motion in your body. Asa result there will _\n\n6 less decay in your body and you will need to breathe very little; it is possi-\n\nble for an advanced yogi to remain without breath most of the time. If you\nbreathe rapidly, the heartbeat will be very fast. When you run you breathe\nrapidly and your heartbeat accelerates.\n\nDecay in the cells of muscles and some organs can be partially arrested\nby making the body motionless, but assimilative, circulatory, eliminative\nand other activities are still going on in the internal organs. Breathlessness\nand relaxation of the internal organs free the mind so that it can concentrate\nupon the soul. The higher you go in the study md practice of Self-Realization\nFellowship instructions, the more slowly you will breathe. Never forget this\ntruth: Breath is the cord that ties the soul to the flesh!\n\nDON'T HOLD THE Even though one's lungs may be perfectly healthy,\nBREATH TOO LONG it is extremely unwise to hold the breath in the lungs\n\nto the point of discomfort. When the oxygen supply\nis used up, the pent-up carbon dioxide seeks vainly to escape. Because the\noxygen supply has been exhausted, the incoming dark blood cannot be purified,\nand keeps on accumulating in the capillaries of the lungs, causing them to\nexpand until they are ready to burst. The result is a suffocating pain.\n\nTo hold the breath forcibly in weak or diseased lungs obviously would be\ninjurious. Persons with weak lungs should simply concentrate on breathing\n"}

They should be cured before attempt- ©\ning to breathe deeply. Deep breathing is not necessary for such persons until\n\ntheir lungs become strong. Everyone should learn to breathe correctly by\n\n` always keeping the spine straight.\n\nHowever, you cannot kill yourself by holding the breath too long in the\nlungs. Nature made the wise provision that when the venous blood strikes\nback toward the heart from the overfilled lungs, the heart palpitates and fret-\nfully shoots its life current back to the medulla oblongata. The medulla is\nshocked, producing unconsciousness. Then breathing automatically starts\nagain.\n\nYou can, however, injure the lungs and heart by foolishly holding the\nbreath. When dark venous blood has filled the lungs to capacity, it tries to\npush back through the pulmonary arteries into the heart. This may result in\npains in the heart or in leakage of valves, or in injury to the overexpanded\nlungs. Therefore you should never listen to anyone who tells you to hold your\nbreath in the lungs for a long time, or to practice violent breathing exercises.\n\nIMPORTANT POINTS CONCERNING THE HONG-SAU TECHNIQUE\n\n1. In doing the Hong-Sau exercise, do not force the breath in and out.\nBreathe naturally, merely watching, i.e., being aware of, the incoming\nand outgoing breath, mentally chanting \"Hong\" and ''Sau.'' Whether the\nbreath remains in the lungs or flows out, always wait until it flows\nnaturally again.\n\n2. Remember that the purpose of this practice is to lengthen naturally the\nintervals when the breath does not flow. If as you mentally chant \"Hong\"\nthe breath goes in naturally and does not flow out immediately, wait and\nenjoy the state of breathlessness. When the breath comes out again,\nmentally chant \"Sau.\" If the breath goes out and stays out, enjoy that\nstate of breathlessness until the breath wants to flow in again. Then\nchant \"'Hong'' as it does so.\n\n3. The breath should be expelled deliberately first, as a cue to begin prac-\ntice properly with an incoming breath and the mental chanting of ''Hong.\"\nIn ordinary breathing you are seldom aware of whether you are inhaling\nor exhaling the breath.\n\n4. Do not regulate the breath in order to chant ina definite rhythm. Let the\nmental chant follow the natural desire of the breath to flow in and out.\n\n5. Concentrate upon the intervals when the breath does not flow, without\nforcing this quiet breathless state.\n\n6. By watching the breath, you erase metaphysically the identification of the\n\n"}

By watching the breath, you separate\n\nyour ego from it and know that your body is sustained only partially by\nbreath.\n\n7. When you tense and relax the body and throw out the breath before Hong-\nSau practice, you halt motion and the resulting process of decay in the\ncells of. the muscles, but not in those of the internal organs--the heart,\nlungs, diaphragm, and so on. As you watch the breath during Hong-Sau\npractice, breathing becomes rhythmic and calm; the heart is quieted. A\nrestless and worried mind increases heart action; a quiet mind calms\nthe heart action. Any flare of feeling increases heart action. A heaving\nbreath also increases heart action, while quiet breathing calms the heart.\nBy watching the breath calmly, you cause both the breath and the mind to\nbecome calm. A calm mind and breath slow down and quiet the motion\nof the heart, diaphragm, and lungs.\n\nWhen, by relaxing and casting out the breath, motion is simultaneously\nstopped in the muscles and inner organs, the life energy that ordinarily is\nexpended in pumping blood through the heart--which means moving a total\nweight of eighteen tons every twenty-four hours--retires to the spine and is\ndistributed instead to the millions of body cells. This energy electrifies the\ncells and prevents their decay, making them like self-sustaining batteries.\nThe cells do not then require oxygen or food chemicals to sustain life, because\n\nthey do not need them to repair the damage of decay. And when decay is\n\narrested in the outer and inner organs the blood does not accumulate impuri-\nties; hence it does not need to be pumped back to the heart and into the lungs\nfor purification by the oxygen inhaled in the breath.\n\nWhen by watching the breath the yogi does away with outer and inner\nmotion (in the muscles and inner organs) and prevents the creation and\nincrease of venous blood in the system, he temporarily accomplishes two\nthings: ५\n\n1. decreases the necessity of living by breath;\n2. decreases the rate of heart action.\n\nWhen man can live more by the ''Word of God'' (Cosmic Energy) and less\nby \"bread\" or breath, and can control the heart, his body battery will be inter-\nnally charged with Cosmic Energy, and it w‘ll not need to depend so much upon\nthe outer sources of life (food, liquids, and gases).\n\nYou have now learned the following points about the value of practicing the\nHong-Sau Technique:\n\nIt enables the body cells to brim over with life force.\n\nIt stops decay in outer and inner organs.\n\nIt slows heart action, giving rest to this vital organ.\n\nIt calms the heart, which then switches off the energy in the five\n\nao ५9\n\n"}

Slowly exhale, counting 1 to 20.\n\n(Counting in this and other breathing exercises should be at a rate of\napproximately two counts per second. )\n\nRepeat the above exercise twelve times, three times a day in the open air,\nor more if you find it particularly beneficial. The count may be less than\ntwenty, or more, according to individual comfort and capacity.\n\nMEDITATION EXERCISE\n\nFeel that you are everything and beyond everything. Concentrate all your\nenergy at the point between the eyebrows. Breathe slowly. When the breath\nis calm, expel breath and forget it. Behold within your forehead the luminous\nlight. That light is spreading! It is increasing, swallowing up your body and\nall space. Space has become a burning ball of searless flame. You are that.\nThis ball of flame is very joyous.

Don't move amuscle. Try consciously to relax each\npart of the body; make a mental check every now and then throughout\nyour practice to be sure the body is really relaxed.\n\nBefore starting Hong-Sau, practice the following breathing exercises six\nto twelve times:\n\nInhale to a count of 20; hold the breath to a count of 20;\nexhale to a count of 20.\n\nIf 20 is too long a count for you, then inhale, hold, and exhale\nthe breath to a lesser count. Whatever the count, it should be\nthe same for inhalation, for holding the breath, and for exhala-\ntion.\n\nAfter practicing the breathing routine described in the preceding para-\ngraph, inhale, tense the entire body, throw the breath out (i.e., expel\nthe breath in. a double exhalation, \"huh, huh'') and relax. Repeat this\nexercise six times. It is a wonderful preparation for the practice of\nthe Hong-Sau Concentration Technique.\n\nOffer a prayer from your heart to God and the Gurus.\nKeep the mind calm. This is important for successful practice.\n\nWith the eyelids still closed (or half open), keep looking upward throughout\nthe practice of the technique. It is necessary to check yourself on this\nbecause the eyes have a tendency to lower their gaze after a time.\n\nThrow the breath out before beginning the concentration technique, so that\nyou can start with the incoming breath and the chant word \"Hong.\"\n\nIf you have difficulty in remembering to chant \"Hong\" with the incoming\nbreath and \"Sau\" with the outgoing breath, the following practice may\n‘be found helpful. Move the right index finger toward the palm of the\nhand when the breath flows in; when the breath flows out again, let the\nfinger resume its original relaxed position. The slight physical move-\nment of the finger has nothing to do with the technique itself; it serves\nmerely as a memory jog for keeping the correct sequence in chanting\n\"Hong\" and \"Sau. \"'\n\n"}

If you are nervous, it is difficult to bring\nabout healing of any disease you may have. If you are nervous, you cannot\nconcentrate and work efficiently to attain success. If you are nervous, you\ncannot meditate deeply to acquire peace and wisdom. In fact, nervousness\ninterferes with all the normal functions of the human body and mind, upset-\nting the physical, mental, and spiritual machinery.\n\nThe body may be compared to a factory in which many kinds of products\nare made by various machines that are run by electricity conducted through\nwires from a main dynamo. Inthe body-factory, the brain is the main dyna-\nmo that sends energy through a complicated system of special conductors, or\nnerves, to the different organs and members. These in turn act as machines\nto produce vision, touch, hearing, taste, smell, movement, metabolism,\ncirculation, breathing, and thought. When electric wires in a factory are\nburned out, they can be replaced by the electrician; but you have been given\nonly one nervous system to carry on the vital functions in the body-factory.\nIf the nerve-wires are burned out, you can do nothing to replace them. You\nare the manager of your own body-factory, and you must see to it that its\ndepartments work together in perfect harmony, and produce the highest class\nof products--physical, mental, and spiritual.\n\nSPECIAL CAUSES Nervousness may be caused by restlessness of the\nOF NERVOUSNESS mind, which sends extra energy vibrating along the\n\nnerves. Other causes of nervousness are great and\ncontinual excitement, whether it be excessive stimulation of the senses, as\nin pleasure seeking, drinking, wrong eating, overeating, faulty elimination,\noveractivity, or sexual indulgence; following the modern speed mania; or\nemotional overstimulation, such as long-continued fear, anger, melancholy,\nremorse, sorrow, hatred, discontent, or worry. Lack of any of the necessi-\nties for normal and happy living (such as proper exercise, fresh air, sun-\nshine, right food, agreeable work, and a purpose in life) aggravates, if it\ndoes not actually cause, a condition of nervousness. This condition is highly\ncontagious and may be \"'caught\"’ by association with nervous, faultfinding, or\notherwise disagreeable people.\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 183, "text": "S-1 P-24 3\n\n© The emotions that do most damage to the nerves are fear, worry, and\nanger. Constant fear affects the heart and may result in palpitation and other\nheart troubles. Worry and anger affect the brain as well as the rest of the\nbody, and lessen brain power and general efficiency. Fear and worry are\nvery closely connected. Worry is usually caused by a fear that something we\nconsider undesirable is going to happen, although the thing we fear practical-\nly never does happen. Volumes can and have been written on the subject of\nworry. All that will be said here is that a calm analysis of the cause will\nusually remove it.\n\nAny violent or continued mental or physical excitement causes a disturb-\nance of the balance in the flow of life force through the sensory-motor mech-\nanism (the sensory, or afferent, nerves and the motor, or efferent, nerves)\nand the bulbs of the senses. It is as if you put a current caused by 2000 volts\nthrough an ordinary 120 V incandescent = It would burn out the lamp. Sim-\nilarly, too great a stimulation upsets the functioning of the nervous system.\n\nThen, too, there are both physical and mental causes of disturbance in\nthe chemical balance of the body. The resulting discomfort sends a message\nthrough the nerves to the brain. Too much living on the physical plane saps\nthe life force and the vitality. Every time you become angry or afraid you\ngenerate the secretion of poison in the body. Its caustic effect may ultimate-\n\n@ _ly burn out the nerves.\n\nOVERCOMING Stage fright is another form of fear that causes nervous-\nSTAGE FRIGHT ness in many people, so that they are unable to act ina\n\nnatural manner before others. If you are shy and have\nstage fright, quiet your mind and remember that all the power you need is\nwithin you, all the power to convince people, all the power to give the direct\ntruth. The particular kind of truth that you want to give is in the Infinite\nSpirit, which functions through you.\n\nOvercome stage fright as follows:\n\n1. By getting used to talking to groups.\n\n2. By imagining whenever you give a talk that you are addressing\nan empty hall, or that you are talking to children or very\nsimple people.\n\nIf you really desire to help and serve people, to make them happy, to\ngive them some spiritual power that will electrify their souls, you have noth-\ning to fear. You will be able to do it. Why be afraid of people when you can\ngive enthusiasm, inspiration, and wisdom tothem? Let God flow through\nyou, and you will have all the power you need.\n\n© (The subject of stage fright is taken up in detail in Lesson 63.)\n\n"}

Death should\nbe looked upon as something good--a new opportunity, a rest from the weary\nstruggle on this earth. If you have made a mess of life, God sends relief in\nthe form of death, and gives youa freshtrial. Besides, there is nothing to\nfear, because so long as you are not dead, you are alive; and when you are\ndead, it is all over and there is nothing then to worry about. Death is a uni-\nversal experience, a change that everyone passes through. Live today well\nand the next step will take care of itself. Console yourself with the thought\nthat death comes to everybody--sinner or saint--and that therefore it must\nbe some sort of a holiday from the troublesome business of life.\n\nCHOOSE RIGHT Associate with strong, happy, serene, kind, and spiritual\nASSOCIATES people. This is of great benefit to the mentally or emo-\n\ntionally nervous person. Even a few moments in the\ncompany of a saint can work wonders in producing calmness and quiet. A\nreal holy man acts as a spiritual raft to carry you over the sea of trials and\nsuffering.\n\nDo not seek knowledge only through intellectuality, allowing the soul to\nremain in the darkness of spiritual ignorance. It is sad that many persons `\nwho know the way to peace and permanent happiness are slow to take advan-\ntage of their knowledge and follow it. They take the SRF Lessons and forget.\nMake use of your opportunity for spiritual development.\n\nCriticize and reform yourself. That is where your greatest problem lies.\nAffirm divine calmness and peace, and send out only thoughts of love and good\nwill if you want to live in peace and harmony. Live a godly life yourself and\neveryone who crosses your path will be helped just by being with you.\n\n3K\nTHOUGHTS TO LIVE BY .\n\nTo be controlled by moods is to be a part of matter. If you keep your\nmind on the resolve never to lose your peace, you can attain godliness. Keep\na secret chamber of silence within yourself, where you will not let moods,\ntrials, battles, or inharmony enter. Keep out all hatred, revengefulness,\nand desires. In this chamber of peace, God will visit you.\n\nThough you must remain in the world, be not of the world.

From the incense-vase of his heart fervent prayers\nfloated heavenward in spirals of deep sincerity. At the singular touch of\nthose fragrant soul-pourings, the All-Knowing Silence breathed joy. A cease-\nless exchange of unspoken invisible missives passed between the Great Omni-\nscience and this beloved devotee, whose every prayer was visibly granted by\nthe All-Satisfying Commander of all destinies.\n\nOne day, as the saint sat in the chamber of ecstasy communing with God,\nhe prayed: \"Beloved of all souls, grant me some mundane riches that I may\nfulfill my desire to build on this hillside a big temple in Your honor,\"\n\nThe Great One intimated to His devotee, through the tableau of a vision,\nthat he should see the king of his state. Emerging from the portals of silence,\nthe saint prepared himself for the journey to his vision-directed destination.\n\nAfter several hours of pleasant wandering through blossoming woodlands\nhe found himself walking the noisy, matter-vibrating streets of a city. When\nhe came to the palace of the king he inquired of the gatekeeper the whereabouts\nof His Majesty. ''The King is offering his prayers in the city mosque; you can\n__visit him there, '' came the reply from behind the barred gate.\n\nThe saint, after questioning many a passerby (and after quite a few de-\ntours!) at last found his way to the city's monumental mosque. He entered\nand knelt on an empty place on the alabaster floor near the king. Just as the\nsaint closed his eyes to pray the thought came to him: ''I am at last in the\npresence of the King, who is very rich and powerful. In all probability he has\nhad his every desire crowned with fulfillment. Iam sure he does not have to\nask for anything from anyone. Iam glad I have come for financial aid to one\nwho does not beg. \"!\n\nEven as the saint was thinking this, his attention was suddenly caught by\nthe whispered prayers coming from the royal lips. The devotee listened rapt-\nly, expecting a royal prayer from a royal being. But to his amazement he\nheard the following words: \"Heavenly Father, Possessor of all the glittering\nplanets, arcana, paradise, and earth, please grant me more riches and make\nme more powerful than all other kings. Give me more territory to annex to\n\nmy empire.\"\n\nStunned and disillusioned, the saint said to himself disgustedly, ''What a\njoke!'' He began to laugh uproariously, and with a scornful look at the king,\nhe cried out: 'Ha! Iam satisfied. I sought out a king, but I find only a beg-\n\ngar here. I must get away from this place.'' He started to walk away from\nthe mosque.\n\n"}

Cour-\ntiers and citizens protectively surrounded the angry monarch. However,\nseeing that threats were of no avail against the fearlessly laughing holy man,\nthe king composed himself and with folded hands knelt down before the saint\nand gently entreated him: ''Pray, will you satisfy my great curiosity as to\nthe cause of your laughter and strange antics during the services?''\n\nThe saint parried with a question: \"00 you make the same request in\nyour prayer every day?\" \"Why, yes,'' said the king. The saint laughingly\nbegan to explain: \"I came to you for some financial help to build a temple. \"'\nThe king interrupted. \"Of course! I will grant you that. But why did you\nlaugh at me in the service and then leave?\"\n\n\"Your Highness, 1 the saint replied, ''when I heard you pray for more\nopulence and territory, I saw that you are nothing more than a beggar--a king\nof beggars! Ido not choose to ask anything of the biggest beggar I have ever\nmet! No, thank you! Iam going back to my mountain cave and to my Beloved\nwho is waiting for me in the temple of ecstasy.

In order to be ideally happy\none must have good health, an efficient mind, a prosperous life, the right kind\nof work and, above all, an all-round, all-accomplishing wisdom.\n\nWithout inner happiness, one may be a prisoner of sorrows in a sumptuous\ncastle. Happiness is not dependent upon success and wealth alone; real happi-\nness depends upon struggling against the failures, difficulties, and problems\nof life with an acquired attitude of unshakable inner happiness. To be satisfied\nwith outward happiness, or material pleasures, defeats the search for bliss.\nTrue happiness comes by being inwardly happy first and at all times, while\nstruggling one's utmost to uproot the outer causes of unhappiness.\n\nSUPERIOR We can never be lastingly happy until we learn to seek satis-\nLASTING: faction in spiritual progress and to guard happiness from all\nHAPPINESS the influences that tend to destroy it.

Learn to be secretly happy within your heart\nin spite of all circumstances, and say to yourself:\n\n\"Happiness is the greatest divine birthright--the\nburied treasure of my soul. Having found it at last, I\nshall be secretly rich beyond the dreams of kings. \"'\n\nIf the soul becomes completely engrossed in lesser pleasures, it fails to\nbe attentive to the investigation of superior lasting happiness. Many persons\nreason that renunciation of material pleasures is almost an impossibility in\nthe business world. But the average man is not advised to hide away in the\njungle in order to find peace.

You are as old as your chronic\nthoughts, and you are as young as you feel now, in spite of your age.\n\nIgnorant people, like animals, disregard the lessons that accompany pain\nand pleasure, and thus live lives checkered with sadness and sorrow. They\ndo not avoid the actions that lead to suffering, and do not follow the paths that\nlead to happiness.

Nature is\nthe physical aspect, the body of God; while the life and conscious-\nness hidden in men, animals, and flowers, and all forms of matter\nare the soul or consciousness of God. Man has a soul, life energy,\nand a physical body; God as Cosmic Intelligence has cosmic life, and\nHis body is the cosmos.\n\nIf a person constantly looks at a wave, he becomes less and\nless aware of the sea. Likewise, when we concentrate upon and become\nattached to the little wave of our life, we lose sight of the Ocean\nof Spirit from which our life wave emanated. As variously situated\nelectric lamps may be lighted by power flowing from a single dynamo,\nso all the variously moving and existing human beings are actuated\nby the one cosmic dynamo of God's intelligent Light.\n\nkkk\n\nLESSON NO. 1 Every Self-Realizationist should say daily the\nprayer given at the beginning of this Lesson:\n\n\"Heavenly Father, Divine Mother, Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna,\nBabaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswarji, Guru-Preceptor Paramahansa\nYogananda, saints of all religions, I bow to you all. May Thy love\nshine forever on the sanctuary of my devotion, and may I be able to\nawaken Thy love in all hearts.”\n\nSelf-Realization Fellowship teaches the highest principle of\nspiritual living: meditation combined with activity. SRF students\nare taught how to dedicate inwardly to God all the day's activities;\nand, when work is done, to commune with Him in the temple of silence.\n\nGod must be earnestly sought. And when you are very desirous\nof finding Him, the Lord sends a guru. When you are in tune with a\ntrue guru you are in tune with God. The relationship is eternal.\nEven after death, a guru continues to help his disciples (i.e., those\nwho follow his teachings). This is a spiritual law.\n\n. Hence every SRF student should have deep regard for the link of\nSRF Gurus--Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna, Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri\nMahasaya, Sri Yukteswar, and Paramahansa Yogananda--with whom all SRF\nstudents are connected by affiliation with Self-Realization Fellow-\nship, founded by Paramahansa Yogananda.\n\nSRF teaches the student to practice control of the body until\nhe is its master. The human body has to be made ready to receive\nthe divine power. The state of consciousness has to be right; then\nGod will automatically come to you! But God may not respond right\naway. Only when He is convinced that you seek Him, not for the\nSatisfaction of temporal desires or for spiritual glamour and glory,\nbut simply to be His, unconditionally and forever, will He open the\n\ndoor. @\n\n"}

Thus you may know you too are a poten-\ntial child of God. Whatever your errors, they belong to the past;\n\nthey are not you. God is yours! The greatest sin is ignorance of\n\nour oneness with Him.\n\nSelf-Realization Fellowship offers you the universal tech-\nnique of salvation, the royal highway on which all theological by-\npaths conjoin. If you will study these Lessons and then practice\nthem daily you will soon realize a new goal of happiness, awakening,\nand Self-realization that will forever shed light upon you so that\nyou may live according to the highest standards of existence.\n\nSelf-Realization Fellowship teachings are a great dispensation\nsent forth into the world by Jesus Christ and Mahavatar Babaji to\nshow the unity of original Christianity and original Yoga, and to\nbring real God-communion to people in 211 lands. Self-Realization\n= the new dispensation that was promised in the Scriptures.\n\nLESSON NO. 2 Every day you should commune with God as the ever\nnew joy of meditation. Every day you should spread\nthe message of Self-Realization Fellowship by the example of your\nlife, and thus be a fisher of souls, in order to please God. De-\nvelop will power. Will and act until you achieve victory in every-\nthing worthwhile. Through will power you can energize the body.\nLearn to develop physiological, unthinking, blind will power into\n\n~the dynamic-divine will that Jesus referred to when he said: \"Thy\n\nwill be done.\"\n\nWill power should never be used wrongly; but the will should\nbe used, guided by wisdom. Will power was given to man for his\nuse. It is a metaphysical error not to try to use our will, for\nwe cannot help using our will in every movement and every act.\nOnly when we are physically dead or mentally dead do we not use\nwill power. When our own will is guided by true wisdom it becomes\none with the wisdom-inspired will of God. Our will and His will\nbecome one and the same thing. We should not isolate our will from\nGod, but realize that behind the little motor of our own will throbs\nthe Infinite Dynamo of God's endlessly powerful inexhaustible will.\n\nA wish might be called \"volition in embryo\" --helpless,\nunformed, lacking in power. It may remain as it is without fur-\nther manifestation and eventually dissolve for lack of energy. Or\nit may grow into desire and then determination. Even determination\nmay become discouraged. But when determination becomes volition,\nit becomes all-powerful. A volition consists of a series of continu-\nous, never-discouraged, unceasing determinations accompanied by ac-\ntivities revolving around a desire until it becomes dynamic enough\nto produce the much-craved-for result. You can utterly destroy\nthe roots of failure in your life by exercising your will until\nrealization comes that this dynamic will is already in your posses-~\nsion as the image of God within you.\n\n"}

They fail to use their discriminative\n\npowers to separate the kernel of truth from untested beliefs, and\n\nso they never feel the joyousness of actual realization of truth\n\nthrough the intuitive faculty of the Self.\n\nLed by curiosity and imitation, they enjoy listening to new\nideas from new personalities. They enjoy the thrill of change.\nThey become enamored of the \"path\" and forget the objective, al-\nthough impelled by a theoretical desire to live according to high\nprinciples.\n\nOne should avoid theoretical indigestion caused by swallowing\nnew ideas without assimilating them. Forsake the blind alleys of\ntheological beliefs. Give selective, practical attention to your\nchosen path and keep on practicing and finding results in the Self.\nThe best techniques of meditation are contained in the Lessons of\nSelf-Realization Fellowship. This is the direct, the airplane way,\nto God. Keep going!- One will know he has found the best way by a\ngrowing feeling of satisfaction; by an ever-increasing peace, wis-\ndom, and assurance from within; and by a continuously progressing\nintuitive perception, and an inner happiness of silence.\n\nLESSON NO. 4 Consider no one a stranger. First establish perfect\n\nfriendship with one or two souls, then offer that\ndivine friendship to all. Do not poison friendship by demand and\ncompulsion and wrong familiarity; or by discourtesy, or harsh speech,\nor mental cruelty. Practice friendship in your parental, filial,\nconjugal, or any other relationship, as the ¢ase may be. Bea true\nfriend.\n\nFriendship consists in becoming increasingly useful in every\nway (materially and spiritually) to your friends. Therefore, keep\nunceasingly developing if you want to be a good friend, or to in-\nspire friends, or to receive others as your friends.\n\nLove your enemies, for they too are your brothers. We are all\nchildren of one Father. See the image of God in all. Some people\nfrom the first meeting prove to be real friends always, while others\nthat we meet daily we never really know.\n\nBehold all races, your brother creatures, assembled beneath\nthe canopy of God's friendship. Let those who are our own come |\nunto us, until we know everyone is our own.\n\nLESSON NO. 5 Energize your body by recharging it from the inner\n\nSource. Although you must eat properly in the mortal\nstate, you should learn to rise above food-consciousness. When you\nmake up your mind not to be a slave to hunger, you find that your\nwill power can sustain your body by connecting it with the electro-\nprotonic energy that surrounds your body.\n\n"}

Bodily life depends\nupon food, oxygen, sunshine, and so forth only indirectly; but the\nsoul, having identified itself with the body, thinks that food is\nthe only source of life. When one learns to live more and more by\nwill power and energy, he realizes, as Jesus did, that man's body\nbattery does not depend upon bread alone (solids, gases, and sun-\nshine), but upon every word (vibrating energy) that proceedeth out\nof the mouth of God (medulla oblongata), through which the operator-\nwill draws vibrating energy (Word) into the body.\n\nThe actual proof that the body can be gradually sustained by\ncosmic energy is proven by the following: whenever you are tired,\nyou can replace some energy by drinking milk or eating food; but\nthe next time you are tired, instead of eating food, practice the\nRecharging Exercises gently for ten minutes. When you have perfected\nyour practice of the exercises you will find that your tired feeling\nwill leave you without your eating food This is an unfailing method\n\nकि of removing fatigue by ‘cosmic energy;~in place of food\n\n1.

Review by\nreading this Lesson once every week until you thoroughly know and understand\nthese principles and can successfully do the exercises. Every day upon waking,\nwhile still in bed, practice very slowly, with eyes closed, the exercises given\nin Lesson 8 under the subtitles of ''Relaxing Exercise\" and ''The Technique of\nEnergization. '' Practice these exercises also any time that you are tired.\nThe more you practice these exercises slowly and with concentration, the\nmore you will realize, by tension and relaxation of energy from the body, that\nyou are not just so many pounds of flesh, but rather the energy and conscious-\nness tied in the nerves, muscles, organs, and bones by the cords of attach-\nment. By realizing yourself as the energy in the body and not as the flesh,\nyou prepare the way for releasing your little caged life into the Infinite Life.\nThese exercises also awaken deeper consciousness and greater energy in all\nbody cells. A student of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons should not think\nof himself as a fleshly body, but as the light in the body bulb, ready to be\nswitched off or consciously released into the Infinite Light, or switched on\nagain in the limiting body bulb.\n\nSame. people know less than others, owing to wrong thinking somewhere, _ *-\nsometime in the near or distant past.

Practice the\nRecharging Exercises faithfully every morning and night as a regular part of\nyour spiritual routine.\n\nLESSON NO. 9 The student should maintain a balance between the Eastern\nmode of meditation and the characteristically Western habit\n\nof intense activity. Affirm often:\n\n\"I will be calmly active, actively calm. I am a prince of peace,\nsitting on the throne of poise, directing the kingdom of my activity. \"\n\nTo be too calm is to be lazy; to be too active is to become an automaton.\nMeditate or fall asleep when you feel overwhelmed with trials. Note the dif-\nferent forms of mental relaxation. Mental relaxation signifies mental rest.\n\nFree your mind from haunting worries by imitating the state of drowsi-\nness. Keep your breath calm, your character steady. With self-control at\n\nyour command, commune with God in meditation; and, whenever you seek\ncompany, be in the best spiritual company you can find.\n\n"}

Every night in sleep we are separated from all bodily habits; but\nthese limitations come back to us when we return from the subconscious state\nof sleep and again enter into wakeful consciousness. By complete, ecstatic com-\nmunion with God, all bodily attachments are destroyed. Then man, whether\nasleep or awake, consciously realizes his oneness with the Father.\n\nTENSION AND The greatest technique of physical relaxation is to tense the\nPHYSICAL whole body and then relax, exhaling the breath, casting away\nRELAXATION all restless thoughts. Remain as long as you can in this posi-\n\ntive calm state, without the interruption of restless thoughts,\nand remain without breathing as long as there is no strain. This is very, very\nimportant to remember: never hold the breath to the point of discomfort or\nstrain.\n\nIn the morning, while you are still in bed, practice the tension and relax-\nation of each of the twenty body parts;then after you are out of bed, practice\nagain.\n\nRead over the instructions and then thoroughly master the art of practic-\ning low, medium, and high tension. Remember that low tension signifies a\nlow charge of energy sent into a body part; medium and high tension signify\nthe influx of more energy into the -body part.\n\nIMPORTANT Remember that when a muscle or a body part is fully tensed,\n\nyou have charged that part with maximum energy. This sig-\nnifies that you should not tense any more, for the same reason that you should\nnot send 2000 volts of current into a 50-watt lamp. Just as a ship at sea can\nbe operated by radio without the help of any of the crew, so the ships of\nhuman minds and bodies are operated by God's cosmic energy shooting through\nthe cosmos and vibrating in the antenna of the medulla oblongata, or the\n\"mouth of God. ! The will receives the light of God through the medulla, and\nstores it up in the brain and six spinal plexuses.

In sleepland you partially realize your real nature:\nthat you are formless, that you are limitless as space, that you are happiness.\nThis recollection during sleep helps you to realize the forgotten image of God\nwithin you.\n\nIn a dream you can be a king, or a master, or an archangel; all the limi-\ntations of space and time and of human desires that infest earthly existence\nare removed. Some dreams have significance, being filmed by the supercon-\nscious, all~seeing mind, and then played upon the screen of your dream movie-\nhouse. Other dreams that are shown to you by your subconscious mind may\nbe meaningless pictures, merely a result of worried or restless activity.\n\nGod shows you by dreams that you can materialize your thoughts into\nEa feeling, and all earthly experiences, by the power of your subcon-\nscious mind. When you can materialize thoughts into dreams, you will real-\nize how God materialized His thoughts into the dream of earth and cosmos.\nEarth and cosmos are nothing but materialized dream-thoughts of God. By\nknowing this cosmos as God's dream, you can be free from birth and death,\nsorrow and pleasure, poverty and prosperity--for you will realize that all\nthese dualities are untrue, like dream experiences.

Simi-\n\nlarly, upon waking in cosmic consciousness, you will realize that you were .\n\nonly dreaming your existence as a human being.\n\nLESSON NO. ll Fostering the desire for luxuries is the surest way to lose\n\nmoney and cause unhappiness. Differentiate between your\nreal needs and unnecessary 'necessities.'' Happiness can be had by exercis-\ning self-control in everything.\n\nDesirelessness is not negative. It signifies that you should be able to\nforsake the troublemaking, short-lasting desires of bodily and earthly exis-\ntence for the superior, everlasting happiness of the soul. It is the vision of\nwisdom that directs you to seek soul happiness instead of sense happiness.\n\nWhat is God and how can we know Him? God is the ever-existing, ever-\nconscious, ever-increasing, ever-new joy of meditation. Because God is\never-increasing, ever-new joy, we should all the more seek Him rather than\ntemptation and sense happiness. God can be known and felt tangibly as the\never-increasing joy of deep and deeper meditation. Those who meditate only\na little while do not know the indescribable happiness that springs forth like a\ncataract from the cleft of really deep meditation. To know God you must med-\nitate intensely, as well as long; and regularly; and whenever you have spare\ntime. The incoming happiness you will feel will let you know beyond doubt\nthat it will consciously guide you in all things through your intuition. Of\ncourse it is better to meditate a little, even irregularly, than not to meditate\nat all--for by so doing you may gradually be encouraged to meditate more\n\n"}

Observe the perpetual current of\n\nemotions and thoughts that arise within you. Examine the\nheart of your aspirations, ideals, hopes, and despairs. Analyze the root of\nyour cravings. Life manifests itself through these channels, and so it is that\nthese fundamentals demand understanding, through intelligence, wisdom, and\nlove.\n\nFrom the emotions, the feeling in your heart, arise both thought and\naction. Quicker than thought is the action that springs from feeling. But the\nmind must view this as a spectator, and retain control.\n\n- Sorrow has no objective existence, no being of its own. It does not arise\nout of the conditions of life; it is not inherent in conditions. It is born of\nspiritual ignorance and the infirmities of the mind. Essentially, conditions\nare neither good nor bad; they are always neutral, seeming to be depressing\nor encouraging, according to the understanding attitude of mind of the individ-\nual.\n\nDuty is not imposed upon man by some superior power. It is the inherent\nurge of life toward progression; therefore, duty calls for attention and intelli-\ngent action. Every problem that waits for a solution at your hand is a solemn\nduty imposed upon you by life itself. Any escape from problems, physical or\nmental, is not an escape from life, but only delays your progress and is a\nsource of further discomfort and evil.\n\nAnger defeats its own purpose. It usually arises out of a feeling of inef-\nfectualness, inability to impose one's own will, or selfishness of one form or\nanother. It is a poison both physical and mental. Its method is that of fools,\nfor it is a destroyer of peace and harmony, and arouses wrath, resistance,\nand resentment in others. When you recognize anger coming over you, know\nit instantly for what it is--that is half the battle won. Control your speech,\nsaying nothing. Be alone for a few minutes if possible. Think of the offender\nas your brother who has acted in ignorance and whom in your heart you really\nlove. Protect your peace by calmness. Destroy anger by metaphysical rea-\nson, for ignorance is the mother of anger. It is also helpful to take a cold\n\nPARAMAHANSA YOGANANDA, Founder\nAll Rights Reserved (FOR MEMBER'S USE ONLY)\n\n"}

It can be imparted toan\nunborn baby through the subconsciousness of the mother. In the wakeful con-\nscious state, people learn and absorb the vibrations through the specific com-\npany they keep and through conscious will. Spiritually developed parents could\nbring about heaven on earth by bringing into the world only spiritual children.\nThat is a personal responsibility.\n\nLESSON NO. 13 Rules for acquiring prosperity:\n\nCut down luxuries.\n\nThink of yourself and, by meditation, know yourself as a child of God.\nThink of all nationalities as your brothers.\n\n„ Most important of all, seek prosperity for others and they will seek\nprosperity for you.\n\nभ WN\n\nDevelop the power of concentration by regular practice of the techniques\nwith great personal zeal. By concentration you learn to create at will what\nyou need. Develop one hundred per cent efficiency by practicing the art of\nconcentration. Your prosperity will be measured according to the degree and\npower of your concentration.\n\nRead carefully and practice the meditation entitled \"God's will and your\nwill.\" Pray after meditation, when the mind is under control, and pray un-\nceasingly until God responds to you through vision or through your deep intui-\ntion.\n\nIn only a very limited way can the conscious or subconscious mind create\na new cause of success in anything. But the superconscious mind has unlimi-\nted power to create success, as it is not governed by any limitation, but by\nthe boundless power of God.\n\nLESSON NO. 14 Humbleness is the valley of beauty where the waters of\n\ndivine wisdom gather to inundate the dry tracts of the\nhuman soul. Avoid an inferiority complex, for it means that you underesti-\nmate your powers; and avoid the attitude of superiority, for that means you\noverestimate your powers. Be natural; become great in humbleness and\nbecome great by effort and will power.\n\nEgotists refuse to investigate truth; humble men are always ready to\nlearn. Egotism shuts out higher knowledge and rebuffs the desire of the wise\nto help you for your own good; whereas by humbleness you will attract all\nkinds of wisdom to yourself. Besides, egotism only makes one appear big in\none's own eyes; and very much less in the eyes of others. Humbleness makes\n\n"}

To have personality requires a conviction\nof truth and the courage to utter it, but it does not mean the possession of\nrepulsive egotism. Egotism slaps wisdom in the face; humbleness entreats\nthe lotus feet of truth to enter the innermost sanctuary of the soul.\n\nGod, the knower of all things and possessor of all things, is not egotisti-\ncal. Hence, all those who want to be powerful like Him must be free of ego-\ntism.\n\nJesus said: \"He that is least among you 2.11, the same shall be great\"\n(Luke 9:48). You have also heard the proverb: ''An empty vessel makes a\nloud sound.'' The Hindu scriptures say: \"In shallow men the fish of little\nthoughts cause much commotion. In oceanic minds the whales of inspiration\nmake hardly a ruffle. ! One philosopher rightly said, \"A little knowledge is a\ndangerous thing.\" It often makes one inclined to egotistical display. The\nwise are so engrossed in their wisdom that they have no time for intermina-\nble \"revelations. \"\n\nSow hate and you will reap hate. Sow love in all hearts and you will reap\nlove everywhere. Every work is selfish. Even when we serve others, we do\nso to relieve ourselves of the pain that we feel when we see others suffer.\nResurrect your soul from the dream of frailties. To acknowledge defeat is\ngreater defeat. | . . . . . >>\n\nMeditation is the only portal through which you can escape from all your\ntroubles to infinite freedom. Meditation is the way to forget God's delusive\ndream of matter, and to remember and realize the forgotten image of God\nwithin you.\n\nLESSON NO. 15 Do not use your body, mind, or soul for perishable plea-\n\nsures, but use them for attaining the unending joys of\nSpirit. Repeat to yourself the prayer at the beginning of Lesson 15. Always\naffirm any prayer understandingly, with ever-increasing devotion at each\nrepetition. Your soul should approach nearer to God with each thoughtful rep-\netition of a prayer or affirmation.\n\nRemember, you often do not do what you wish to do, but what your habits\ncompel you todo. Good habits are automatic psychological machines, which\ndo not require the effort of will in performing specific actions; they help to\nmake easy the performance of these actions. Bad habits that compel you to\ndo evil should be destroyed.\n\nThough habits are compelling, yet you must remember that it is you who\ncreate them. If you can create bad habits, you can dislodge them by creating\ngood habits. A habit grows from the repetition of an inner thought or in\nresponse to some outward company. Therefore, if you want to break an evil\nhabit, change your bad company to good company, and substitute good thoughts\n\n"}

You can never break a bad habit if you keep feeding it by @ि\nbad company, wrong thoughts, and evil actions. Remember the temptation\nof bodily pleasures--never fed, they are ever satisfied, and ever fed, they\n\nare never satisfied.\n\nTHE POWER A specific type of company, or a specific thought repeatedly\nOF HABIT presented to the mind, influences the will, feeling, brain,\nand muscular mechanism of the body. Recordlike grooves\nare formed in the subconscious mind, which by memory and the medium of\nattention repeats the playing of the record of a mental habit. To yield to your\nbad habits is to make your enemies stronger. -To yield to good habits is to\nstrengthen your friendly forces, which help you to do good without effort.\n\nCultivate the spiritual habit of meditating with zeal, and you will reach\nGod easily.

Form the habit of eating properly; taking enough exercise;\nand planning healthy, wholesome undertakings.\n5. Form the habit of making practical, creative efforts that\nproduce the necessary prosperity.\n\nRemember the spiritual law of habit, and do not let material habits crowd\nout spiritual habits. Good habits must work in harmony, so that they cooper-\nate to work for your highest good. Never neglect the most important habit of\nmeditating for a less important habit of eating, or of doing something unim-\nportant.\n\nLESSON NO. 16 The following is a short definition that you should always\nremember:\n\nConcentration is the power to focus the mind on any desired line of\nthought.\nMeditation is concentration used only to know God.\n\nConcentrate and meditate early upon waking and before going to bed, or\nanytime you are free. Fill in the gaps of leisure hours with meditation.\n\nIf you can be quiet anywhere, meditate anywhere; but if noises disturb\nyou, try to select a quiet place, or wait for the silence of the night, for medi- @\n_tation.

Select a little room, or a screened-off corner with\nharmonious vibrations, for your meditations. Sit on a woolen blanket spread\nover an armless chair, facing the east, when meditating.\n\nMETHODS OF CONTROLLING THE SEX FORCE\n\n1. Keep the mind busy with good activities and meditation.\n\n2. Keep the vital fluid transmuted into muscular and brain energy.\nDon't waste it in bad company.\n\n3. Keep the breath calm by eating less carbon-producing foods, and\nby entirely abstaining from beef, veal, and pork products.\n\nIf the mind is calm, sex and breath will be under control. If character is\ngood, breath and mind will be calm. If you have breath control by the tech-\nnique we shall teach, then mind and sex will be under control. If you disturb\nany one of the three, you will disturb the others. Disturb sex control, and\nmind and breath will be restless.\n\nDo not sleep too much. Practice meditation long and with intensity. On\nSundays and holidays, meditate in the early morning from 6 to 9, and at night\nfrom 9 tol2. Regular meditation should be at least one half hour in the morn-\ning, one or two hours before going to bed, and meditate deeply whenever you\ncan in between. Do not be discouraged if it is not easy to meditate long in the\nbeginning. Just keep practicing, extending the time a little more each day,\nuntil you are able to sit long in meditation without even thinking of time.\n\nLESSON NO. 17 While in church, do not concentrate upon the social con-\nclave, noises around the church, or individuals making a\ndisturbance, but concentrate upon inner peace and on the sermon being\npreached. God talks to you through the voice of silence and peace in medita-\ntion, if you don't drown out His voice by the noise of your passions. With the\nwhip of intuition, drive away the money-changers of material desires and rest-\nlessness from the temple of meditation, which is the real house of God.\n\nWhatever your vocation may be--that of a businessman, a spiritual aspi-\nrant, a housekeeper, an artist--you can increase your efficiency one hundred\npercent by the regular, deep practice of meditation. Don't let anything inter-\nfere. This is what Jesus meant by: \"If thy hand offend thee, cut it off... If\nthine eye offend thee, pluck it out\" (Mark 9:43, 47).\n\nLife force in the nerves keeps the soul entangled with the messages of the\nsensations in eyes, ears, hands, and so forth. When life force is plucked.\nfrom the eyes and cut off from the hands and the consciousness of the body,\nthen its direction is reversed and it becomes focused on the omnipresent God.\nConcentration means freeing the attention from sensations, present thoughts\nand memory thoughts by consciously switching off the life force from the\n\n"}

This detachment of the mind from body consciousness is\nsimilar to that experienced in sleep, except that one remains consciously\naware.\n\nThousands of persons pray in churches and don't know why they do so, or\nwhy they don't get an answer to their prayers. If they knew the law of God-\ncontact, they would easily be able to commune with Him.\n\nLESSON NO. 18 Read again and again the explanation of concentration.\nWhen you try to concentrate upon one thing, you usually\nfind that soon you have forgotten all about it and are thinking about everything\nelse but the original object of your concentration. This is often experienced\nwhen you are thinking of a domestic problem at home or a business problem\nat the office, or a spiritual problem in the church. Forget the old method of\nconcentration by diversion, and learn the scientific method of concentration.\nRemove the causes of disturbances that affect your concentration and apply\nthe scientifically freed attention on anything you wish--material or divine.\n\nLESSON NO. 19 God reveals Himself to those who develop their inner\npowers and use the laws of concentration and meditation.\nBy using the law of thermal-control, heating systems have been invented. By\ncontrolling life force and the power of concentration, God can be discovered.\nBut remember, though God can be approached through law only, still He,\nbeing above law, cannot be compelled to reveal Himself to the true seeker by\nthe mere force of the law of concentration. Devotion or surrender of the Son-\nSoul to the Father-Spirit is necessary for the devotee demanding absolute sur-\nrender of God. God can escape the small nets of discrimination, pure activi-\nty, or concentration, but He cannot escape the net of devotion. When the\ndevotee completely gives himself to God, then God has to do likewise. God\nis very exacting when divine laws are concerned, but He is forgetful and\nbecomes intoxicated and relaxed when He is given the nectar-wine of devotion.\nGod loves to drink devotion from the secret winepres's of the devotee's heart.\n\nApproach God with the song of smiles. Silence signifies the silencing of\none's thoughts as well as one's tongue. That is really possible during sleep;\ntherefore it can be done during wakefulness also, by practice of higher\nmethods of concentration. There are threefold disturbances:\n\n(1) sensations;\n(2) thoughts aroused by sensations;\n(3) past memory thoughts roused by present thoughts.\n\nRead very carefully the pages in this Lesson about sensations.\n\nमद मंद He\n\n"}

Self-Realization Fellowship teaches you how to consciously switch\noff the.life force from the five nerve-wires of the senses. If you can do this\nby regularly practicing the technique, then no sensation-roused thoughts can\ndisturb your mind. If sensations stopped cropping up in the brain, thoughts\nwould not arise, andif thoughts stopped arising then memory-thoughts would\nnot be awakened. In sleep, as soon as sensations stop reaching the brain,\nthe conscious thoughts and the buried subconscious thoughts stop their activi-\n\n[ ; so by the conscious process of this technique, the same results can be\n\naccomplished. An attention free from disturbances is ready to be success-\nfully used in material or spiritual accomplishment.\n\nIt is not only the yogis of India (yoga means \"union\" and a yogi is a person\nwho scientifically tries to unite his soul with God) that have proved this. ForSt.\nPaul said: \"I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ (Consciousness)...\nI die daily (withdraw the life force from the heart, or die and live again at will).\"\n\nWhen the heart involuntarily stops beating, one dies; his life is switched\noff from the five sense-telephones of touch, smell, taste, sight, and hearing.\nIn sleep also, owing to the slowed-down action of the heart, a state of partial\n\"death\" or switching off of the energy from the nerve-telephones is accom-\nplished. Death is the permanent, unconscious, involuntary switching off of the\nlife force from the five sense-telephones. Sleep is a temporary, unconscious,\ninvoluntary switching off of the life force from the five sense-telephones by\nan unconscious method. Self-Realization Fellowship techniques offer a con-\nscious way of withdrawing life force partially (from the senses, muscles, and\nheart) or completely (from the entire body, as in death); and of then reinstall-\ning it in the senses, muscles, and heart, or into the entire \"lifeless\" body.\nIn sleep, life energy retires from the sensory-motor nerves and from the\nmuscles into the heart and. spine. In death, the life force and consciousness\nleave the body. But by the SRF technique of concentration, one can switch.\nlife force on or off at will from any part of the body or from the entire body.\nThe purpose of the technique is to quiet the heart so that the life force and\n\n"}

Calmness, calmness-producing food,\nand moderate activities are conducive to making the heart calm.\n\nCONCENTRATION BY When you practice the concentration lesson, sit\nQUIETING THE HEART calmly, suspending all bodily activities (from the\n\ndiaphragm, circulatory organs, lungs, and so\nforth) by practicing the Hong-Sau Technique of watching the breath.\n\nWhen motion is temporarily halted in the outer and inner body, the deteri-\noration of the cells stops and no venous blood accrues. When venous blood\nceases to accumulate, the heart slows down, for it no longer has to send the\ndark, impure venous blood into the lungs to be purified.\n\nWhen the heart is not given the work of pumping blood, the energy that\nordinarily is engaged in keeping the heart pumping slows down and begins to\nflow back toward the brain, instead of outward into the five sense-telephones.\nWhen this happens, the life force automatically withdraws itself, as in sleep,\nfrom the muscles and the five sense-telephones and retires toward the brain.\nThe life force is then switched off from the senses of sight, hearing, taste,\nsmell, and touch; sensations are unable to attract the attention of the brain.\n\nThus freed from disturbances of sensations and thoughts, the attention\nbecomes ready to be focused wholly on whatever material or spiritual object\nof thought one chooses.\n\nEvery night in sleep we unconsciously practice concentration by quieting\nthe heart. The yogi learns, in addition, to practice concentration by quieting\nthe heart consciously, as you have been taught in the technique of watching\nthe breath, the SRF Hong-Sau Technique of Concentration.\n\nDo not be frightened about quieting the heart, for by the conscious tech-\nnique one uses the calmness of meditation as a brake to slow down the heart.\nEntertain no fear when the heart slows down. To quiet the heart is natural.\nThe hearts of elderly people are quieted by nature after passing through peri-\nods of restless childhood and turbulent youth and active middle age.\n\nIt takes long practice to quiet the heart consciously. So long as one depends\non food to sustain the body, he cannot calm the heart permanently. Meditation\nis the conscious way of switching the life force in the body on or off. The Self-\nRealization Fellowship Hong-Sau Technique teaches concentration, not by diver-\nsion of the mind from the senses to God, but by withdrawal not only of the mind\nbut also of the life force, which is the medium of sense disturbances, from the @\nfive sense-telephones. Then the soul, being individualized Spirit, can manifest\n\n"}

If life force fails to digest\nfood and convert it into energy, then the body cannot live. When electricity\n18 missing from your automobile battery, adding more distilled water to it\nwill not help.

As often as the breath flows in, mentally chant ''Hong\" for the duration of\nthat inhalation. Whether inhalation comes quickly or slowly, and whether\nit is long or short, follow the foregoing procedure of chanting ''Hong\"'\nmentally, making no sound or movement of the tongue.\n\n7. If the breath \"stays in'' and there is no desire to exhale, wait, enjoying the\nfeeling of peace; as soon as the breath flows out, naturally, of its own\naccord, mentally chant ''Sau, '' making no sound or use of the lips or tongue.\n\n8. If the breath stays out, wait until there is desire for inhalation, enjoying\nmeanwhile the peace of the breathless state. When it flows in again, men-\ntally chant ''Hong'\"' for the duration of the in- flowing breath. And when the\nbreath goes out again, of its own accord, without force or act of will,\nmentally chant ''Sau'' until it is fully out.\n"}

By keeping his\nattention riveted to one thing at a time--the breath--the yogi is able to sepa-\nrate himself from the breath; then he realizes that he is neither the body nor\nthe breath, but the consciousness and intelligence in the body. He beholds\n\nhimself as a soul.\n\nTHE MEANING \"Hong\" is the vibration of the ingoing breath. ''Sau\" is the\nOF HONG-SAU vibration of the outgoing breath. Just as the word 'peace\"'\n\nproduces calmness in the mind and body, and as the word\n\"anger\" vibrates wrath, so the chanting of ''Hong\" and ''Sau'' calms the breath\nquickly, as that is its astral vibration.\n\nWHAT IS SLEEP? Sleep is unconscious sensory-motor relaxation, in which\n\nthe life force and consciousness are unconsciously\nswitched off from the lamp of the muscles and senses. To die daily, as mentioned\nin the Bible, is to switch the life energy in the bodily lamp off and on again\nconsciously and at will. The switched off energy in the yogi's body-lamp re-\ntires to the dynamo of Spirit, from whence he summons it again at will.\n\nBEST TIMES Meditate between 5 and 6 a.m.; 11 and 12 a.m.; 5 and 6 p.m;\n\nTO MEDITATE 10 and 12 p.m.; or between ll and 12 p.m. Naturally if one's\nschedule does not permit meditating at exactly these hours,\n\nselect the nearest time to these periods that is possible. Also, if one cannot @\n\nmeditate four times a day, then he should try to meditate twice in the morn-\n\ning, and once before going to bed at night, and during any leisure hours.\n\nLESSON NO. 22 Control of the vital essence is conducive to physical and\n\nmental well-being. To have good character and control\nover the sex urge is extremely important to one who seeks communion with\nthe Supreme Being. God created the divine ecstasy of meditation. Satanic\nignorance created pseudo substitutes for them--sex temptation and wine. Sex\nshould be used only for creative purposes; hence wine is the greatest tool of\nthe evil force, as it obliterates wisdom and discrimination and encourages\nthe misuse of sex. Wine and all drugs should be completely forsaken. You\nmust have moderation first and then renunciation if you are gripped by the sex\nhabit, or the dope or wine habit. ''When wealth is lost, little is lost; when\nhealth is lost, somethingis lost; when character is lost, all is lost.\"\n\nControl your mind. Don't do anything against the dictates of your con-\nscience and discrimination, just because you wish todo it. Learn to resist\nevil by will power. Do everything that it is your duty to do. Calm the breath\nand creative force by the power of your mind. Mind is the operator of all your\npowers.\n\nThe person who tries to concentrate by harmonizing breath, life force and\nvital essence gets quicker results than the person who meditates without disci-\nplining breath by technique, or without controlling character and sex life by\n\nstrong will power and reason.\n"}

It is very important to follow the instructions.\nRemember, whether the breath comes in slowly or quickly during a natural\ninhalation, mentally (without whisper or tremor of tongue, or sound from the\nlips) chant \"Hong\" for the duration of the inhalation. If the breath does not\ncome out, wait, and when it comes out of itself, quickly or slowly, mentally\nchant ''Sau'' as an accompaniment. If the breath does not go in at once, wait\nuntil it does go in of itself. Keep on repeating this.\n\nPOSITION OF EYES Try to practice the concentration technique with the\neyes half open, gently focused at the point between the\n\neyebrows. In the subconscious state of sleep the eyes are closed. During the\nwakeful or conscious state you keep your eyes open. In superconsciousness\n(consciously enjoying an ever-increasing joyous state, as in sleep) the eyes\nshould be half open, fixed at the point between the eyebrows. This is the cen-\nter of Christ Consciousness, and the eyes of sleeping children, and those of\ndying people usually turn up to it. Since meditation and concentration consist\nin switching the consciousness and nerve force toward God through the medul-\n\nकी re cbtongate {mouth of God )},-ene- should learn-to-concentrate the-eyes*at the -\npoint between the eyebrows (Christ-consciousness center), which is the\nreflection of the light of the medulla, during meditation.\n\nAs you like to close your eyes in order to be in the subconscious, or to\nopen them in order to be consciously working through the eyes, you will love\ninfinitely more to look up into the spiritual eye, situated at the point between\nthe eyebrows, when you get used to it. Practice without straining the eyes,\nbut practice you should, always concentrating at the point between the eye-\n\nbrows.\n\nLESSON NO. 23 Study the delicate art of breathing and breath-control. Our\npurpose is to teach proper breathing (as long as we have to\nbreathe some way!). Remember the following important points:\n\n(a) The purpose of watching the breath is to increase naturally the inter-\nvals when breath does not flow. Watchbreath in order to do away\n\nwith it.\n\n(b) Mentally chant ''Hong-Sau'' with the ingoing and outgoing breath as it\nnaturally flows, without using will power.

This will calm the heart and consequently increase longevity.\n\n(५) By watching breath, you learn how to separate your watching soul\nmetaphysically from body, breath, and the processes of conscious-\nness.\n\nLearn to live directly by Cosmic Energy coming through the medulla\noblongata, and not by breath only or food only. Prevent oxygen starvation by\npracticing the special breathing exercise given in this Lesson.\n\nLESSON NO. 24 #£xNervousness implies that one has been tampering with the\n\nnerve wires and the electricity of life which runs the entire\nbody factory. Hence you cannot afford to be nervous. Avoid the psychologi-\ncal and physical causes of nervousness described in this Lesson. Calm com-\npany, inner calmness achieved through meditation and eating plenty of fruit\nare the best antidotes for nervousness.\n\nLESSON NO. 25 _ Be inwardly happy always, retaining and remembering the\n\nhappiness born of meditation. This will make you outward-\nly happy too. Guard your happiness from the robbers of cranky, crabby,\nsorrow-loving, nervous people. Remember, no one can make you unhappy if\nyou refuse to allow him todo so. Happiness can be achieved by meditating\nlong and regularly, above all else, and by adopting those actions that generate\nhappiness. Ignorant people, like animals, do not quickly remove the causes\nthat make unhappiness. Avoid gossiping as you would avoid poison. Cultivate\nthe habit of discussing the good in people with those whom you love. Good\nthoughts attract the good in people. Evil thoughts attract evil.\n\nJudge not others, only yourself. It is easy to gossip about others, but\ntry gossiping about yourself fora. while and see how you like it. Whenever you\nfeel like talking about others, try talking loudly about your own secret weak-\nnesses and faults before your enemies and friends. You won't like this. Cor-\nrect yourself first. Make your home a valley of smiles, blossoming with\nhappiness. The breeze of your constant divine smile can keep the lives of\nthose you love throbbing with joy and filled with blessings.\n\n(1\n\n"}

O Father, from joy Icome; for joy I live; in joy dost Thou melt me!\n\nHOW TO CONTACT GOD THROUGH MEDITATION--Part 1\n\nDEFINITION Meditation is that specific form of concentration which is\n\napplied only in connection with consciously tuning in with Cos-\nmic Consciousness--the home of cosmic supply. ` By this method, the proficient\nstudent can not only finally attain everything that the power of attention can and\nshould accomplish, but can also develop the power to control his destiny, and\nprevent failure and disease. This method teaches one how to reinforce, revital-\nize, and strengthen the human faculty with the faculty of superconsciousness,\nthrough faithful, persevering practice.\n\nMeditation is the pickax that pries up all the covers of consciousness, and\nbrings forth the fountain of God's ever new joy. Meditation--complete relaxation\nor conscious withdrawal of the mind from the restless senses--is the only way to\nknow God. Even though you may be able to do everything else but meditate, you\nwill never find joy to equal that which comes when the thoughts are silent and\nyour mind is tuned to the peace of God. If you ask, ''How do I know there is such\njoy as you describe?'' this is my testimony: if you practice meditation every day,\ndeeply and consistently, you will find that ever existing, ever conscious, ever new\njoy, ever increasingly manifest within you. And with practice it will stay with you\nin activity and in silence alike--even in sleep. It is a joy that will constantly\nguide you to right action in everything and will respond to your prayers. You have\nto demonstrate that for yourself. And this is my further testimony: that, once\nGod's joy has been found, all desires for other gain will dwindle in comparison.\nYour consciousness will expand. You will be able to stand unshaken amidst jar-\nring trials. The whole world will not be able to lure you to forsake the bliss\nthat you will find in meditation. You will enjoy all other things in that divine joy.\nBecause Jesus had experienced this he could say: ''Get thee behind me, Satan!\"\nThe satanic temptation of material desires fell dead before his joy in God.\n\nMEDITATE BY THE Completeness in God is by no means negation of ordinary\nRIGHT METHOD life and its responsibilities and joys; finding God is posi-\n\ntive attainment that elevates and beautifies all life.\nHuman existence, however pleasant, is only a bubble of laughter; in God it\nbecomes the sea of mirth. ''Thou, O God, art the ocean, and I, a tiny bubble of\nlaughter, have become the sea of mirth!\"\n\nYou can find this joyous perception of the Divine only by the right method a\nconcentration and meditation. If you are looking at the ceiling of your room for\nthe door, you could seek for years and years but you would never find it until\nyou adopted the right method and looked for it in the wall.\n\nWhen your desire for God is sincere, He sends a right vehicle: a spiritual\n\n"}

When Jesus\nsaid, ‘No man cometh unto the Father but by Me, '' he was speaking of the Christ\nConsciousness within. The joy that comes in meditation is proof of the existence\nof that ever newly joyous God. Since I learned this, ofttimes when sleep steals\nover me, I say: ''Go away from me, you gross intoxicant! Ido not want to lose\nthis joy in your unconsciousness. '!\n\nYour whole body changes when you practice meditation frequently, because\nwhen you really contact God, all things become harmonious; all things melt into\nan ocean of peace. But you have to practice meditation earnestly, consistently,\nand continually, in order to have the full consciousness of that supreme force.\n\nFORM THE HABIT Your engagement with business is important; but your\n\nOF MEDITATING appointment to serve others is more important; and your\nengagement with meditation, home, God, and truth is\n\nmost important. Don't say that you are too busy with worry, and the care of\n\nkeeping the wolf from the door, to find time for the culture of heavenly qualities.\n\nBreak your self-satisfied, doggedly immovable, old bad habits of idolizing\nyour less important engagements and utterly ignoring the most important engage-\nment: your engagement with meditation and God. No one else will answer for\nyour actions, although others often become instruments in keeping you enmeshed\nin useless frivolities and so-called important engagements.\n\nO sleeping image of God, wake up! Make the determination and the effort\nto know the right law which will enable you to keep your most important engage-\nment with yourself--to know yourself, your own Soul.\n\nDo not say: \"I will meditate on the Cosmic Being tomorrow. '' That tomor-\nrow may never come. Begin your meditation today. Today's practice will stim-\nulate the desire to meditate deeper tomorrow, whereas this day's negligence\nwill weaken your craving. Meditate today deeper than you did yesterday, and\ntomorrow meditate deeper than you do today. Meditate during most of your lei-\nsure hours. Instead of being absentminded, think of God. Seek God as the ever\nincreasing bliss of meditation; and feel Him as boundless joy throbbing in your\nheart. Do not be lured by bad habits and paltry, useless vanity-engagements\ninto crowding out God-contact. Seek to know God first, last, and all the time.\nFinding Him first, you will find all things that you crave through Him.\n\nPRACTICE LONG AND It is good to start meditation at an early age, or,\nDEEP MEDITATION failing in that, to start meditation as soon as the\nmental discriminative inclination is receptive. It\nis very difficult for the occult soldiers of the mind to reclaim the kingdom of\npeace after it has fallen into the hands of restlessness and material desire.\nTherefore, make spiritual hay while the sun of willingness to meditate shines.\n\nThe longer and deeper you meditate and affirm, the deeper will you feel\n\n"}

Then you will know | ।\nwithout doubt that there is a God and that He is ever existing, ever conscious,\nomnipresent, ever new joy. Then you may demand: ''Father, now, today, all\n\ndays, all tomorrows, every instant, in sleep, in wakefulness, in life, in death,\n\nin this world, and in the beyond, remain with me as the consciously responding\n\njoy of my heart. ''\n\nDo not jump up after only one or two mental broadcasts, but with continuous\npersonal zeal keep on consciously with the ever increasing hunger of your heart,\nincessantly, mentally uttering the foregoing affirmation for regaining and hold-\ning on to the lost unity with God, until you feel the ever increasing thrill of joy\nbursting in your whole body. This increasing joy after meditation is the only\nproof that God has answered through the devotion-tuned radio of your heart.\n\nDuring deep meditation, when the breath becomes calm, a very enjoyable\nstate of peace is produced; but owing to the strong ego-consciousness, the\nthought of the body returns, and the fickle loud breath revives, rousing material\ndesires and sense distractions. The devotee should not be discouraged at this\nbut should by deeper meditation learn to calm the breath and the senses fora\nlonger period.\n\nWhen King Material Desire does not get support from past bad habits, the\nego comes to cheer and strengthen him. Those who equally enjoy sense plea-\nsures and pleasures of meditation will not get anywhere for a long time. It\nshould be remembered that even if one cannot conquer the flesh, he must medi-\ntate just the same, for then there will be a sense of comparison between the\nlesser pleasures of the senses and the greater pleasures of the soul. Those who\nfail to conquer the senses and who give up meditation too, become almost hope-\nless cases of spiritual decay.\n\nIf after deep meditation the devotee is thrown into a state of restlessness\nowing to the memory of sense joys, he feels greater inner discomfort and\nbewilderment as he suddenly finds that he feels neither inner joy nor the passing\npleasure of the senses. At such times he is tempted to declare: ''O Great Soul,\nI wish neither inner happiness born of self-control and spiritual adeptship, nor\nthe pleasure of the senses.'' This mental state should be overcome, and can be\novercome, by regular, deep meditation and by picturing the ever new blessed\nbliss felt in the deep caves of contemplation.\n\nHOW TO ENTER The scientific method of entering real silence was taught\nREAL SILENCE in the Lesson on concentration. And inthis series of\nthree Lessons on meditation is taught what to do after attain-\ning silence, and how to use the freed attention to direct it toward God. In real\nsilence both your muscles and your thoughts are quiet. You can silence the body\neasily, but it is difficult to silence your thoughts. They still run wild, jumping\nfrom one thing to another with miraculous speed. But by using scientific meth- e@\nods, you can effectively silence the thoughts too. As long as there is motion in\na pond of water, so long will you be unable to see the clear reflection of the\n"}

Remember, as long as a restless thought or a bodily motion\nremains, you cannot hear the Inner Voice, or see with the Inner Eye. In other\nwords, God will not enter your temple. In an inwardly and outwardly quiet body\ntemple, illuminated by devotion, love, and inspiration, God may be coaxed to\ncome, which means that real vision and real intuition will be awakened.\n\nBE FREE FROM Meditation is the real panacea through which you can per-\nTHE DELUSION manently cure yourself of the daydream of matter and all\nOF MATTER its evils, and realize yourself as pure Spirit. Until you\n\nhave built the temple of silence within yourself, until you\nhave broken down the ramparts of habits with which environment has surrounded\nyou, you will never see the glory of God; you will never have real peace and\nlasting joy. When you meet the Great One, darkness will pass away forever.\nThe power of truth is here in these teachings, and if you will but make a deter-\nmined effort, you will no longer walk nervously in fear and uncertainty on the\npathway of life. (To be continued)\n\nTHOUGHTS TO LIVE BY\n\nWhat is meditation? It is becoming one with the soul; it is dropping your\nrelation with the muscles and with human limitations and remembering that you\nare a soul. When you begin to relate yourself to the soul, then you will be aware\n\n@ of more of your past experiences, and you will know that you have come down\nfrom the bosom of God. |\n\nIn God lie all the memory and experiences of your life. In your inner con-\ntact the forgotten times and powers will come back into your consciousness.\nMeditation leads you to remember that you are not a mortal, but that you are one\nwith God. During the daytime, when you are not meditating, you remember that\nyou are a mortal, but in meditation the reverse is true. Meditation means drop-\nping the consciousness of the body, remembering who you are, and then coming\n\nback and ruling the body.\nमै कैप कै:\n\nTHE BAD MAN WHO WAS PREFERRED BY GOD--Part 1\n\nThe loving Lord of the Universe has always visited ardent devotees. Some-\ntimes before doing so He sends messengers to find out those devotees who are\nworthy of darshan (a vision or sight of the Lord). In India they tell a story about\nthe time God sent Narada back to earth. In the West, Narada might be described\nas an archangel. He was a glorious being, freed from birth and death, and ever\ncloseto the Lord. During a former incarnation on earth he had been a great\ndevotee of God, and so it seemed that he should be easily able to discover others\nwho were pursuing the Lord with will and ardor.\n\n@ Narada the archangel now came to earth incognito, garbed as an ascetic. In\nmountains and valleys and jungles all over India he sought out the hermits and\nrenunciants whose thoughts were centered on God and who performed all actions\n\n"}

While ambling through a dark woodland one day, he spied a hoary\nanchorite practicing different kinds of postures and undergoing penances under\nthe cool shade of a huge umbrella-like tamarind tree. As if he were merely a\nleisurely wanderer, Narada approached and greeted the ascetic, inquiring curi-\nously, ''Who are you, and what are you doing?\"\n\n\"My name 15 Bhadraka,'' the hermit replied. 'Iam an old anchorite. I\nhave been practicing rigorous physical discipline for eighty years. '' He added\ndisconsolately, ''Without achieving any marked results. '' Narada then intro-\nduced himself: ।\" am a special messenger sent by the Lord of the Universe to\n\nseek out His true devotees. \"'\n\nRealizing that at last his opportunity had come, the anchorite pompously\nassured Narada of his worthiness to be honored by the Lord. ''Esteemed Emis-\nsary,'' he said, ''surely your eyes are now beholding the greatest devotee of the\nLord on this earth. Think of it, for eighty years, rain or shine I have practiced\nevery imaginable technique of torturous mental and physical self-discipline to\nattain knowledge, and to find merit in the Lord's eyes. \"'\n\nNarada was impressed, ''Even though I am from those higher planes where\ngreater accomplishments are possible, Iam very much touched by your persis-\ntence, ''he assured the old man. Bhadraka had been brooding on his grievances\nwhile talking to Narada, and instead of being comforted by Narada's words, he\nspoke angrily. ''Well then, since you are so close to the Lord, please find out\nwhy He has kept away from me for so long. When next you meet Him, do ask why\nHe has not responded to my disciplinary exercises. Will you promise me that?\"\n\nNarada agreed to the old man's request, and then resumed his search for\nearnest devotees of God. In one place he paused to watch a most amusing incident\ntaking place at the roadside. A very handsome and determined young man was\ntrying to build a fence. Unfortunately he was dead drunk, and his senses kept\ndeceiving him. He had dug a series of holes for fence posts, and was trying in\nvain to fit an unwieldy bamboo pole into one of these elusive holes. He would\nthump the pole on the ground all around, but he could not get it inthe hole. Sev-\neral times he stumbled forward and almost tripped himself.

Blindly groping, the urge of my devo\ntion suddenly flings open the soul's secret door, and oh, what\nbliss I feel at the sight of Thy Light!\n\nKKK\n\n"}

As soon as the breath is quiet, your plane of consciousness is\nlifted. Meditation is the only way to keep yourself filled with the power of\nSpirit. Words without soul-force are like guns without ammunition; there-\nfore while meditating do not think merely of words, but of their meaning, and\nwith intensity mentally offer the thought behind them to God. On the throne\nof silent thoughts, the God of Peace will direct your actions.\n\nOpen the door of your calmness and let the footsteps of silence gently\nenter the temple of all your activities. Perform all duties serenely, saturat-\ned with peace. Behind the throb of your heart, you shall feel the throb of\nGod's peace. Fill your heart with the peace of meditation.\n\nLearn how to plunge into introspection about every experience, whether\nit concerns good books, problems, religions, philosophy, or inner happiness.\nRetire within the cell of your deep thoughts, and enjoy the peace oozing out of\nthe fountain of silence.\n\nCONTROLLING THE During real meditation, all of the five sense tele-\nSENSE TELEPHONES phones must be shut off. Silence is what the whole\n\nworld needs, particularly those who are on the\npath of meditation and are striving to progress toward greater spirituality.\nAny attempt at silence is better than the ineffective prayer that is commonly\npracticed; because in such prayer, while the movements of the body may be\nstilled, the thoughts go on with their dance of restlessness.\n\nAs a result of closing the eyes in meditation, the sensations of sight are\nprevented from reaching the brain; and by sitting in a quiet place one can keep\nthe extremely busy auditory phone quiet as there are no sounds to reach the\nbrain. If, then, the two most important sense telephones of sight and hearing\nare disconnected in meditation, the other telephones of smell, taste, and\ntouch become disconnected also, because the operator is then relaxed, and\nfree from constant attention to the reports of the two busiest telephones--\noptical and auditory--in the body house.\n\nYOUR SOUL'S Just as from a seed planted in proper soil there springs\nOMNIPRESENT forth a tree, so from proper meditation instilled in the\nNATURE soul the consciousness of Omnipresence will manifest.\n\n"}

God is omnipresent. The cosmos\n\nis His body. Man's soul, made in His image, has in it the seed experience of\nomnipresence, This consciousness of omnipresence is hidden in the soul, as\na tree is secreted in a seed,\n\nLooking at the body constantly causes the mind to think of itself as con -\nfined in the flesh. As meditation upon the Infinite grows deeper, it makes the\nmeditator, meditation, and the object of meditation one. Then the mind be-\ncomes convinced that it is not encased in the body, but that it is in everything\nin the body of the cosmos. The mind thinking constantly about the body be-\ncomes limited by it. The mind meditating upon the Infinite becomes unlimited.\nMeditation is the art of transferring the attention from finite things — the lit-\ntle bodv and the portions of space in which mortals live ~~ to the Infinite.\n\nMen and women aspiring to expand their consciousness into the all-per-\nvading God-consciousness should learn to meditate upon the cosmos. Medi-\ntation means constant thinking of the vastness within and without, so that the\nsoul may forget its attachment to the limited physical body and remember its\nvast body as God. The ocean is the wave, the wave is the ocean; the ocean\nmust know that it is the wave and the wave must know that it is the ocean,\nThe Spirit Ocean knows that it has become the soul waves; but the soul waves\nneed to recall, by meditation, that they are the Spirit Ocean. The little soul\n\n“wave must forget its smallness, which is only a mental concept born of con- ~\n\ncentration upon the body, and must concentrate upon the universe as its own\nbig body, of which the physical body is just a tiny part.\n\nA mundane personality is busy with looking after the body and its cramped\nrelations with a few other human beings. Such a person's consciousness does\nnot extend beyond the gates of its own home, The spiritual man, through the\nspreading light of sympathy and meditation, learns to feel the woes and pains\nof others. He feels that the world. or cosmos, is his home. This is why the\nmeditating aspirant must do away with little body attachments. He must learn\nto be proof against too warm or too cold climates. He must learn to overcome\nhunger and pain. He must learn to conquer all the appetites and attachments\nthat govern the little body, for as long as the mind is focused on the body and\nits relations, the soul cannot remember its omnipresent nature,\n\nHOW TO ATTAIN COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS\nThere are three ways of attaining Cosmic Consciousness:\n1) The social way\n\n2) The way of discipline\n3) The spiritual way\n\nSOCIAL WAY The social way consists in expanding the germ of divine love\nwithin the soul. Too much love of self confines the soul\n"}

The soul is an omnipresent reflection of\nthe all-pervading Spirit. The ego is the body-bound consciousness of the soul. @\nThe soul, as ego, forgets its etheric omnipresence and considers itself limit-\n\ned to the body.\n\nEvery human ego can imagine itself spread out in space, but can feel it-\nself only as the body. It is when the ego begins to feel itself in other bodies,\nthrough practical sympathy, that it begins to regain its forgotten omnipres-\nence. Unlike the shortsighted worldly man, the divine man works not only for\nhimself as one body, but also for his greater Self, which he beholds embodied\nin all others. Similarly, you should not only feel hungry, desire to be pros-\nperous, wish to be healed, or long for wisdom for yourself in one body; you\nshould learn to feel for yourself in all bodies, in all minds, in all lives, in\nall souls.\n\nHence, the social way of developing cosmic consciousness is to love\nyour family, neighbors, country, the whole world as yourself. Include the\nworld in your love, and call yourself a cosmic citizen. You are the king; and\nin the kingdom of your love, include not only all human beings --but also ani-\nmals, flowers, the flocks of stars pasturing on the long savannahs of the blue\n` --all living creatures. Love all men as your brothers; love all women as\nyour sisters; love all elderly men and women as your parents; and love all\nhuman beings --the black, white, brown, yellow, red,and olive-colored races\n--as your friends and brothers. This is the social way of attaining cosmic\nconsciousness.\n\nWAY OF DISCIPLINE By mental and physical discipline rise above the\n\nconsciousness of caste, color, dogmatic creed,\nfamily, race, nationality, and poverty. Make it a rule to be pleasant and to\nexercise self-control. Be kind, abstemious, and moderate. Do things that\ngive you lasting happiness. Speak no untruth. Abhor stealing, overindul-\ngence, worry, fear, anger, greed, jealousy, and restlessness. Learn to\nwithstand heat and cold, and to endure happiness without mental excitement.\nRise above sensations even though you are still subject to them.\n\nMeditate, by withdrawing your attention from objects of sense and from\nmuscles, lungs, breath, and heart, and concentrating that freed attention up-\non the spine. Then go out through the medulla oblongata into infinite space.\n\nSPIRITUAL WAY The inner way of developing cosmic consciousness lies\n\nin practicing the art of living on the sense plane with-\nout making sense contacts: that is, the art of controlling the senses--opera-\nting them or switching them off at will in the various sense organs.\n\n1. Learn to switch the consciousness and life: current on and off from\nthe heart, breath, and lungs.\n2. Put life force in all the muscles and then relax.\n\n"}

Come here now and\nhelp me to fix my pole in this hole, or I'll thrust the bamboo right through\nYour hard heart.\"\n\nJust then the young man's wandering gaze fastened on Narada, standing\nshocked and agape at the drunken one's temerity.

It is necessary to achieve attunement with Spirit or\nDivine Consciousness before one can realize Divine Consciousness. In medi-\ntation you learn to contact Spirit, or the Creator, in reality. Words cannot\nconvey to you the wonderful realizations and intuitions that the technique of\nmeditation presented in this Lesson will bring you; it would be impossible\neven to name them all here. If you practice regularly, faithfully, and rever-\nently, you will get them all finally. You will be able to hear the vibrations of\nthe astral centers of consciousness and life in the spine, and in time you will\nbe intuitionally in tune with the Cosmic Vibration. Continued right practice\nof this technique will give you an unparalleled command over your mind, en-\nabling you to focus it in the most intense way on any object of thought--intel-\nlectual, physical, or spiritual. This is as true as the statement that the sun\nrises inthe east. The technique will also help you tremendously to increase\nyour power for the accomplishment of great work in life. Above all, it will\nenable you to contact the superconsciousness of the soul and through that the\ncosmic consciousness of Spirit, giving you the wonderful peace, harmony,\nand poise of mind inherent in the higher life. It helps to soothe and rest the\nnerves and to bring about the most desirable bodily conditions.\n\nPray to the Great Spirit with a reverent, loving attitude: ''O Great Spirit,\nhelp me to gather my inner powers and realize Thee through ThyCosmic Vi-\nbration. The universe is projected from Thee through vibration. It is sus-\ntained by Thee through vibration. Vibrations pervade everywhere. Thou art\ntranscendentally omnipresent with the Cosmic Vibration.

This projected creative power of God is the God that can be\nknown through contacting Om.\n\n"}

St. John makes\nreference here to the third eye in the forehead, with its divine light.\n\n\"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock (sound through Om vibration): if\nany man hear my voice (listen to Om), and open the door, I will come in to\nhim\" (Revelation 3:20). Patanjali (a great Hindu Raja Yogi) wrote: ''Medi-\ntate on Om to actually contact Iswara (God). Om is His symbol (manifesta-\ntion of creation). 11\n\n\"I was in the Spirit (spiritual consciousness)on the Lord's day (the day of\ncontacting the divine realms of truth), and heard behind me (in the medulla\noblongata, 'behind' or in the back of the head) a great voice, as of a trumpet\n(the great blissful sound of Om)\" (Revelation 1:10).\n\n\"These things saith the Amen (Om), the faithful and true witness, the be-\nginning of the creation of God'' (Revelation 3:14). St. John here speaks of the\nCosmic Om sound as the faithful witness or proof of the running of the Cosmic\nMotor, the force which projected creation, and the vibration of its sound as it\nupholds creation.\n\n\"And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as\nthe voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with\ntheir harps\" (Revelation 14:2). These different sounds are vibratory varia-\ntions of the one Cosmic Sound. Each has its own particular rate of vibration\n(and hence its own particular sound) which is required to create a particular\nelement in the cosmos.\n\nTo love or to meditate upon God, one must definitely know Him. By\nright practice of this Lesson He can be known, manifesting as intelligent,\never-conscious, ever-new, joyous Cosmic Vibratory Sound, or Om, rever-\nberating all over the universe. By properly listening to and feeling this Cos-\nmic Sound, one's human consciousness gradually becomes enlarged, its terri-\ntory extended beyond the body to include the universe.\n\nSCIENTIFIC TECHNIQUE OF MEDITATION\n\nHAVE YOU A The following Om Technique of Meditation--and every other\nSPIRITUAL meditation technique that is given in these Lessons--should\nTEMPLE be practiced in your spiritual temple, the room or corner\n\nof a room that you have set aside for meditation and spiri-\ntual study. If by chance you have not yet established such a place, make ita\npoint to do so now. Every location reflects the vibrations of the occupation\nfor which it is used; therefore you should set aside some place that may be-\ncome permeated with spiritual vibrations of prayer and God-contemplation.\nThus its atmosphere will be especially conducive to meditation.\n\n"}

You will need a small table, about as high as your chest when\n\nyou are seated, anda straight chair covered with a woolen blanket that extends\n\ndown under your feet (to insulate you from earth currents). Lay a pillow on\n\nthe table. Then seat yourself and place your elbows on the pillow. The el-\n\nbows should be just high enough so that you have no difficulty in reaching the\n\nears with the thumbs; the spine and head must be held straight at the same\n\ntime. This matter of position is very important, as the spine must be erect.\n\nYou will have to experiment, adding more pillows to the table if necessary,\n\nuntil the right height is reached for maintaining the proper position in comfort.\n\nMETHOD OF God has enabled you, by means of your eyelids, to close your\nPRACTICE eyes and shut off distractions during meditation; He has also\n\ngiven you 11€ 2114811 to shut off mind-diverting sounds during\ndeep concentration. These are the cartilaginous flaps (called tragi) at the ex-\nternal ear openings. With your thumbs push them gently in so that they close\nthe ear holes, serving as stoppers to shut out outer sounds. During medita-\ntion the thumbs tend to loosen their pressure, so at the outset press firmly\nenough with the thumbs to close the tragi comfortably tight over the ear open-\nings and thus shut out external sounds as much as possible. Cotton may be\nused if you have sensitive ears.\n\nWhen you have placed your thumbs gently over the ear openings, place\nyour little fingers over the lowered eyelids, at the outer corners. Very gent-\nly press against the eyeballs so that they do not move restlessly. Place the\nother fingers of both hands on the forehead. Turning the eyeballs upward and\ninward, converge your gaze at the central point in your forehead above and\nbetween the eyebrows. Practice will make it easy. This practice is beneficial\nto the eyesight when rightly done as described in this Lesson.\n\nKeep your eyes fixed at this Christ Consciousness center for longer and\nlonger periods when you practice. This will train the optic nerves and eyeballs\nto adjust easily to the position and thus permit the free focusing of the optical\ncurrents of the two physical eyes into the one spiritual eye. At first you may\nbe satisfied with trying to keep your eyes fixed at the point between the eye-\nae. After practice, however, you will be able to do this so that the eyelids\ndon't quiver, and the eyeballs do not move. Then you may see a few lights\noccasionally. If you do see any light, concentrate on it.\n\nBy learning to focus your eyes in this way and by concentrating on any\nlight that you see, you are preparing to see the astral light of the spiritual\neye--a luminous sun, with a dark round spot inside it and a star inside the\ndark spot. This third eye--the door to the Infinite--is mentioned in Matthew\n6:22. \"If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. \"1\nMany other lights will come, but no matter how long you have to practice do\n\nnot be satisfied until you get the one mentioned above. Should you be bothered @\nwith hallucinations, keep the eyes open, turned upward, and fixed on the point\nbetween the eyebrows.\n\n"}

You may\nhear in the beginning the purely physical vibratory sounds caused by the heart,\nlungs, diaphragm movement, circulation, and so forth. Godeeper. As you\ncontinue to listen, your concentration will deepen of itself and you will begin\nto hear the musical vibratory sounds of the subtle astral centers in the spine.\n\nConcentrate with the greatest intensity of mental effort on any sound vi-\nbration that comes to you, and be one with it. Immerse your mind in it. Let\nthe mental chanting of Om and the holding of the eyes in the upturned position\nbe done automatically--without mental effort. All your concentration should\nbe on listening to the different vibrations you will hear, first the physical and\nthen, as you listen more deeply, the astral. There will come a time when you\ncan hear the Om sound--which is like the roar of the ocean. If by chance you\nhear the ocean-roar sound first, you won't have to concentrate on any other\nsound. Listen intently to Om and feel your consciousness expanding with its\nvibrations, like an ever enlarging sphere, into eternity. You may be content\nthat you are making progress toward hearing the real Om sound when you hear\nin the right ear the sound of a great gong or bell emanating from the dorsal\ncenter inthe spine, opposite the heart.\n\nVariations of the Om sound emanate from the various cerebrospinal <~\nters. All of these sounds will come to you by and by, through regular, deep\npractice of the Om Technique of Meditation. The four lower centers in the\ncerebrospinal axis control the elements in man of earth, water, fire, and air.\nThe vibratory activities of each center produce a characteristic sound. In\nmeditation the yogi may hear first the hum, as of a bumblebee, emitted by the\nearth or coccygeal center at the base of the spine. The water or sacral center\nhas a flutelike sound; the fire or lumbar center a harplike sound; and the air or\ndorsal center a bell-like sound. The etheric or cervical center, at the base\nof the neck where it joins the spine, emanates a sound as of rushing waters;\nand at the medulla oblongata the deeply meditating yogi hears the symphony of\nall sounds together--the oceanic roar of the Cosmic Om Vibration. It is this\nsymphony of sound that you are striving to hear, above all, when you practice\nthe Self-Realization Fellowship Om Technique of Meditation.\n\nAfter you have practiced listening for the Om, you may put forth active\nmental effort once or twice to see the light of the spiritual eye in the forehead.\nBy practicing faithfully you will be able always to see the light with closed\neyes, while hearing the vibrations with closed ears. It takes long practice to\nbe able to see the light at will with open eyes. When one can do that, it shows\ndistinct spiritual advancement. However, listening for Om is the most impor-\ntant, more important than seeing the light. This cosmic sound, expression of\nthe Cause of creation, is omnipresent; hence by being one with it, one 26 -\nquires the same quality of consciousness.\n\n"}

Apply that calmness in the practical situations of life--\nin dealing with people, in studying, in business, in thinking, in controlling\nyourself, in getting rid of any fixed mental or physiological habit or condition\nthat you consider unnecessary or harmful, and so forth. Whenever situations\ndemand discrimination and wise action, recall immediately the calmness felt\nduring and after concentration; fall right into that mood, and meet situations\nfrom that calm center.\n\nWhile practicing concentration, deep intensity of mind is necessary, but\nthere should be no feeling of physical or mental strain. Practice with rever-\nence and feel that in calmness, and in listening to the vibration, you are con-\ntacting the Great Spirit who is present within you as Soul, and whose expres-\nsion is Cosmic Vibratory Sound--the vibration of Bliss. You will positively\nfeel results after faithful practice. Even in the beginning the earnest student\nwill get the valuable results of calmness and joy. Calmness you will certain-\nly have. Deep intuitions come after prolonged practice.\n\nFurther, this technique will put you, by and by, in touch with the unex-\nplored reservoir of soul power. Do not be impatient. Keep on! Make study\nand application of the SRF Lessons a part of your regular routine, as much\na part of your day as eating or sleeping. The most beneficial effects flow\nsilently over the whole mental and physiological constitution. As in every-\nthing else, highest results cannot be attained in one day. Practice--practice\nand apply! This Lesson is founded on tried and proven,experience, from the\ntime of India's Golden Age down to the present day. Self-Realization Fellow-\nship students all over the world write to us, telling about their contact with\nthe One Spirit as a result of their faithful practice of this technique. Every-\none can have the same glorious experience if he perseveres. Without regular\npractice, which brings these changes in the inner consciousness, the student\nwill not realize his goal. But with faithfulness in daily meditation, the bliss\nof Om will come.\n\n"}

If morning, noon, and night you keep yourself dream-\ning, feeling, and intuiting the all-attracting divine magnetism, you will devel-\nop a spiritual power that can draw desired objects from a distance, that can\nuplift others by the mere contact of sight, or even by your simple wish or your\npowerfully directed uplifting concentration. By this power you can draw friends\nfrom afar--those who have been real friends before. By this power you can\nmake the elements bow to your wishes. By the invitation of the divine magne-\ntism you can draw angels, the luminous creative forces, sages and saints of\nbygone eras on earth to come to you and dance in your inner temple of joy.

''Perhaps because the sacrilegious young fool was trying to poke You with\na bamboo pole?\"\n\nThe Lord laughed heartily, and seemed to be thinking about the impudent\nyoung man for some time before He turned His attention to the sulky-faced\nNarada. ''O My Narada,\" He said lovingly, ''don't be angry and sarcastic with\nMe, for I shall prove to you which of these two men you have just told Me about\nis My true devotee. 1\" Having captured Narada's interest in the experiment,\nthe Lord continued: ''This is really very simple. Go back to earth again, and\nfirst repair to the anchorite Bhadraka under the tamarind tree and say: 'I\ngave your message to the Lord of the Universe, but He is very busy now, pass-\ning millions of elephants through the eye of a needle. When He gets through\ndoing this, He will visit you,' After you get the anchorite's reaction to that,\nthen go and tell the same thing to the drunken young man and watch his reac-\ntion. Then you will understand. \"'\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 246, "text": "S-2 P-29 8\n\nAlthough Narada was baffled by the Lord's instructions, he had long since\nlearned unquestioning faith in the commands of the Lord, so he thought him-\nself back to earth, and was at once standing under the tamarind tree, face to\nface with the long-suffering anchorite. The ancient one looked up at him ex-\npectantly, but when the strange message had been delivered, he flew into a\nrage and began to shout. '\"Get out, you mocking messenger, and your lying\nLord, and all the rest of your crazy crowd. Who ever heard of anyone pass-\ning elephants through the eye of a needle? What it means is that He'll never\ncome. Maybe there isn't any Lord to come anyway. '' He was now trembling\nwith fury and brandishing his pilgrim's staff. ''I've wasted my life! This\neighty years of discipline was nothing but folly! I'm through, do you hear?\nthrough trying to please a crazy non-existent God. Now 1am sane again. For\nwhat little is left of life Iam going to resume my long-neglected earthly pur-\nsuits. \"'\n\nNarada was too horrified to say a word, so he just disappeared. But the\nsecond part of his mission was not yet fulfilled; dubiously he came again to the\nroadside where he had met the noisy young man. The fellow was still there,\nand if possible, more drunk than ever. The fence was not yet completed, and\nhe was laboring to bring the holes and bamboo poles together. But no sooner\nhad Narada appeared on the scene than the youth's earthly intoxication seemed\nto leave him. In its place, the premonition of great joy caused a divine intoxi-\ncation which lighted his features as he came running and crying, ''Hey there,\nNarada, what is my Friend's reply to my message? What is His answer?\nWhen 18 He coming 21\n\nWhen he heard the Lord's strange message he was not at all disconcerted,\nbut began to dance around and around with joy, half speaking, half chanting:\n\"He who can send worlds through the eye of a needle in an instant if He desires,\nhas already finished passing those elephants through the eye of a needle. Now,\nany minute, He will be with me, and when He comes He shall touch me but once\nand I shall change. All my evil actions and bad habits will be drowned in my\noverwhelming love for Him.\"\n\nSo the young man danced in heavenly ecstasy, as do many devotees in India\nwhen divine joy becomes too great for their bodies, The feeble flesh cannot\nhold such immense bliss and--lest the very atoms fly apart and release their\nenergy to the Divine Source which calls them--this bliss spills over into tears\nor into rhythmic movements of kirtana, into singing and dancing as an expres-\nsion of this joy. And now as the young man danced blissfully, Narada joined\nhim; and soon they found the laughing, lotus-eyed Lord was dancing with them.\n(To be concluded)\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nIam the Cosmic Ocean of sound and the little\nwave of the body vibration in it.\n\n"}

No, they bring a little\nOF LIFE pleasure for a while, but sorrow always follows. They prom-\nise joy, but they do not keep their promise. Those who amuse\nthemselves too much with material, earthly pleasures will lose their happi-\nness; those who overindulge in sex life lose their vitality; those who eat too\nmuch lose their health, and the satisfaction in eating. Everywhere you go,\npeople are reaping the harvest of wild oats sown earlier in life. ''The wages\nof sin 18 death.'' Sin is ignorance--ignorance of God's cosmic laws of life.\nOnly by living in harmony with His laws do we accomplish the noble purpose\nof human existence. God never punishes us; we punish ourselves, according\nto the law of cause and effect. If we sow good deeds, we reap happiness; if\nwe sow the opposite, we reap troubles of many different kinds and degrees.\nOld age, worries, disease, and death are only a few of the effects of sin, or\nignorance of the universal law.\n\nIt seems a very futile aim for this life merely to live and die at the end\nof it. We all hope that the end of our lives will be good and pleasant. Down\nthe trail you must go to the very end; if you have followed the right path, you\ncannot help but meet God there. Avoid the path of material desire that leads\nonly to an abyss of discontent.\n\nEvery good action that you perform digs like a pickax into the soil of\nconsciousness and brings forth a little spray from the fountain of God's joy.\nBut the pickax of meditation, which is the highest form of good action, opens\nthe inner surface of consciousness and lets all the joy of life spout forth.\nThrough the orifice of silence, the whole geyser of Bliss perpetually shoots\nup and flows over the soul.\n\nGOD IS EVER You will find, by continued practice of meditation, that\nNEW JOY you will gain perceptions of an ever new, ever increasing\njoy, a joy that is not just an abstract mental state of\nshort-lived mortal pleasure, but the God-joy of meditation that will receive\nand respond to your prayers. Then you will hear the Cosmic Sound coming\nout from Spirit, and in that Sound you will have the joy of Spirit for your very\nown, and the answer to all things will be yours for the asking when you listen\nto that Sound. We are all seeking happiness, a happiness that does not come\nand go. We want lasting happiness. We do not want the kind of happiness\nthat will grow stale. We want ever new joy. Once you really experience in\nyour souls what ever new joy is, then automatically you will realize in it\n\n"}

No! Such a thought would be self-contradictory,\nabsurd. The love of existence, however, is not our supreme desire. If it\nwere, there would be no suicides; no one would ever have the thought of ending\nall his troubles by killing himself.\n\nWe do not wish for further existence when it has become sorrowful. We\nwant it joyful. Nor do we want joyful existence in an unconscious state. We\nwant to enjoy our happiness and our existence consciously. Then what is the\nlink between ever new joy and eternal existence? Eternal consciousness.\nThat is what God is--ever-expanding, ever-conscious, ever-new Joy. It is\nthis Joy that all people are seeking, either directly through the soul, or indi\nrectly through false sense pleasures. When satiety, boredom, disappoint-\nment, and pain arise from our error in seeking joy through the senses, we\nfinally turn our attention to God and thus find the only source of true joy.\n\nPURPOSE OF All vibrations produce sound. The gentlest and the loud-\nHEARING THE est sounds proceeding from creation are unheard by the\nOM SOUND human ear, which cannot catch sounds ranging below 16 or\n\nabove 20,000 cycles (approx.) per second. This Lesson\nteaches you how to hear, through the ear of intuition, the Cosmic Sound, the\nsymphony of all the sounds in the universe. In deep meditation, when the\nphy sical sounds (heartthrob, circulation, and other organic activity) and the\nastral music (bell, harp, flute, and so on, emanating from the electric\nactivity of the astral body) die down, the meditating devotee hears the sound\nof Om, the Cosmic Vibration.\n\nWe already know that physical sounds are silently roaming in the ether,\ndetectable only by radio. The finer vibrations of the all-pervading cosmic\nsound of Om similarly roam the universe. These vibrations are more subtle\nthan the ether. They are hidden beneath the cosmic forces, and beneath intel-\nligence and thought. This Cosmic Sound can be caught only when the heart-\nradio of the deeply meditating devotee is tuned to Om's rate of vibration.\n\n` € you shut off your auditory sense telephone completely, you will\nhear that great sound of Om hidden beneath the screen of bodily and astral\nsounds. The most important of the five sense telephones is the ear telephone.\nFirst we learn how to shut it off completely; then we can learn how to shut\noff the fainter sounds in the inner parts of the body. Last of all, the sounds\nof the astral body must be shut off. When you have learned to do this, your\nbody will vibrate like the sound of a drum or the ocean roar, with a great\nmusical rhythm. When you actually hear this sound, and feel the cosmic\nmusic spread through every particle of space, then you will know God. And\nyou will know that you know God.\n\n"}

There is no limit to the heights that you can attain.\nSRF is giving you the technique; by using it, you can attune your conscious-\nness to the Infinite Consciousness. Oneness with God is not mental chloro-\nform. Oneness. with God is the expansion of your consciousness from the\nlimits of the mortal frame to the utmost bounds ofeternity. It is interesting\nto note that the church bells had their origin in the temple bells of India.\nTheir sound is an attempt to copy the great cosmic sound of Om; as are also\nthe sounds of the many different kinds of drums that supply the rhythms\npeculiar to various races. Why do such things as bells and drums stir your\nblood? It is because they appeal to that hidden knowledge within you of the\ngreat cosmic Om.\n\nThe Cosmic Sound is omnipresent. Anyone tuning in with it will find his\nconsciousness expanded into omnipresence. Momentarily detached from iden-\ntification with your personality in your expanded consciousness of Om, you\nwill behold the cosmic ocean of God's consciousness and the wave of your con-\nsciousness existing together as one. As saltwater sealed in a bottle does not\ncontact the ocean even though it floats in the ocean, so the soul-reflection of\nSpirit-- sealed in the body-bottle by the cork of ignorance--cannot contact God\neven though it lives in the ocean of His presence. When the jar is opened, the\nsaltwater in it becomes one with the sea; so the contact of Om pulls out the\ncork of ignorance from the bottle of human consciousness, releasing the body-\nimprisoned soul to merge in the sea of Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nIf you were to hear a conch shell blown in a room, you would hear the\nsound in every part of the room, for sound vibration travels like an expanding\nsphere. Om is the special vibration of the Cosmos, and if you tune in with it,\nyour consciousness begins to expand until it takes in the consciousness of every\natom of space in the entire sphere of vibration. Om is the bridge between\nhuman consciousness and Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nJust listening to the sound once or twice in a few years is not enough. By\npractice of this and higher lessons, and with the help of your Guru, you should\napply yourself until you learn to reach the Cosmic Sound in space. In the\nbeginning, Om is just a comforting sound; but to the advanced student the Om\nsound is felt as all life. You can feel Om in huge land continents, and in vast\nspheres of space. You can feel the rotating of the earth and other planets in\nthe sky, or millions of feet walking on your brown earth body; or myriad stel-\nlar systems glittering like diamonds on your cosmic body of infinite space.\n\nTIME TO PRAY Closing the ears with the thumbs, shut off all outer\nsounds.

When the eyes become calm and quiet, you should be able to see a\nlight, but it is more important that you hear the astral sounds of the cerebro-\nspinal centers, or the Om sound. When you have closed your ears and shut\noff all the sounds of outside matter (auto traffic, people talking, and so on),\nthen you will hear the mighty beatof your heart. Listen to it until you hear it\nno longer; then listen to the different sounds that come, one by one, concen-\ntrating upon only one sound atatime. After you find the heartbeat or sound\nof the circulation stopped, then you will probably hear astral music of the\nspinal centers. First you may hear the buzzing of a bee, then a flute, then a\nharp seemingly playing beautifully far off in the distance. This is the harp of\nheavenly astral music. Then you may hear a sound as of a huge gong-bell;\nand finally will follow the great rolling sound of Om like a bursting sea--like\nthe sound of many waters.\n\nIf you can hear the Om sound first, do not listen for any other sounds, but\nconcentrate upon that; be one with that. But if you cannot hear Om, listen to\none sound at a time inthe right ear no matter whether it is a physical or an\nastral sound, until you get the Om sound. When you get that, it is unnecessary\nto hear the astral sounds. God is that Cosmic Sound. When you hear the great\nsound of the universe, that is the time to pray. Then ask God for your heart-\nfelt desires. ।\n\nYour mind is a broadcasting microphone, but it is out of order, broken by\nthe hammers of restlessness. Self-Realization Fellowship concentration and\nmeditation techniques help you to tune your threefold radio of body, mind, and\nsoul with God permanently, so that you may receive physical, financial, men-\ntal, and spiritual healing vibrations from Him. When you learn to repair your\nrestless microphone of mind by meditation, you can broadcast your SOS to\nGod until you find conscious response from Him.\n\nYou must keep flashing your soul's demand for an audience continuously\nand unceasingly until you get a reply from God in the form of spiritual ecstasy\nand an ever-increasing thrill of joy. Then you will know that God is waiting\nin your heart as joy to hear your petition. Whatever good desires you have,\npray for them then, and you will know that God has answered the prayer of\nyour soul.\n\nMost people have fitful inspiration, derived from the subconscious; but\nthose who contact Om derive their inspiration from the unlimited, God-guided\nsuperconsciousness. Before writing, or before undertaking any important\nmaterial or spiritual venture, be sure to listen to the cosmic sound of Om,\nand merge in it. When filled with the joy of this cosmic guidance, pray: ''I\nwill reason, ‘I will will, I will act; but, Cosmic Sound, guide Thou my reason,\nwilland activity, to the right thing that I should do.\"\n"}

After long and intense medita-\ntions, held regularly, the time will come when God will talk to you, perhaps\nin the form of a saint; or He may come to you as a great all-solacing Light.\nDo not find fault with the Lesson or the technique when you do not obtain\nresults. Find fault with your distracted meditation. You only grow by deep\nmeditation and intelligent, controlled activity. The deeper you meditate\nand the more willingly you serve, the happier you will be. And remember,\nevery wrong that you do others, you do to yourself first in thought and deed\nLet your mind and soul be cleansed. Every day happier than yesterday; that\n18 the standard of spiritual life; and if you find that you are not growing\nhappier and happier, you are going backwards.\n\nTHE BAD MAN WHO WAS PREFERRED BY GOD (conclusion)\n\nMORAL If you ever feel smug about practicing the techniques, I hope you\n\nwill think of this story and be jolted into seeing things again in\ntheir true perspective. Practice of technique is not enough. Intellectual\nattainments are not enough. Going to church regularly or performing good\nactions in a mechanical way because \"it is the thing to do\" will never bring\nSelf-realization.\n\nStudents who resemble the anchorite may strive for years, only to turn\naside from the path in a moment if faulty reasoning misleads them. Like the\nanchorite who \"knew'' that elephants cannot pass through the eye of a needle,\nthey try to limit God's powers and manifestations to conform to their ow\nsmall comprehension. But devotees who resemble the young man know that even\nif they have not been able to give up bad habits they can bring God closer\nand closer by constantly calling upon Him and expecting Him to be present at\nall times -- to take part in their daily lives as well as to respond to them\nin their moments of prayer. They know that all things are possible to God,\nand that most understanding lies beyond the intellect. When the devotee\ninsistently demands the assistance and presence of God, lovingly visualizing\nHim and believing in His Omnipresence, then the Lord will reveal Himself in\nsome form. With the dawning of the light of His revelation, the darkness\nof evil habits will automatically be banished to reveal the untainted soul.\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nI am the captain of the ship of my judgment, will, and\nactivity. I will guide my ship of life, ever beholding the pole-\nstar of His peace shining in the firmament of my deep meditation.\n\nREE\n\n"}

It is\noperative during wakefulness, but inactive dur-\ning sleep. The subconscious mind, on the other hand, never sleeps. During\nthe daytime it is awake and at work with the conscious mind, making memory\nrecords for it. At night, while the conscious mind is asleep and the body is\nat rest, the subconscious mind remains awake looking after the functions of\nthe heart, lungs, and other vital organs, tending the human body-house like\na faithful janitor. In addition, the subconscious mind is the manager-operator\nof mental dream-movies in dreamland.\n\nThe conscious and subconscious minds are identified with mortal ego\nconsciousness. The superconscious mind expresses the pure intuitive con-\nsciousness of the immortal soul. The superconscious mind works first\nthrough the subconscious mind, then through the conscious mind, without\nbecoming entangled with either.\n\nDreams do not come to us from some outside source. They originate\nin the consciousness of the dreamer. One's own conscious, subconscious,\nor superconscious mind can create any dream imaginable and project it on\nthe screen of subconsciousness. Since dreams are produced only during\nsleep (when the subconscious mind alone is operative) or in other states\nwherein pure subconsciousness is manifest, it is apparent that subconscious-\nness is the screen on which all dream films are projected, whether they\noriginate in the conscious, the subconscious, or the superconscious mind.\n\nIn sleep the life force withdraws from the sensory nerves, and partially\nfrom the heart, and accumulates inthe brain. True dream films of comic\nand tragic happenings of the past lie hidden in the grooves of the brain, all\n\n"}

These films stored in the subconscious mind become\nvivified and magnified by the accumulated life force in the brain during the\ndeep relaxation of sleep. The stored-up life force percolates through the brain\ngrooves containing the various kinds of dream films or memories, and by\nstrange combinations produces different kinds of motion pictures, which are\nthen projected on the screen of subconsciousness.\n\nThe subconscious mind is a multiple personality. In addition to serving\nas a screen on which the inner dream films are shown, it acts sometimes as\na cameraman, sometimes as a director, and sometimes as the operator who\nprojects the inner films. Thought films made by the cameraman of the con-\nscious and the superconscious minds collect in the chamber of the subcon-\nscious. Sometimes the subconscious mind, acting as a projectionist, is super-\nconsciously guided to forecast coming events: The cameraman of the all-see-\ning superconscious mind may photograph a true happening that is taking place\nelsewhere, or that is about to take place in the life of the dreamer, and drop\nthe film in the movie house of the subconscious, to be played for the guidance\nof the erring ego. Superconscious films thus dropped into the subconscious\nchamber and projected on the screen of subconsciousness are true dreams\nor visions. Films dropped by the conscious-mind cameraman into the mem-\nory chamber of the subconscious mind are often mixed up and projected as\nvarious kinds of false or imaginative dreams, but sometimes they may be\ntrue dreams. Unless consciously (that is, at will) or superconsciously in-\nduced, dreams are generally meaningless and false. Only dreams that are\ntrue visions are those consciously produced in the spiritual eye.\n\nAs in real motion pictures, the subjects of the interior movies are var-\nious. There are newsreels, tragedies, comedies, and so on. These may be\ndream re-enactments of actual happenings, or purely imaginary original pro-\nductions. A dream, being a visual image, is more real than ordinary thought\nor imagination.\n\nA developed yogi can concentrate upon a single thought, at the same time\ncompletely relaxing the body as in sleep, and produce consciously a true\ndream or vision. A vision consists of the filming, by the all-seeing super-\nconsciousness or soul intuition, of a future event.\n\nWhen you are able to shift the searchlight of your attention and energy\nfrom conscious to superconscious dreaming, enjoying peace at will, you will\nfeel complete freedom from the troubles of this mundane world. At will, you\nwill fly from the planet of physical sensations to the planet of dream sensa-\ntions, or astral consciousness; or to the superconscious sphere of eternal\npeace. In order to shift your consciousness from the conscious to the sub-\nconscious, your body must also manifest all the signs of sleep; the life force\nand energy must be switched off from the lamps of billion-celled muscles,\nand from the optic, auditory, gustatory, olfactory, and tactual nerves.\n\n"}

The super- @\n\nconscious uses brain energy to materialize thoughts\nabout a true event which is to happen in the near or far future, and shows it\nto the yogi during the wakeful state with the eyes closed. When a true vision\nis seen with open eyes, the life force has been projected from the brain into\nthe ether. In this case the persons and scenes in the brain may not be true\nto touch, though they are true to sight, and will be true to all five senses,\nin time, if spiritual development is continuous.\n\nVisions can be had only by going deep into meditation and then wishing to\nsee the real state of things. Visions are real, whether seen during the wak-\ning state or as dreams during sleep. Ordinary dreams, however, are only\nimaginary images. One who is able to dream at will is more likely to be able\nto have a real vision. To be able to dream at will signifies that your will can\nmaterialize thoughts, and that you are becoming prepared to produce guiding\nvisions. Visions of true future happenings are very useful in guiding and mold-\ning your life, when you can produce them by superconsciousness or by Christ\nConsciousness. The enlightened man seldom dreams any false dreams, where-\nas the ordinary man seldom has any true dreams.\n\nIt is better not to dream unintentionally at all, but to be able to produce\nat will true dreams and visions. Why be imposed upon by dreams? You don't\nwant your moviehouse of dreams fully working when you are trying to rest.\nWhen dreams do come too often, you should meditate and calm yourself; then\nthis condition will disappear. The more calm you become, the less you will\ndream. You should be able, by deep meditation and advancement on the path,\nto dream true dreams at will, or to produce visions of distant events by the\nall-seeing power of the superconsciousness within you.\n\nIn superconscious dreams, the superconscious mind photographs future\nhappenings and drops them into the dream-movie house, to be filmed there\nfor the guidance of the ego. These dreams, good or bad, always come true.\nThe superconscious mind is especially interested in dropping messages that\nwill awaken the ego to its true soul-nature and thus keep it from wallowing\nin the mire of sense attachments. In addition to occasionally producing dreams\nto lead the ego to return to its real home of happiness in God, the supercon-\nscious mind also produces dream hints of spiritual progress, and of the call\nof God.\n\nVISIONS Whenever you dream calmly about big fires, the ocean,\nANALYZED rivers; boats,angels, scriptures, saints, temples, chur-\nches, altars, flowers; cloudless skies, sunny lights, aur-\nOras, or the moon, or a feeling of expansion in space, you may be sure\nthat, owing to the cumulative power generated by your good actions in this\nlife, you are nearing that time in your spiritual development when the kar-\nmic consequences of prenatal or postnatal bad actions will finally have been\n\nworked out.\n\n"}

As the days\npassed and the baby lion grew heavier within her, she had a hard time mov-\ning around in quest of prey. Even when the lioness successfully stalked some\ncreature she wasn't quick enough to pounce, and so failed every time to cap-\nture her prey.\n\nRoaring with sadness, heavy with the baby lion, and pining with hunger,\nthe lioness roamed through the forest and finally fell asleep in the shade of\na grove of trees bordering a pasture. As she was dozing, she dreamed that\nshe saw a flock of sheep grazing. Trying to pounce upon one of the dream\nsheep, she jerked and woke up to behold in reality a large flock of sheep\ngrazing nearby.\n\nOverwhelmed with joy, forgetful of the baby lion she was carrying in-\nside her, and impelled by the madness of unappeased hunger, the lioness\npounced upon a young lamb and disappeared into the depths of the jungle.\nThe lioness did not even realize that, owing to the severe exertion of her\nmad leap for the lamb she had given birth to her cub.\n\nThe sheep were paralyzed with fear at the attack, but when the lioness\ndeparted and the panic was over, they wakened from their stupor and noticed\nthe loss of the lamb. As the flock bleated out lamentations in sheep language\nthey noticed, to their great astonishment, the helpless baby lion mewling in\ntheir midst. One of the ewes took pity on the cub and adopted it as her own.\n\nSeveral years passed; the orphan lion, now a mature beast with long\nmane and tail, roamed with the flock behaving exactly like a sheep. Bleat-\ning instead of roaring, and eating grass instead of meat, this strictly veg-\netarian lion had perfected himself in the weakness and meekness of a lamb.\n\nIt so happened that one day another lion strolled out of the nearby forest\nwhich opened into the green pasture and to his delight beheld the flock of\nsheep. Thrilled with joy and whipped by hunger, the strong: lion pursued the\nfleeing flock of sheep, when, to his great amazement, he noticed the husky\nsheep-lion, tail high in the air, also fleeing at top speed ahead of the sheep.\n\nThe pursuing lion paused for a moment, switching his tail in astonish-\nment and pondering within himself: \"I can understand sheep flying away from\nme, but I cannot imagine why a stalwart lion should run too. This runaway\nlion interests me.'' Spurred by determination to get to the fleeing lion, he\nraced hard and pounced upon the escaping beast. The sheep-lion fainted with\nfear. The other lion was more ‘puzzled than ever. Slapping the sheep-lion\nout of his swoon, he rebuked him in a hoarse voice: 'Wake up! What's the\nmatter ? Why do you, a brother lion, fly away from me?\"\n\nThe sheep-lion closed his eyes and bleated out in sheep language: \"Please\n\n"}

Iam just a sheep from yonder flock that fled away\nand left me.\" ''Aha! Now I see why you are bleating, '' said his captor. He\npondered a moment, then seized the mane of the sheep-lion with his mighty\njaws, and dragged him toward a lake at the end of the pasture land. When\nthey reached the shore of the lake, he pushed the deluded creature's head\nover the water so that it was reflected there, and began to shake him vio-\nlently, for the sheep-lion still had his eyes tightly closed. ''What's the mat-\nter with you?\" asked his captor. \"Open your eyes and see that you are not\na sheep.\"\n\n'Bleat, bleat, bleat! Please don't kill me. Let me go! Iam not a lion,\nbut only a poor meek sheep, 1! wailed the silly beast. The other lion, angry\nnow, gave his captive a terrible shake. Under the impact of it, the sheep-\nlion opened his eyes and was astonished to see in the water a reflection, not\nof a sheep's head, as he expected, but a lion's head, like that of the one who\nwas shaking him with his paw. Then the big creature said in lion language:\n\"Look at my face and your face reflected in the water. They are the same;\nand this voice of mine roars. It does not bleat. You must roar instead of\nbleating. ''\n\nThe sheep-lion, convinced, tried to roar, but at first succeeded only in\nproducing bleat-mingled roars. But under the slapping paws and exhortation\nof his new friend, he at last succeeded in roaring effectively. Then both lions\n\nleaped across the fields, ‘and together pursued the flock of sheep, finally re-\n\nturning to live together in the den of the older lion.\n\nThe foregoing story fittingly illustrates how most of us, though made in\nthe all-powerful image of the Divine Lion of the Universe, remember only\nbeing born and brought up in the sheepfold of mortal weakness. So we bleat\nwith fear at the predators of sickness, lack, sorrow, and death, instead of\nroaring with immortality and power and preying on mortal delusion and ig-\nnorance.\n\nSelf-Realization Fellowship teachings are the powerful lion that will\ndrag you to the crystal pool of meditation and give you such a hard shaking\nthat you will open the closed eyes of your wisdom and behold yourself as a\ndivine lion, made in the image of the Cosmic Lion. Those of you who keep\ntrying continuously will forget your mortal bleatings of weakness and sick-\nness and death, and will roar with the power of almighty immortality.\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nIam the prince of perpetual peace playing\nthe drama of sad and happy dreams on the stage\nof experience.\n\n"}

Since you\nare a manifestation of Spirit, you should make an effort to express your infi-\nnite potentialities as you are intended todo. You should definitely determine\nyour life's vocation, by analyzing your early childhood and present life, before\nyou hastily sidetrack yourself in some incompatible pursuit or start in a wrong\ndirection altogether. Then, after you have found out the path to which you are\nbest suited, try to build around it all the creative money-making methods at\nyour command. You should maintain your money-making methods, however,\nwithin the boundaries of your idealism; otherwise the result may be that you\nhave money but not happiness. Happiness is possible only when the desire for\nmaking money cannot lure you to travel on the wrong path.\n\nWake up! It is never too late to reconstruct your life. Analyze what\nyou are and what your soul-appointed tasks are, so that you can make your-\nself what you should be. You have talents and powers that you have\nnot used; all the power that you need. There is nothing greater than the power\nof mind. Resurrect your mind from the little habits that keep you worldly.\nAnchor your mind in God so that you can smile that perpetual smile--that God-\ninspired, strong smile of balanced recklessness, that million dollar smile\nthat no one can take from you.\n\nMillions of children are started on the path of life without a specific desti-\nnation. They act like little toy engines, wound up with a little power, running\nwithout a track, only to smash up against anything that comes across their\npath. Such aimless journeys in life are the lot of most people, because in\nearly life they were not started toward the right goal, nor were they properly\nequipped with systematically developed powers that would enable them to keep\nmoving on definite paths of achievement. On this stage of life most people be-\nhave like puppet-actors, manipulated by environment, prenatal instincts, and\nkarmic destiny created in former lives. They never know what parts they can\nplay successfully, nor do they understand how they can harmonize their own\nduties with the general plan of the cosmic drama. Méillions are sleepwalking,\nso to speak, doing their duties of life as if in a somnambulistic state, unaware\nof any purpose; ignorant of the reason for their own behavior, and without any\nconception of its results.\n\nWAYS THAT LEAD You cannot remain stationary.

The law of change\ngoverns our universe. You are subject to changes that are either harmful or\nbeneficial. In this Lesson, we are considering changes that are beneficial to\nyou. You should never forget that where there is a will there is a way. The\nway best suited to your life, the way worked out after a compromise between\nyour idealistic desires and the practical duties of life, should be the path that\nyou follow. For instance, if you have a tendency toward gardening, and abili-\nty to do it, but you have to live and work in a city in order to make enough\nmoney to live on, do not give up your desire for the occupation. Have evena\nsmall garden in your backyard. But have your home in the country if possible,\nand in either case spend most of your Saturdays and Sundays, not in attending\nuseless shows, but in finding your peace in garden work.\n\nPerhaps someone has started you onthe path of a traveling salesman.\nYou try your utmost; you work hard, you think and plan, but you do not succeed.\nAnalyze yourself. You may find that from childhood you have had an inclina-\ntion to have a little garden of your own in which to grow vegetables; and to\nhave a quiet home, where you could rest, enjoy, and drink peace; and where\noccasionally you could paint a picture or two of the landscape. Perhaps this\ndesire to be a farmer-artist came percolating through your superconscious-\nness from a former existence, or it may have been strongly suggested to you\nby some person in this life or by the impression of early years spent ona\nfarm. Your mind's whole enthusiasm and ambition may have been already\nprejudiced by the latent impulse toward a life close to nature. (Of course,\ngardening is only a single example. Your innate tendencies might lead you\ntoward music, science, business, medicine, the law, etc.) The question is,\nwhy walk vocationally uphill against your own already formed tendencies\ntoward a different occupation? Most people form their innate heart's desire\nbetween the ages of three and twelve, although they may not be aware of it.\nWatch yourself carefully, and you will find running under the wavelets of your\nmany incidential desires an undercurrent of some definite desire. That ig-\nnored permanent desire, which has been always with you, coaxing you to lis-\nten to it, is the real archangel of success that you should follow.\n\nNo matter what wonderful vocation you are practicing, if it does not satis-\nfy your heart, be certain that you are not following the right path. Whatever\npath your heart's deep desire tells you to follow is your royal highway in this\nlife, the route you should travel in order to reach the abode of lasting peace\nand happiness. People are never happy traveling in the wrong direction. But\nwhile striving to follow the main vocation of your life, you should be practical\nand use your common sense. The person who follows a certain artistic path,\nwhich is paved after his heart's desire, may satisfy his aesthetic hunger, but\nmay not be productive enough to meet his own needs and his family's physical\nhunger. Every man should fulfill his duties as well as foster his talents.\n\nPLAY YOUR Your small part in the Great Play, if wrongly played, would\nPART WELL affect its success, even if the cosmic drama were perfectly\nplayed by all other souls.

Most people are unhappy because they fail to recognize the necessity\nof harmonizing their acquired personal earthly duties with their duties accord-\ning to the demands of the cosmic plan.

Inner and outer troubles are born because\nof conscious or unconscious actions in the past, somewhere, sometime. We\nmust blame ourselves for these. We should not allow ourselves, however,\nas a result of this realization, to develop an inferiority complex. You should\never affirm: \"Heavenly Father, I know that Thou art guiding me! In this tu-\nmultuous sea of trial Thou art the polestar of my shipwrecked thoughts. '' Why\nare you afraid? You are an immortal being. You are neither a man nor a\nwoman, as you may think, but a soul, joyous, eternal.\n\nEven as Jesus could manifest his love and say, when sorely tested: ७\n\"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do, '' so should you become a\nable to forgive others, even in the midst of exacting trials, and say: ''My soul\n\nis resurrected.

Let my every thought be\nsaturated with the consciousness of Thy presence. Let\nmy every feeling glow with Thy love.\n\naK IK\nTHE CHEMISTRY OF FEELINGS\n\nChemistry shows us that a combination of two elements with different\ncharacteristics may produce a third substance manifesting an altogether dif-\nferent quality. Similarly, two or more different kinds of feelings may com-\nbine to produce a wholly new feeling, expressing an entirely new quality.\nAnd, just as the chemical combination of two elements generates heat, and,\nconversely, their union may be brought about by heat, so the union of differ-\nent feelings may be accomplished by stimulation of warmth-producing heart\nqualities, or emotions.\n\nEMOTIONAL Attachment to material objects produces misery. Attach-\nCOMBINATIONS ment to spiritual inclinations produces realization. Spiri-\n\ntual attachment plus the peace found in meditation creates\nbliss. Selfishness plus egotism makes miserliness and material attachment.\nBut selfishness plus consciousness of the higher Self, which sees Itself in\nall, brings breadth of vision and spiritual perception.\n\nAmbition plus the money-making desire creates selfishness and dissatis-\nfaction. But ambition plus sympathy for others produces a higher form of\nselfishness that brings lasting joy; a selfishness that is really selflessness,\ntaking pleasure in service to others as to oneself.\n\nAnger may be violent, or tempered by reason. It is usually awakened\nwhen one's own or another's interest is hurt. The chemical combination of\nviolent anger plus self-interest or selfishness causes a psychological explo-\nsion ending in hysterics or some dangerous act. Anger plus greed and dis-\nsipation makes for recklessness, satiety, and indifference. Anger plus\ndevotion to a righteous cause--if tempered with reason--produces some\ndefinite result for good in the world.\n\nHatred of sin (error) plus scorn equals indifference and hurts oneself\nand others. But hatred of sin plus sensitiveness that seeks to avoid actions\nthat will bring suffering to others produces self-control. Hate the sinner and\nyou yourself fall in the estimation of divine law. Deep peace plus wisdom-\nguided sense enjoyment makes for self-control. Craving for pleasure plus\n\nsense enjoyment creates insatiable desire.\n\n"}

Higher feelings may be developed only by\nexercising them. Alone, ordinary feelings produce the dualities and relativ-\nities of human experiences--likes and dislikes, pleasure and pain, etc. --\nserving certain isolated purposes. But when correctly and spiritually united,\nthey produce the higher emotions, which serve to awaken inner realization.\n\nGOOD AND EVIL Generally speaking, we can say thatall the people in the\nTENDENCIES world fall into one or another of two opposite classifica-\ntions: good or evil, meditative or restless, wise or igno-\nrant, happy or sad. What is more, they mentally ''fix'' themselves in certain\ncategories, Tell an evil person to be good, or the restless one to be medita-\ntive, and both will make you feel that either they do not like to, or they can-\nnot. Their attitudes are due to previous habit, and not to a true desire of\nthe heart. Once our habits are strongly established it is extremely difficult\nfor us to change. The feeling that we cannot change is only a delusion, but\nit is very hard to overcome that delusion. Therefore do not willfully or\ncarelessly put aside good habits, but cultivate them, and develop a taste for\nthe superior, lasting happiness they bring. Otherwise you may lapse into\nweak habits and find yourself unable to change when you wish to.\n\nA man may have either very good or very evil tendencies, or somewhat\ngood or somewhat evil tendencies. An exact balance of good and evil quali-\nties is rarely to be found in anyone. There is always a little more tendency\nto good than to evil, or vice versa. It is a law of nature that if you are a\nlittle less evil than good, your evil gradually will be taken away by the great-\ner power of good; and if you have a little less good than evil, your few good\nhabits will gradually be absorbed by the greater number of evil tendencies.\nThe dominant quality, by its very preponderance, tends to attract more of\nthe same quality. ''For he that hath, to him shall be given; and he that hath\nnot, from him shall be taken even that which he hath\" (Mark 4:25).\n\nIt is just as difficult for some people to be evil as it is for others to be\ngood. But man cannot remain under the influence of error forever, because\nhe is made in the image of God. The beginning spiritual aspirant finds his\nsoldiers of discrimination guided only by the desire to be good. Later, as\nhe meditates longer and prays ardently for inner help, he finds that the calm\nconviction of latent intuition--awakening inner light--a veteran occult gener-\nal, emerges from the superconsciousness to guide the forces of discrimina-\ntion.\n\nTake away the compelling instincts of anger, fear, sense temptation,\nselfishness, and greed that are planted in man by the unseen cosmic satanic\nforce, and the world would be entirely free from evil. If these evil mental\ntraits did not exist, man's reason, or will, could not be influenced to evil\nthoughts and actions. People who are easily influenced by evil usually are\n"}

A forest fire causes\nmillions of dollars of loss to the Government; emotional firebugs, by destroy-\ning the happiness of others, similarly cause millions of dollars of loss in\ncreative thinking, and incalculable waste of human nerve-energy.\n\nPUNISHMENTS People seeking happiness should shun bad habits, which\nAND REWARDS lead to evil actions that sooner or later produce misery.\n\nLike a silently burning acid, misery corrodes body, mind,\nand soul, and cannot be endured long. It should be strictly avoided by exer-\ncising wisdom and discrimination.\n\nRemember that the repetition of a few weak actions produces habits of\nweakness. Most people allow self-created habits of weakness or failure to\nenslave them. You can save yourself from weak slavery if you have made\nup your mind to live differently, but your resolution to fight bad habits should\nbe persistent, until success is reached. Whatever your position now, it is\nyou who have put yourself there. Whatever you are now, you have made your-\nself in the distant or near past. The secret, invisible traces of your own\npast actions exercise a controlling power over present actions initiated by\nfree choice.\n\nThus it is you--through the law of cause and effect that governs all\nhuman actions--who now order yourself to be punished or rewarded. In past\nyears you probably have suffered enough; now it is time for you to parole\nyourself from the prison of your own past undesirable habits. Since you are\nthe judge, no jail of suffering, poverty, or ignorance can hold you if you\nreally want to liberate yourself.\n\nThe kind omnipresent God has never punished or rewarded you, for\nfrom the beginning He has given you the power to reward or punish yourself\nby the right use or misuse of your own reason and will. If you have trans-\ngressed laws of health, prosperity, or wisdom, you punish yourself accord-\ningly with ill health, poverty, or ignorance. Live wisely, cultivating good\nhabits that will bring happiness. Then, when evil material desire tries to\nexercise the power of habit to destroy the power of good, it will be amazed\nto find that the offspring of past good habits are ready to give resistance. It\nis very consoling to know that no matter how strong the powers of evil habit\nand material desire are, there are soldiers of good habits of this life and\npast incarnations ready at any moment to give battle. Each person must\nascertain for himself whether habits born of his good actions of the past and\npresent are gaining ascendancy in his bodily kingdom.\n\nSEEK HAPPINESS IN GOD, To be good is more charming and beneficial\nNOT IN MATERIAL THINGS _ than to be evil, yet even a few good people--\n\n"}

Every night before going to\nbed Mat would affirm: ''Day by day, in every way, lam forgiving Pat more\nand more.'' But after several months he realized that during his daily\naffirmation of forgiveness he had actually been hatching the egg of revenge-\nfulness, and that in the background of his mind he had really been praying\nfor an opportunity to straighten out his old grudge.\n\nAfter a time, Pat went to Miami for a vacation, unwittingly drawn there\nby the strangely attractive power of mutual hatred. Not suspecting any\ntrouble, he guilelessly went for a stroll one evening, although it was dark\nand drizzly. As he walked along a lonely road, he passed under the tiled roof\nof an open shed adjoining a warehouse. Unbeknownst to him, Mat, having\nfound out that his old enemy was in town, was silently dogging his steps in\nrubber-soled shoes. Mat was ready to pay back with compound interest what\nPat had done to him in Philadelphia.\n\nPitter-patter! the drizzle changed into raindrops. Under cover of their\nsound, Mat pursued his quarry more closely. He was delighted to behold on\nthe ground ahead a large tile that had evidently loosened and fallen, unbroken,\nfrom the roof of the warehouse shed. Just after Pat stepped over this fallen\ntile, Mat knocked him senseless.\n\nPat lay on the cold, muddy sod beneath the shed much longer than Mat\nhad lain on the sidewalk after the thrashing at his hands in Philadelphia, long\nago. Two hours passed. The sky had ceased to weep, and was smiling with\nmoonbeams when he regained consciousness, puzzled to find himself lying in\na pool of blood on the cold earth beneath the shed. By the moonlight peeping\nthrough the shed roof where the tile had loosened, Pat could see all around\nhim. He saw then the fallen tile, mutely yet eloquently lying near his head. .\nLooking up at the square opening in the tile roof overhead, he ५०६६ to him-\nself, ''What bad luck!

Life force is therefore the\nfirst direct condition governing our physical and mental strength. Our\nthoughts, will, feeling, and muscular power; the action of heart, brain,\nand lungs; the pancreas, liver, spleen, and other digestive organs; and\nthe glands--all depend for their existence upon the vital principle.\nLife force is the inner electricity that runs the brain factory that, in\nturn, produces and exports creative ideas and imports new impressions,\nand that looks after the management of the entire body.\n\nThe heart is the factory that cleanses the system and distributes\nfood to billions of hungry living body cells. The stomach and intes-\ntines remove from food the right nutritive elements for the repair and\nreplenishment of osseous, nervous, epithelial, adipose, and muscular\ntissues. They are a grand \"kitchen factory\" that prepares the right\nfood for the various tissues. Yet the billions of bodily cells, the\ninternal organs, and the sensory nerves are really kept alive and prop-\nerly working through one vital power. Although the physical body ap-\npears to be maintained entirely by food from the outside, the truth is\nthat externally supplied food would be useless to the body if it were\nnot converted into vitality by the secret Cosmic Life Energy.\n\nWhen you practice the SRF Recharging Exercises, you employ this\ninner life force to heal and revivify the body parts. The recharging\nand energization exercises (Lesson 8-A) are all to be done slowly,\ngently; and rhythmically; never jerkily. Every movement should be har-\nmonious. If any part of the body is especially weak, send the energy\nthere very slowly and gently as you exercise, and the part will be\ngradually strengthened. By intensity of effort you can very soon heal\nyourself of weakness in a body part, since by your concentrated practice\nof the Recharging Exercises you bring the true source of curative power,\nthe Cosmic Life Energy, into the diseased tissues. You can feel the\nactual current of energy being switched on in your body and direct it\nwherever you want it. The vibration that you feel is not voluntary\nmovement; it is caused by the charge of energy entering the body. Do\nthe exercises willingly and gladly. Except in those that call for\nbending, keep the spine straight and the body upright. The exercises\nwill give you grace.and freedom of movement. More than that, as you\nperfect your practice you will realize that you are not the body: that\n\n"}

While standing in one place, go through the motions of\nwalking, but exaggerate the upward motion of the legs: instead of rais-\ning your left foot only a few inches from the floor, raise it high,\nbending the knee, so the knee is even with the buttock. At the same\ntime bend the right forearm upward, keeping the elbow by your side.\n\nThen drop left foot to the ground, and lower the right forearm. Next\nraise right foot, until knee is even with the buttock, and bend left\nforearm up, keeping elbow at side. Then go on alternating left and\nright, walking in place. If you count each \"step\" as \"one,\" walk from\n25 to 100 \"steps.\"\n\nThe running exercise is performed by standing in one place and going\nthrough the motions of running. The knees should be bent so that the\nheel is brought up in back as if to strike the buttock. Arms are held\nstationary at the sides, elbows bent. One should run on the toes,\nlightly. A count of 50 \"steps\" is good.\n\n"}

It is therefore one of the strongest instincts\n\nand impelling forces in man, and Nature takes a silent and awful revenge on\nthose that misuse or trifle with her holy method of creation. The \"fig leaf\"\nconsciousness of evil that tries to throw a veil of unholiness on this creative\nprinciple has brought a great deal of moral and material suffering into the\nworld. The creative principle has a twofold purpose. When it is directed\ntoward the nerves embedded in the generative area, man feels an instinctive\ndesire to create physically. When it is lifted up through the spine to the\nbrain, it frees man of the desire for sex creation and confers on him divine\nillumination and power. Misuse of this creative power for sense pleasure\nmakes one matter-bound, groveling in the mud of the senses.\n\nHOW TO REGULATE Man is not culpable for the creative impulse,\nCREATIVE IMPULSE which is nature-born. Persons who are unable to\n\ncontrol this--nature's most powerful force for\npropagating the human species--are blamed by society; yet they are not\ntaught how to govern this instinct instead of being governed by it. Not even\nlifelong intellectual or medical study will enable the student to control this\ninstinct. The practical method of controlling it should be taught. Daily\nexercise and proper diet are important aids to self-control. Eat little or no\nmeat; have nuts and other proper substitutes for it, and an abundance of raw\nvegetables and fruits.\n\nOne should know that during physical passion there are five courses open\nto the individual: `\n\n1. Dissipation of creative energy--the usual practice--which is\nunnecessary, weakening, and a cause of disease and premature\nold age.\n\n2. Using the creative energy for the physical creation of a child.\n\n3. Using the energy for creating ''spiritual brain children, ' 2. €. ,\n\n"}

It is not necessary (as some imagine)\n\nto dissipate the creative energy; rather, at the moment of\npassion, one should immediately engage his mind in creative\nwork: artistic, literary, inventive, or business work--whichever\nis the most interesting to him. To follow this plan is to divert\nthe creative energy into brain channels and to convert it into\nhigher forms of intellectual and spiritual expression.\n\n4. Using the creative energy in sports or strenuous physical\nexercise; for example, the running exercise in Lesson 34.\n\n5. Withdrawing the energy, through breath, from the creative\norgans upward into the region of the medulla oblongata. Put\nyour mind on the area in the body where the generative organs\nare located and draw a deep breath slowly, thinking of the breath\nas starting from that particular area. Imagine that with the\ninhaling breath you are reversing the downward flow of the life\nenergy, drawing it from the coccyx, upward through the spine\nto the spot between the eyebrows. Hold breath and mind in\nbetween the eyebrows, mentally counting one to twenty-five or\nmore (or as long as you can hold breath comfortably), and\nthink of yourself as absorbing the passion and life current into\n\nthe reservoir of life energy present between the eyebrows and |\nmedulla oblongata. Then exhale and relax, freeing yourself\nfrom the bondage of passion. Repeat the foregoing method\nthree times with closed eyes. During relaxation, always think\nof the physical instinct as having been expelled from the body.\nDo not seek solitude. This is the teaching of the great scrip-\ntures of India.\n\nSPIRITUAL A husband and wife should be loyal to each other and try to\nMARRIAGE make each other happy in every way. The spiritual wife\nshould not forsake the unspiritual husband, nor should the\n\nspiritual husband forsake the unspiritual wife--they should try to influence\nand help each other as long as it is possible todo so. This lesson is written\nfor the sole purpose of helping those who wish to develop moral character\nand self-control; those who are seeking to restore harmony in unhappy mar-\nriages; and those wishing to prevent wrong marriages and divorces.\n\nTo trifle with physical passion is to gamble away untold joys of life.\nThe million candles of happiness in the hall of life are burned all at once by\nindiscretion in marriage. The evanescent excitement in physical communion\nis nothing compared to the bliss that follows by the regulating and the with-\ndrawing of this creative impulse up into the brain region for the procreation\nof spiritual and intellectual qualities of love, consideration, divine patience,\nsympathy, determination, keenness, calmness, realization, and knowledge\n\n"}

Married people should refrain from contradicting each other\nbefore others and from quarreling between themselves over little things.\nHusbands and wives should never discuss their troubles with others (except-\ning of course a qualified spiritual teacher or marriage counselor).\n\nLove is superior to weakness or strength in body or mind, and as such\nshould be unconditioned. Love cannot be wrested from another; it may only\nbe received as a spontaneous gift. Love grows and thrives in an atmosphere\nof tolerance, forgiveness, and trust; it is marred by jealousy. In distant\ncloseness love lives. In wrong familiarity it dies.\n\nThe ratio between love and physical indulgence is that the greater the\nlove, the less the physical craving, and vice versa. Husband and wife should\nfeel love whenever they see each other, and not the physical instinct, other-\nwise they will march toward the pitfalls of boredom, dislike, and separation.\nA husband should consider his wife to be a clean temple for creating and\ncaring for anew soul. The wife should keep her body-temple free from\nunclean thoughts. The specific nature of the mental state of parents during\nthis period of creation is the magnetic force that draws a particular type of\ndisembodied soul into the mother's body-temple. Thoughts concentrated\nupon the physical invite sensually inclined souls. Souls with a more highly\ndeveloped nature refuse the invitation of degrading physical attraction.\n\nThe Hindu scriptures say that during this period a current of life force\nis generated, which serves as a door through which disembodied astral souls\nmay enter. Good souls do not enter through this door of life current if it has\nvibrations of low passionate mentality. They turn away at adistance. They\nprefer to wait rather than to take a hasty rebirth in an undesirable place. So\nall husbands and wives should remember to cooperate spiritually, mentally,\nand physically in order to invite a sacred soul into the cell temple of sperm\nand ovum that they create. Married people should invoke good souls to\ncome and live with them.\n\nParents should prepare their minds months in advance in order to create\na spiritual child. During the specific period of creation, thoughts of invoking\na noble soul into a temple of uniting sperm and ovum cells must predominate.\nAt this time, thought should remain between the eyebrows, directing the holy\nwork of creation; it should never be allowed to run down and become identi-\nfied with passion. In married life, adultery is committed by those living\nwholly on the physical plane. Such persons are punished by boredom, mutual\nhatred, and final separation.

Undesirable physical\nconsciousness should be banished by diverting the mind to\na subject or some work that is deeply interesting to you.\n\nUndesirable creative impulse should be regulated first psycho-\nlogically and then physiologically.

Gautama thus grew into manhood\nthinking of the world as a place of endless happy events.\n\nHowever, Prince Gautama was curious about the world outside the pal-\nace gardens, and one day secretly went out with his charioteer to see for\nhimself.

Reluctantly the\ncharioteer said: ''O Prince, all human flesh is subject to sickness, decrepi-\ntude, and death. '' After hearing this, the young prince began to brood over\nthe delusion of earthly life. One night, while his wife and child slept,\nGautama took a last look at them with tear-bedimmed eyes and left in quest\nof Truth which would free mankind forever from sorrow and suffering and\nwhich would give him complete understanding of the mystery of life and\ndeath.\n\nThe prince practiced many austerities prescribed by Hindu yogis. He\nis said to have spent seven years in fasting and other spiritual disciplines.\nAt last, while meditating under a banyan tree in Bodh Gaya, India, he found\nillumination. Then he ate,and nourished his body, and began to preach in\nIndia his gospel of mercy and equal love for all creatures, man and animal\nalike. He taught complete renunciation; the goal: attainment of nirvana\n(the state of desirelessness or freedom from reincarnation). Later, his\nmissionaries spread the gospel of Buddha all over India, Japan, China, and\n\nother parts of the world.\n\nThe state of nirvana, or cessation of dualistic existence, is often misin-\nterpreted as annihilation of the self. Buddha, however, meant annihilation\nof the deluded ego, or pseudo Self; the little self must be overcome in order\nthat the real, eternal Self may achieve liberation from human incarnation.\n\nBuddha's doctrine, with its emphasis on a negative state of being (annihilation 7\nof the ego or little self) as the goal of ultimate attainment, was later sup-\nplanted in India by the doctrine of Swami Shankara, founder of the great\nmonastic Swami Order, who taught that the goal of life is the positive attain-\nment of the ''ever-conscious, ever-existing, ever-newly blissful state of\n\noneness with Spirit.

Various factors\nmay hold us back. We have to analyze life to determine what those factors may\nbe. It is necessary first to think back over one's childhood, to the time when\nfirst began to dawn the consciousness that this life is a series of changing con-\nditions imposed onus. Very early in life we become aware that certain changes,\ncertain environments into which we have been thrown, are congenial; they tally\nwith our inner ideas of comfort and pleasure, and we like them. We also dis-\ncover that certain other conditions arising from time to time thwart our desires\nand cause us discomfort and unhappiness. One naturally wants to eliminate\nthose conditions that he finds uncongenial, and to bring about those that make\nhim happy. With the growing realization that life is a series of changes, we\nalso become aware that we have to go either backward or forward as we adapt\nourselves to each new change. It is impossible to remain stationary. A man\nimmersed in the ocean has to keep moving; otherwise he will drown. To avoid\ndrowning in the ocean of life also necessitates constant change on our part.\n\nAny change in oneself that promotes happiness and well-being is good,\nwhereas changes that bring unhappiness are not good. Anything that is painful--\nmentally, physically, or spiritually--ought to be eliminated. However, much as\na person wants to avoid unsavory experiences in life, often he does not know how\nto prevent such changes--he does not realize that his own previous actions and\nattitudes have invited them. From the very beginning of life one may have suf-\nfered from fear, or sensitivity, or nervousness, or anger or some such weak-\nness without being particularly aware of the extent of it. Then suddenly there\narises a situation that brings forth the realization that one has an uncontrollable\ntemper, or a strong sexual nature, or a tendency to be greedy, or to fight with\n\npeople all the time; or to be moody, touchy, too frivolous, or too serious. | ।\n\n"}

For instance, a person who was constantly ill-\ntempered in his past life will be born with that strong tendency in this life; to\novercome that trait and its effects on his life he will have to change, by persis-\ntently employing thoughts and actions to cultivate the opposite quality of evenness.\n\nBut even though one may have found out these things about himself fairly\nearly in life, he may nevertheless find himself unable to change. Looking back\nhe realizes that whenever any of his wrong habits have tortured him he has\nwanted to get away from them. Why has he not done so?

We tend to say to\nLAZINESS RETARD ourselves, even when suffering from the ill effects\nSPIRITUAL PROGRESS of wrong habits, 11.4.85 long as I can get along some-\n\n_ how it doesn't matter. '' Such mental and physical\nlaziness is the root cause of failure to improve. We have no idea how much we\nhave to pay for mental and physical laziness! Who has not passed up opportuni-\nties--perhaps to make money, or to change for the better an unsuitable environ-\nment, or to overcome an old habit, or to make himself and others more comfort-\nable--because of lack of effort. Most people are too lazy to try as hard as would\nbe necessary to. rid themselves of evil habits, or inharmonious.environment.,,.or—... —..\nwhatever the cause of their unhappiness may be. They weakly allow wrong ten-\ndencies to take a terrible toll of their life happiness.\n\nThose who have failed to change as they wish, therefore, may simply have\nbeen mentally and physically lazy. Physical laziness is forgivable, because\nsometimes a person needs rest, but mental laziness is inexcusable. Most\npeople are extremely lazy about thinking and reasoning! Yet in thought lies free-\ndom. As soon as man thinks he will find a way out of difficulties.\n\nIn dreams a thin person can make himself fat by thinking he is fat. Such is\nthe power of thought. It is the greatest power we have. Thought controls the\nphysical, financial, moral, spiritual, in fact, all the conditions of life. Since\nman has such a great power at his disposal, why does he not change as he wishes?\nBecause of concentrating too much on the limited sources of sustenance of body\nand mind, and because of not fully using the greater power of thought.\n\nANALYZE The person who sincerely desires to change should analyze him-\nYOURSELF self. One who has not kept a mental diary should begin this\nsalutary practice. The knowledge of just how much and in what\nway he fails in the daily experiences of life may stimulate him to more effort\nto be what he should be. By keeping such a journal and by using discrimination\nto destroy the bad habits that create pain and suffering for ourselves and others,\nwe will get rid of them. Every night we should ask ourselves: ''How long have I\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 302, "text": "S-2 P-36 4\n\nbeen with God today?'' We should analyze also how much we have deeply thought,\nhow much we have accomplished in our duties, how much we have done for others,\nhow we have governed ourselves in the various situations of the day.\n\nAnalysis will reveal how much or how little power we have over our emo-\ntions and habits. Whenever a person makes up his mind in the morning that he\nwill not that day allow himself to be carried away by mechanical habits, he should\nstick to that resolution. To be free, one must snatch himself from the stream of\nmechanical habits on which he floats like a leaf toward the falls of delusion and\ndestruction. Most people don't seem to care; they let themselves drift. But the\nwise person makes this resolve: ''As long as I have to live, Iam going to do what\nI must to improve, not what I am led to do through habits I mistakenly formed in\nthe past.'' Then he carries out that resolution.\n\nKEEP GOOD Bad company frequently inhibits one's intentions to change for\nCOMPANY the better. We are certain to be influenced by the people we\n\nhave around us. Why be with people who are suspicious, or\nwho like to gossip, or who will try to make one indulge in other petty and hurt-\nful actions of which he doesn't really approve? Even a person who is sufficient-\nly developed to be safe from such influences should avoid them.\n\nA man must carefully watch his company. He who surrounds himself with\nflatterers who encourage him in his weaknesses will stifle his ability to analyze\nhimself. In time he will be afraid to mix with people who might correct him.\nRemember, the power exerted by good or bad company is greater than will\npower. Those who have a nervous or an angry temperament should mix with\ncalm, soothing persons who act as emotional shock-absorbers; thus the flighty\nones may be inspired to be calm like their friends, and so improve. But if\neasily angered persons mix with others who are as hot-tempered as they are,\nsomeone may come to actual physical harm. Even a fairly calm and self-\ncontrolled person who mixes with emotional, excitable types will tend to lose\nhis own poise and self-control.\n\nMost people are just like animals in the zoo. They are always howling with\nemotions. Man is meant to control himself. As human beings we have been\ndivinely endowed with self-control. We are not wholly free, but we have been\ngiven the key to freedom. In spite of this, many people live an animal-like exis-\ntence, not fully using their free will and intelligence to gain self-mastery. The\ntiger is controlled by the instinct to kill. He cannot help himself. But man has\nbeen endowed with free choice and intelligence, that he may steadily improve\nhis human status instead of remaining instinct-bound like the animals.\n\nATTACHMENT Attachment to material possessions is always a deterrent\nTO POSSESSIONS to spiritual progress. Some people work hard and save\nmoney for some worldly goal, and then suddenly something\nunforeseen happens. Everything is gone and they are desolate. Why? Because\nthey piaced their faith in and conditioned their happiness by material acquisitions\n\n"}

Who can be happy constantly think-\ning of his material comfort, or always fearing what will happen to his posses-\nsions when he dies, or trying to decide to whom he will leave his money! Furni-\nture and other material possessions are really burdens.\n\nSt. Francis lived in a shed; he existed solely on scraps of food given tohim.\nYet he did not suffer, for the splendor of God was within and around him because\nhe had refused to anchor his happiness on material conditions. St. Anthony lived\nin a tomb for many years; sometimes he had bread and sometimes he didn't. We\ntoo live by God's grace and not by bread; the more we concentrate on this truth\nand the less we think about the body, the more the Divine Friend will help us.\n\nOnce when I went to visit one of my students I saw that there were only\nthree people living on a very big estate, 830 1 said: ''Here you are keeping up this\nhuge place for the comfort of only three people. Why not give it प?\" But they\nwere bound to their possessions; that attachment held them back from changing\ntheir inner lives for the better. Yet furniture doesn't mean a thing to real happi-\nness! A yogi sitting on a little blanket under a tree can be one with all creation!\nHe has the furniture of God--the mountains, moon, and stars--to decorate his\nearth-home. In that consciousness lies freedom and happiness. <A yogi who is\ninwardly one with the Creator can go anywhere and feel that everything is his; he\ncan enjoy everything without taking on the burden of ownership. Nothing is really\nours; it is the consciousness of possession that makes us attached to things. Man\n\nis-meant-to live for-God in this world. As long as he lives in it for himself he ~.\n\ndoes not evolve to a higher consciousness; instead, being subject to the law of\nchange, he gradually changes for the worse.\n\nOne should not give too much importance to the home and its furnishings. It\nis all right to have and to enjoy possessions, but it is harmful to be possessed\nby them. Whether living in luxury or in simple surroundings, the yogi is free.\nSimple living does not mean being dirty or lazy. We should give attention to the\nbody that we love so much only enough to take care of it as best we can. It 18\nonly a useful beast to carry the soul through life. St. Francis used to call his\nbody \"Brother Donkey. '' He knew its true purpose, just as he knew that in the\nsimplicities of life lie the riches of renunciation; and that even poverty need not\nbe slavery but, rightly considered, freedom from the enslavement and serfdom\nof possessions. One should be a free man wherever he is placed.\n\nHow much time people spend in thinking of the things they want! And after\nthey get them they are not happy--they want something else. We should learn to\nbe happy now, by thinking of God and renouncing in our minds the desire for any-\nthing else. One does not have to retire to the jungle to do this. It takes more\ncourage to live in the jungle of civilization and be serviceful to others. But wher-\never our duties lie, we should be free men. The cobwebs and dust of delusion\nand habits that accumulate in our minds must all be cleaned away. Anyone can\nbe free, today, by changing his consciousness from that of a mortal to that of a\ndivine being. Every night we are freed from the consciousness of the body, of\n\n"}

The Lord takes us into that state where we are free from all\nburdens of existence and are neither man nor woman, rich nor poor, diseased\n\nnor healthy. In that consciousness lies happiness and freedom. Man subcon-\nsciously knows that he is made in the image of God, but realization of this truth\nis latent because he has not concentrated on that side of life. Man tends to con-\ncentrate on the ''show\"' that his soul is seeing through the senses of the physical\nbody. His body and this earth are a part of that show. God has already shown\nme how this film is going to continue. When you see it beforehand you can un-\nderstand that it is only in fun; but just the same, when the events really happen\nit is very hard to remember that it is only a show. Even Jesus said, onthe\ncross, ''My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" (Mark 15:34). The\ndelusion of the reality of this show is very strong, but he overcame it. And\nChrist taught that all men may overcome it.\n\nThe Lord as Krishna said to his disciple Arjuna: ''My delusion is very hard\nto conquer, yet it is very easy for those who persevere. '' No matter how many\ntimes one may fall down or fail, he should never stop trying to overcome delu-\nsion. We have limitless power within ourselves with which to be conquerors in\nthe greatest tests that God can give us. Saint Teresa prayed to the Lord, \"Don't\nlessen my sufferings. Let me serve fully my term.\" Yet the average person\ndreads disease, and becomes rebellious toward God whenever he suffers. That\nrebellion comes because we are not in tune with the Infinite. He who is in tune\nwith God can overcome the greatest sufferings in life. Though this cosmic dream\nis often a terrible nightmare, when we become one with the Lord we will see that | ।\nwe are free from it.\n\nUNSELFISH Constantly thinking of oneself is another root cause of suffer-\nACTIVITY ing and failure to progress. We should think of others; and\n\nespecially of God's work. If for a certain time each day we\ncommune with God, it is good; but we should also work for Him. The Lord says,\n111 the Bhagavad Gita, ''I have attained all things, yet Iwork on. And those who\nwould be free must work, not for themselves, but for Me.'' What a difference\nthat makes in life! Why seek only one's own comfort? It is so much better to\ntake away somebody else's suffering. To the spiritual man, giving is so much\nmore satisfying than doing for oneself. The average worldly man, on the other\nhand, thinks nothing of spending for himself; but when he gives a dollar to charity\nhe is all puffed up over his generosity.\n\nThose who desire to increase the comforts of others, who feel happiness in\nmaking others happy, will change for the better. He who ceases to live selfishly\nand, rather, lives for others, may escape all those mental tyrants of wrong\nhabits that he has been feeding in his brain. He will be able to overthrow the\nfeudal kings of habit that have dominated his reactions. We must dethrone\nwrong habits and become free, one with the Lord. Why should we seek posses-\nsion of things that don't belong tous? It is better to seek more balance, more\n\nself-control, more calmness. Once we have acquired these qualities, we shall @\nbe able to take them with us when we leave this earth, to help us in future\n\n"}

In the course of their missionary travels\nwith Buddha, a curious incident extremely puzzled his disciples as to the charac-\nter of their master. The great Buddha was resting with them beneath the cool\nshade of a tree when a courtesan, attracted by the glowing body and face of the\nmaster, drew near. No sooner had she beheld the celestial face of Lord Buddha\nthan she fell in love with him, and in an ecstasy of overwhelming emotion ran\nwith open arms to embrace and kiss him, loudly exclaiming: \"10 Beautiful\nShining One, I love thee!\"'\n\nThe celibate disciples were extremely astonished when they heard Buddha\nsay to the courtesan: ''Beloved, I love thee too, but do not touch me now--not\n\nyet. 11\n\nShe replied: ''Thou dost call me beloved and I love thee, why dost thou\nobject to my touching thee?\"\n\nThe great Buddha replied: ''Beloved, I tell thee again, I will touch thee\nlater, but not now. I will prove my true love for thee. '' As Buddha saw that she\nwas still not satisfied with his answer, he explained further: ''Have faith,\nbeloved! Do not doubt my words. Later when those that now love thee have\ndeserted thee I will come.'' The disciples were extremely shocked, and some\nthought that the master had fallen in love with the courtesan.\n\n"}

My beloved, the courtesan, is calling me. She needs | ।\nme now and I must fulfill my promise to her. '' As he spoke he rose and hurried\n\noff. The disciples ran pell-mell after their master, in the vague hope of res-\n\ncuing him from the temptress.\n\nThe great master and his worried disciples came at last to the same tree\nwhere long ago they had met the courtesan; and what do you think they saw? She\nlay there, her once beautiful body honeycombed with putrefying,odorous small-\npox sores. The disciples cringed and kept some distance from her, but Lord\nBuddha sat down beside her. Lifting her decaying body on his lap he whispered\nin her ear: ''Beloved, I have come to prove my love for thee, and to fulfill my\npromise to touch thee. I have waited a long time to demonstrate my true love,\nbut I love thee when everyone else has ceased loving thee; I touch thee when all\nthy summer friends do not want to touch thee any more.'' Sayingthis, Buddha\nhealed the courtesan and asked her to join his family of disciples.\n\nPersonal love is limiting, selfish, and considers its own comforts, usually\nat the cost of everyone else's. Divine love is unselfish and seeks the happiness\nof the object of love, and is not limited or partial. God loves the wicked and the\ngood alike, for they are His children; so all those who aspire to know Him must\nprove to Him that their love is like His love. When a devotee proves to the\nHeavenly Father that he loves his good and evil brothers equally, then the Divine\nFather will say: ''My noble son, thy love laccept, for thou dost love all with My | ।\nlove.'’ To love those who love you is natural, but to love those who do not love\nyou is to be supernatural and to know God in all.\n\n1,\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nI will be calmly active, actively calm.

Teach me to open my closed eyes of unbelief and behold Thy\ninstantaneously healing light.\n\naK KK\nTHE LAW OF DIVINE HEALING--Part 1\n\nPerfect health is given by God as part of man's divine birthright. Dis-\nease is man-made. A baby who is born blind, or who is in any way mentally\nor physically handicapped, brings from a former existence the mental seed-\ncause of such a condition. All disease tendencies, whether carried over from\na past life or newly created through transgressions of natural laws in this life,\nare results of humanerror. God wants all His children to enjoy health and\nhappiness, but man creates disease and sorrow for himself by breaking God's\n\nlaws.\n\nSuppose that after having enjoyed good health for fifty years you have now\nbeen sick for three years, unable to obtain healing by any method. Probably\nyou have forgotten about the length of time that you enjoyed good health and\nlaughed at the idea of sickness. Now the situation is exactly opposite. Just\nbecause you have been sick for three years, you probably have come to think\nthat you will never be well again. So is the mental attitude affected by tempo-\nrary physical conditions.\n\nThere are diseases of bacterial invasion that result from breaking laws\nof physical hygiene. There are maladies of mental bacterial invasion--of fear,\nanger, worry, greed, temptation, and lack of self-control--that result from\ndisobeying the mental laws of being; and there are diseases that arise from\nspiritual ignorance. Do not forget that ignorance of God is the mother of all\nphysical, mental, and spiritual diseases. Abolish ignorance by contacting\nGod and forthwith body, mind, and soul will be healed of all maladies.\n\nDisease results when the brittle, inharmonious manifestations of objective\nlife collide with the stone wall of divine soul harmony within. God is harmony;\nand when man, who is made in His image, tries to lead an inharmonious life,\nhe hurts himself. A stone wall does not willfully hurt the knuckles of a man\nwho strikes it. The man hurts himself through his failure to understand the\neffect of striking his knuckles on the wall. So God 15 not punishing man. Man\npunishes himself whenever he reaps the results of self-created wrong actions.\nPeaceful actions attune the mind with the peace of God found in the silence of\ndeep meditation, and the result is happiness.\n\nHUMAN METHODS OF The necessity of seeking a sure method of perma-\nCURE NOT PERMANENT nently curing physical, mental, and spiritual ills\n\n"}

Permanent cure of all troubles means complete nonrecur-\nrence of bacterial disease, of physical harm through accidents, or of any diffi-\nculty arising from a mental or spiritual cause. As repeated visualization of a\ntable laden with good food neither materializes the food nor satisfies one's\nhunger (unless he be a highly advanced yogi!), so also the visualization of\nhealth, although it may encourage the mini or offer temporary relief, does not\nbring permanent health, which is possible only when we behold God in the body-\ntemple. Then, instead of simply feeling that God is in the body, we actually\nperceive the soul, mind, and body to be a perfect manifestation of God Him-\nself. It is only after such realization, which may be brought about by deep\npractice of these Lessons, that the body remains permanently healed.\n\nNo doubt some medicines have healing power, since God gave herbs and\nminerals power to affect the body of man. Only a man who can drink a bottle\nof potassium cyanide without any ill effect may speak with authority of the de-\nlusive nature of medicine or matter.

There-\nfore, to put your entire trust in medicine rather than in God's unlimited heal-\ning power is sure to bring disillusionment.\n\nMedical science cannot guarantee the nonrecurrence of physical disease,\nnor can it promise complete healing of mental disease and the spiritual dis-\nease of ignorance. Nor does the layman's search for a mental or spiritual\ncure through reading books or by following the advice of friends insure perma-\nnent healing of mental and soul troubles. To drink all the medicines, undergo\nall the operations, or to read all the holy books in the world would still give\nonly temporary relief, for none of these methods actually destroys the possi-\nbility of recurrence of man's threefold suffering of body, mind and soul.

Suppose you have\nprayed for healing and that you have become well. Do you know whether your\ncure is due to natural causes, or to medicine, or to your own or another's\nprayers that brought help from God? Sometimes there is no causal relation\nbetween the prayer and the cure. You might have been healed even if you had\nnot prayed. This is the reason why we should find out whether we may scien-\ntifically employ the law of cause and effect through prayer. The sages of\nIndia found that God responds to law. Those who have experienced this re-\nsponse have said that all people who conform to the law may test and experi-\nence it for themselves.

Physical disease\ncomes tous because of our conscious or unconscious transgression of the laws\nof health and hygiene, and we desire to be free of its pain and discomfort.\nPrevention is better than cure because every disease leaves its mark in some\nform, and it is only by following the laws of physical, mental, and spiritual\nhealth that man can be happy. Without health, happiness is almost impossible.\nTherefore, learn how to live;-and then act upon that knowledge if you would be\nhealthy and happy.\n\nNo one is more willing to send to you vibratory healing for your health,\nfor your financial condition, for your peace of mind, and for your spiritual\ndevelopment than your own Father, God. But when you use your God-given\nindependence unwisely you fail to receive God's healing messages. Most\npeople tend to be overconfident in limited man-made methods of healing, of\nachieving prosperity, or of getting to know God, and so cut themselves off\nfrom His help.\n\nWhen wealth only 15 1051, nothing of real value is lost, for if one has\nhealth and skill one can still be happy and can make more money; but if health\nis lost, then most happiness is also lost; and when contact with the Principle\nof life is lost, all happiness and all health are lost.\n\nTHE MAN WHO BECAME A BUFFALO\n\nOn the side of amountain in India, overlooking a beautiful flower-decked\nvalley, was a cosy hermitage.

One day, however, the master\nnoticed that his young disciple was absent-minded and restless, so he gently\nsaid to him: \"Son, today your mind is not on my words, and it seems to be\nwandering over the hills elsewhere. Pray tell me, what it is that causes your\nabsent-mindedness?'' The disciple respectfully replied: \"Honored Master, I\ncannot concentrate on your lesson today, for my mind is helplessly thinking\nabout our newly acquired tame buffalo which is grazing on the green verdure\nof the valley. \"'\n\nThe guru, instead of scolding the disciple, calmly asked him to retire into\nthe silence chamber, close the door, and think of nothing but the buffalo. One\nday passed, and the next morning the master looked through the little window\nin the silence chamber. The disciple was still concentrating upon the buffalo.\nSo the master asked: ''Son, what are you doing?'' The disciple answered:\n\"Sir, Iam grazing with the buffalo. Shall 1 come to णप?! The master replied:\n\"No, son, not yet; go on grazing with your buffalo. \"1 @\n\nOn the third morning the master again looked through the window of the\nsilence chamber and inquired, ''Beloved child, what are you doing?'' To which\nthe disciple, in the state of ecstasy, replied: ''Heavenly Master, I behold the\nbuffalo in my room, and I am feeding it. Shall I come to you with my buffalo?\"\n\"Not yet, my son, go on with the vision of the buffalo, and of feeding it. ''\n\nOn the fifth day, the master questioned, ''Pray tell me, my son, what you\nare doing now?'! The disciple bellowed, in a buffalo-like voice: 'What do you\nmean? Iam not your son. Iam the buffalo!'' To this the master smilingly\nretorted: \"All right, Mr. Buffalo, you had better come out of the silence\nroom. The disciple vould not come out. \"How can I get out through that nar-\nrow door?' he rumbled. ''My horns are too big!'' Then the master went into\nthe silence chamber and brought the erstwhile \"buffalo\" out of his trance. The\ndisciple smiled to find himself walking on all fours, trying to imitate the ob-\nject of his concentration.\n\nThen the disciple, after a light repast, went to listen to the words of his\nguru. He was asked many deep, spiritual questions, all of which he answered\ncorrectly, as never before. At last the guru remarked: ''Now your concentra-\ntion has reached the perfect state, when you and your mind can be one with\nthe object of study. '' | ।\n\n"}

Keep smil-\ning within, pulsating with deep joy, ever ready to act, and spiritually ambi-\ntious to help others. These attitudes are not only good exercises for the mind;\nthey also keep the body constantly supplied with fresh Cosmic Energy, which\ndescends into the body through the door of the medulla oblongata.\n\nStrong will power pulls energy from the surrounding conscious cosmic\nrays into the body through the door of the medulla. Hence you should strength- `\nen your will power and determination in every worthwhile activity, so that\nyour body may be constantly filled and vibrant with life current. By the high-\nly vibrating current of his mind, a man with strong will power can shake out | ।\nthe thought seeds of disease, failure, and ignorance. But the will vibration\nmust be stronger than the vibration of physical disease or mental inharmony.\nThe more chronic a disease is, the stronger, steadier, and more unflinching\nshould be the determination, faith, and effort of the will to get well. ''Man\nshall not live by bread (food chemicals) alone, but by every word (vibration\nof life energy) that proceedeth (which flows into the body of man) out of the\nmouth of God (that is, the opening of the medulla oblongata through which the\nconscious cosmic Life Principle enters the body of man).\"'\n\nKEEP WINDOWS Human life may be compared to a house fitted with\nOF LIFE OPEN three windows: body, mind, and soul. Through these\nopenings come pouring into the body three divergent\nrays of the one perfect light of God: health rays, faculty rays, and wisdom\nrays. These triune rays are responsible for the perfect health, mental equa-\nnimity, and soul enlightenment of man. As a triune manifestation of God's\nperfect light, man is truly created in the image of God. But then arises the\nquestion: If man is made after God's likeness, why does he suffer in so many\nways? The answer is: Manas a divine child shares the independence of the\nDivine Being. Since he is essentially a god, created in the image of the\nFather, man has the privilege of free choice even as the great God. He may\nexercise that free choice, if he so wills, either to obscure with error the\ndivine soul image or to keep it dazzling with rays of health, power, and peace. @\n\n"}

Most people have had one or more of their win-\ndows of life shut and jammed for years. That is why they suffer from chron-\nic maladies. Their rescue lies in the knowledge and application of the law by\nwhich they may open the windows of body, mind, and soul, and bask once more\nin the all-healing conscious cosmic rays.\n\nWhen he becomes ill, man instinctively wants instantaneous healing by\nGod's power. What he fails to understand is that the power to bring about\nhealing lies within himself, and it is up to him to put that power to work. God\nis not responsible for man's sickness, nor for his healing, because God orig-\ninally gave man the privilege of free choice to receive His all-healing rays or\nto shut them out. The results of man's choice are governed by the cosmic\nlaw. God may not be bribed by special ceremonies to make arbitrary changes\nin His law. Nor does He respond to blind prayer, or out of partiality. He\nmay be moved only by man's cooperation with the law and by love. Love is\nlaw. When man has kept the windows of his life closed indefinitely to the\nlight of God, it is man who should make the effort to open those windows\nagain to let in the freely-willing-to-help, knocking-to-enter, healing light of\nGod.\n\nAll physical diseases, psychological inharmonies, and spiritual maladies\nborn of ignorance come from man's own fault of shutting out the rays of God.\nAnd the logical, lawful conclusion is: whether he shuts the health-giving win-\ndows of life knowingly or unknowingly, he must by self-effort open them again.\nIgnorance of the law may not be used as an excuse for escaping the effects of\nbreaking the law. There are many ways of opening the three jammed windows\nof life.

It roamed on\ntracts of incarnations, gathering many hard experiences. It slept in the heart\nof minerals, buried deep in the soil; slumbered and moved in the deep sea\nspaces where perpetual winter and darkness reign. Crushed and pounded out\nof the metals, it fled into the corridors of plant life, wandering through laby -\nrinthine veins of tender leaves and fragrant blossoms, emerging at last in the\nliving halls of birds and animals. Finally, it tore off its animal garments\nand put on robes of human flesh.\n\nHypnotized by human experiences, the prodigal soul became self-exiled,\nimprisoning its omnipresence in the poverty and limitation of the physical\nbody. At last the soul awakened to the dreariness of its experiences of count-\nless incarnations--the endless repetition of the wild dance with death and the\nsubsequent ejection from the mansions of minerals, clay, star dust, dream-\ning blossoms, sentient animals, and the unique human body.\n\nNow the prodigal soul is back in his Father's mansion of omnipresence\nand omniscience. He remembers the nightmares of his wanderings through\nincarnations, the horrid dance with death that crushed him and made him\nthink he existed no longer.\n\nNow he sees that no matter how he was treated, his immortality was evi-\ndent. He realizes that it isn't necessary to go through any more nightmares\nof experiences, wandering in tattered robes of incarnations, or going naked\nin Spirit.\n\nNow the prodigal soul wants to travel of his own volition in the dream-\nland of incarnations, working with the souls of minerals, blossoms, animals,\nand men, to guide them from their wanderings back to their real home--the\nmansion of omnipresence. The prodigal soul now wants to reincarnate in the\nslums of material existence until all wandering brothers of minerals, plants,\nae and men are brought back to their Father's Home of complete free-\ndom.\n\nRA\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nO Father, Thou art in my mind--I am\nThou.

Diseases start when these two great energies fail to\nenter the system in sufficient force to maintain good health. Hence one\nshould know the various avenues through which these energies may most\neffectively penetrate the body. In addition to the individual potencies\nof the life force and sunlight, there is a great deal of reaction be-\ntween them. It is the reaction between the commingling forces of the\nsunlight and life force that helps to support the human body.\n\nDoubt, mental fatigue, worry, indifference, boredom, fear, restless-\nness, timidity, mental and physical laziness, overindulgence in anything,\nunmethodical life, lack of interest, and lack of creative initiative are\ncounteracting static agents that make it impossible for cosmic energy to\ntune in with man. Working with interest and desire to help others,\ncreative spiritual ambition, calmness, courage, an unconquerable at-\ntitude, tolerance, patience, and peace are avenues through which cosmic\nenergy can help you.\n\nThis great law some know, but few put into actual practice:\n\nIf you continuously persist in thinking that your body\nis full of vitality, especially at times when it is\nweak, you will have started to open up a new, secret,\ninvisible means of vitalizing yourself.\n\nThe Bible and other world scriptures tell us: \"Man is made in God’s\nimage.\" Realize by meditation, which develops intuition and bestows on\nthe devotee direct experience of Reality, that the life and vitality in\nyour body, mind, and soul remain ever undiminished. Realize that only\nthought and consciousness exist as permanent realities. Matter may be\ncognized only through ideas; strive to realize, therefore, that in\nworking you are not using up energy, but using up thoughts of energy or\nmaterialized ideas; hence, you would never feel physical weakness if you\nwere continually to draw energy and enthusiasm from your own thoughts.\n\nPERFORM ALL DUTIES Always perform small as well as important duties\nWITH ATTENTION with deep attention, remembering that God is\nAND CHEERFULNESS guiding and stimulating every worthwhile effort\nyou are making to achieve a noble ambition. With\nthe consciousness of God in your actions, and with the performance of\nnoble actions, God’s ceaseless cosmic energy will enter your body. His @\n\n"}

Then, as you perform your daily activities, you will see\nthat a flood of vitality will move through all your muscles and through\nyour entire body. Perform your daily duties with deepest happiness,\nthinking that you are not working for yourself alone but also for God\nand His children, all as a part of humanity and not apart from humanity.\nIf you do this, undreamed-of power and happiness will come to you.\n\nWhile the muscles and limbs of your body are busily engaged in\nperforming your duties, visualize a halo of God’s cosmic energy sur-\nrounding your body, and feel that you can never become tired again\nbecause your tissues are being renewed, supplied with current from that\nenergy and not merely from food or oxygen.

Ultraviolet rays are inef-\nfective on a dead man. The method of simultaneously using life force\nand sunlight for healing is called the heliotropic or heliotherapic\nmethod. Each one of the following methods is intended to quicken the\nlife force by combining it with the sun’s rays, creating a great force\nfor the healing of different body parts. Ordinary sunbaths are par-\ntially effective, but much is yet to be learned about harnessing sun-\nlight to life force for therapeutic purposes.\n\nPractice the following methods in the morning or late afternoon\nhours. Depending on the intensity of the sun’s rays and the sensitivity\nof one’s skin, it is best for some persons to avoid the midday sun.\n\nFOR COLDS: Every day lie flat on your back on a woolen blanket in the\n\nsunlight. Expose chest, thighs, and feet. Open mouth wide\nand turn head up so that sunlight can penetrate your mouth and nostrils.\nWhile doing this, gently quiver your head by tensing it, concentrating\nupon the mucous membranes of the nose and throat. Think that the energy\nyou are sending by the vibration of quivering is absorbing and transmut-\ning the sunlight into a hot healing force that is passing through these\npassages lined with mucous membrane, and helping to banish disease germs.\nPractice for fifteen minutes.\n\n"}

Rapidly but gently rub | ।\nchest, injecting energy into it through your hands. Mentally visualize\nthat the life force in your hands is reacting on the sunlight falling on\nyour chest to create a new force that is very effective in destroying\ndisease germs of the respiratory organs. This exercise should last up\nto half an hour. Practice both morning and afternoon, and before meals,\nor when your stomach is empty. It has been found effective to fast once\na week on orange juice, with only fruits and nuts for dinner. This is\nespecially beneficial for persons suffering with catarrh.\n\nFOR HEADACHES: Let sunlight fall freely on your head and face. Keep\neyes closed. Rub rapidly with your fingers the entire\nscalp, forehead, back part of head, and the sides of head. As you rub,\nthink that you are mixing with the sunlight the life force flowing\nthrough your fingers, and that you are pouring this mixed solution of\nhealing light on your head and saturating the pores with it. Do this\nfor ten minutes and you will realize the great power of this exercise.\n\nYOGIC EYE EXERCISE: The light from the sun has in it great healing\n\nrays, and also very destructive rays. To look at\nthe sun at noon may blind you, because at that hour the actinic and\nother destructive rays overbalance the healing rays. The yogis advise\nthat under no circumstances should one look at the sun except during the\nfirst hour after sunrise and the hour before sunset.\n\nEarly in the morning, during the first hour after sunrise, and early @\nin the evening, during the last hour before sunset, the destructive rays\nof the sun are filtered out by the earth’s atmosphere, and the healing\nrays pass through. One may then safely practice the following eye\nexercise taught by the yogis of India.\n\nStare into the sun with the eyes open and unwinking as long as you\ncan without discomfort. Practice this a half minute to a minute at\nfirst, gradually increasing the time to not more than nine minutes.\n\nAfter staring at the sun with wide open eyes as directed above,\nblink the eyes rapidly for one full minute.\n\nClose eyes and turn your back to the sun.\n\nPut the right hand over the eyes and the left hand over the right\nhand. You will see the image of the sun, which is still retained on the\nretina of the eye. Concentrate upon that image and visualize all the\nhealing rays of the sun coming into your eyes through that sun which you\nsee with closed eyes. That is actually what happens.\n\nKeep the hands over the eyes. When the image of the sun begins to\nfade, move the eyeballs up, to the right, down, to the left, and so on,\nrepeating this rotation with a little tension, and visualizing energy\nfrom the sun flowing into the eyes and strengthening them. @\n\n"}

Become a true sun worshiper, loving\nthe Sun of Life within and outside your body.\n\nOne who follows the preceding instructions for the vitaheliotropic\nmethod of healing flushes his body pores with cheerful vitality from\nwithin, and with unobstructed sunlight from without. Such a vitalized\nman dwells in a temple of living energy, in which the powers of mind and\nwisdom love to come and remain.\n\nTHOUGHTS TO REMEMBER\n\nAlthough you should take care of the body and should follow the\nright laws of living, do not allow your efforts in this direction to\nbecome a preoccupation that consumes all your time. Do not make health\nthe ruling factor in your life. Healing the soul also heals both body\nand mind. When you have healed your soul of ignorance you have also\nhealed your mind and your body, for the darkness of mental inharmonies\nand physical disease can no longer exist when the light of wisdom enters\nyour body temple.\n\nkkk\nMEDITATION TECHNIQUE\n\nMeditate with closed eyes, beholding the darkness behind your\neyelids. Mentally say: \"I dissolve my body in darkness.\" Forget the\nbody, watching the limitless dark space of eternity spread above, be-\nneath, in front, behind, ahead, everywhere. Now visualize a sealed\nballoon of rainbow light surrounding you. Throw the breath out very\nSlowly, visualizing your breath as light that is filling and expanding\nthe balloon. Remember, this balloon of light cannot burst, no matter\nhow much you blow into it. Continue expanding the rainbow balloon of\nlight with your luminous breath until it becomes big enough to contain\nthe earth and your body; star clusters, universes, planetary and solar\nsystems -- everything.\n\neae MORAL BACKBONE\n\nLong ago, near a rock outside a village in India, there lived a\npoisonous, hooded snake. This reptile killed many of the village chil-\ndren with its death-dealing fangs, but he was so sly that every attempt\nof the villagers to kill him failed. As a last resort, the villagers\nvisited their holy man and entreated him: \"Holy Master, please use your\nspiritual powers to prevent the snake from continuing its gruesome work\nof murdering our little children.\"\n\nThe saint agreed to comply with their request. He went near the\n\n"}

Then the saint commanded: \"0 Snake,\ndesist from biting to death the dear people of my village. Practice\nnonviolence.\" With humbled hood the snake promised.\n\nSoon after this incident the saint went on a pilgrimage. It was a\nyear before he returned to the village, but as he passed by the rock\nwhere the snake lived he thought of the snake and wondered if it had\nkept its promise. As he looked about he was astonished to spy the snake\nin a pool of blood, severe wounds in its back.\n\nWhen the saint asked what was the matter with him, the snake in a\nfeeble voice replied: \"Holy Preceptor, I have seven wounds in my back as\na result of your teachings. Ever since the village children found out\nthat I was harmless, they have pelted me with stones whenever they saw\nme go out in search of food. Although I have ducked in and out of my\nhole as quickly as I could, I have received these seven injuries to my\nspine. Master, at first they fled at the sight of me, but now, because\nof your teachings of nonviolence, I have to flee from them.\"\n\nThe Hindu master patted the snake on the back and healed him. Then\nhe smilingly rebuked him, saying: \"You little fool, I did tell you not\nto bite; but why didn’t you hiss?\"\n\nRemember, when you are too much imposed upon by people who take\n© _ advantage of you, do not spinelessly permit them to hurt you; yet do not\n| । inject the poison of injury into them either.

For greatest success, the employer and the employee\nshould have one common goal--the real success of the business they have under-\ntaken together. Both are servants working for one cause.\n\nThe best way to please an employer is to be kind, obedient, and pleasant to\nhim, and to be better qualified for advancement than anyone else in his employ.\nIn this way it is sometimes possible for a person to work up to a high position\nin the business. He should not then relax on his laurels but continue to develop\nhis resourcefulness, so that the employer will feel that without him he would be\nvirtually blind. An employer may even give to such a valued worker a partner-\nship in the business. Meanwhile, be sure to keep your employer pleased by\nintelligent, productive, hard work; by exceptional pleasantness and courtesy;\nand if possible by doing whatever you can to help him with his responsibilities.\n\nYou can maintain a tolerant, unruffled attitude externally toward a cranky\nemployer by increasing your own kindness and courtesy and internally by ignor-\ning utterly his intolerant behavior. During meditation each day, while concen-\ntrating at the point between the eyebrows, broadcast a plea for God's help:\n\n\"Father, help my employer to become inwardly\nand outwardly calm and happy.

So\nno matter how small your duty is, perform it with the cheerful, careful attitude\nof doing it to please God. Anyone who works with the consciousness of perform-\ning all actions to please God, and who respects all the employers under whom he\nhas to work as agents of the Divine, can never fail, but will succeed in any direc-\ntion without limitation.\n\nDuring meditation, say:\n\n\"Father, bless me that I be able to offer the best service in the\nbusiness lamin.

To cultivate originality of\nthought, practice two precepts:\n\n1. Meditate deeply every day for at least half an hour.\n\n2. Put your entire mind and concentration upon finding out how you can\nimprove methods in your line of work and how you can make yourself\nfit for a better position of higher responsibility in your work.\n\nIf you find that you can make progress, or that there is a chance of promo-\ntion in the company you are working for, go on using your inventive and produc -\ntive skill for the advancement of your employer's business. However, if analysis\nshows that your function is only mechanical and has no potential for future devel-\nopment, consider your present work as temporary and make up your mind to\ndevelop your aptitudes in a type of business that is suited to your abilities and\nthat has a future. First make sure that you can secure a position in the business\nyou like; then leave your present unsatisfactory position.\n\nIf you develop creative concentration, you can learn to enjoy any kind of\nwork; you can develop efficiency and progress in any direction you choose. It\nis better, however, to try to use your creative ability in work to which you are\ninstinctively attracted because of prenatal tendencies, rather than in work for\nwhich you have to awaken your interest anew.\n\nIf you don't like being obliged to please an employer and if you cannot endure\nsubordination, you should learn everything necessary to become your own employ-\ner. Acquire complete knowledge and experience in one branch of an essential\nbusiness; then direct your attention to gathering funds--by extra work, and by\nprudent borrowing, if necessary. Lead a plain life and be prepared to sacrifice\nsome of your lesser desires to achieve your goal.\n\nCongenital defects 019 nonproductive, nonintelligent mind may be removed\nonly by meditation and constructive thinking. Communion with God can remove\nall human limitations that impede success. Learn to receive success vibrations\nintuitively from God during meditation, and from mixing with successful men\nand associating with successful business firms when you are busy with worldly\naffairs.\n\nThe use of your soul's unlimited resourcefulness will lead you to the sphere\nof unlimited success. By daily thinking about your line of work and the business\nyou are in, and by practical training and experience acquired in school or ina\npractical occupation, you will find your proficiency in your chosen profession\nincreasing in manifold ways.\n\nगमैः\n\n"}

His dogmatic attitude had been instilled in him by his teacher,\nto whose grace he ascribed all his fortune. He had vowed to train his own dis-\nciples as he had been trained, with unreasonable, dogmatic discipline.\n\nEvery day he harangued the members of his temple with insistent instructions\nto be implicitly obedient to him. With flagrant imagination he pictured for them\nthe fires of Hades that would consume all dissenters and spiritual rebels. Being\nan ignorant man, he did not like to be questioned about his beliefs and his state-\nments, particularly by men of intelligence. Before the flame of their bright\nminds he-could-feel his dogmatic assertions meiting like butter> > |\n\nNevertheless he somehow managed to hold a crowd of followers, chiefly by\nthe lavish distribution of sweetmeats, which helped some of the more knowledge-\nable members of his congregation to stomach his oratory. For the most part the\ngroup consisted of illiterates with dogma-hardened mentalities. They always\nagreed with the priest and were ever ready to pelt stones of scripture at anyone\nwho questioned the wisdom of their priest. He was really the proud leader ofa\nband of idiots who did nothing but agree with him.\n\nOne day his students asked: ''Honored priest, will you please show us the\ntrue way to pray and the absolutely certain method of contacting God?\" The\npriest, sure of no intelligent scrutiny from his blind, unquestioning followers,\nreplied: ''My loyal children, that is easy. Ican teach you, provided you do\nexactly as Ido after I start the lesson.\"\n\n\"Heaven bless our great teacher-priest!'' shouted his followers. ''We\nsolemnly swear to do exactly as you do until doomsday if you will only teach us.\nSo the priest beckoned and said: 1411 right, my children, follow me to the\ntemple and sit around me and after that do exactly as Ido. '' The priest sat on\n\n11\n\na cushion in the middle of the temple, which was half-lighted by the morning sun.\nThe students, drenched with devotion, sat around him, all ready to follow what-\never the master-priest would do.\n\n"}

'' Two hundred devout followers\nimmediately chorused: ‘Sit upright. '' At this unexpected answer the priest\nlooked around, and the disciples, seeing the master look around, also looked\naround. In disgust, the priest closed his eyes and prayed: ''O Spirit, benign\nLord.'' The disciples at once prayed: \"0 Spirit, benign Lord.\"\n\nThe priest continued: ''Benign Lord of the Universe, bless us with the knowl-\nedge that will make us obey our master implicitly. '' The students devoutly\nrepeated these words in unison. Just then the priest became aware of a little\ndraft coming through a temple window and began to feel an uncontrollable tickling\nin his throat. Before he could utter more words of prayer he coughed. The dis-\nciples coughed too. The master was dismayed at this absurd antic, resulting\nof course from his own training; but alas, as he coughed and sneezed again, all\nhis disciples coughed and sneezed too. Now the priest was angry. \"Quiet, you\nfools! Don't cough, and don't imitate me.'’ But his well-trained disciples happi-\nly shouted back: \"Quiet, you fools! Don't cough, and don't imitate me. ''\n\nThis was too much. The priest stood up and commanded: ''This lunacy must\nstop!'' And the matchless disciples, the best products of his training, stood up\nand demanded: ''This lunacy must stop!\"'\n\nThe priest forgot the dignity of his position and forcefully swung his palm\nwith a resounding slap on the cheek of one of his thoughtless group. Two hundred\ndisciples at once followed suit, slapping one another, and their master, until\ntheir cheeks grew hot and fiery red. His face burning with countless slaps, the\npriest rushed out of the temple crying, ''Water! Water!'' And of course the\ndisciples followed him shouting, ''Water! Water!'' and slapping one another all\nthe while.\n\nThe priest, being able to think of no other way of escape, jumped into a well\nto cool his burning cheeks. You can guess what happened then! His two hundred\ndogma-drugged disciples jumped into the well on top of him. The priest had\ntruly kept his promise, for they all ''went to heaven\" together.

Be satisfied and find God. After all, even the millionaire\nhas to leave everything behind. Why shouldn't you feel that God is waiting for\nyou? You have run away from your home. Reverse your consciousness from\nbeing a prodigal son to being a real son of God.\n\nKH\nEXPLANATION OF THE STORY\n\"THE PRIEST WHO JUMPED INTO THE WELL\"\nThe story in Lesson 40 shows that theology-stuffed dogmatists who follow\nuntested beliefs will ultimately, like the blind following the blind, be drowned\n\nin the same pit of ignorance. Ignorant students should not cling to ignorant\nspiritual teachers, for they drag each other down, to sink in ignorance.\n\nYou do not help yourself to grow spiritually when you blindly follow a\nreligion just because your forefathers followed it. To join a neighborhood\nchurch just because it is conveniently near, or to change your religion when-\never you change your residence, also shows failure to exercise one's powers\nof discrimination and free choice.\n\nMost people do unthinkingly whatever they are told to do by their church.\nOnly the searching few try to understand why they should pray, and what is the\nmeaning of prayer, and why prayer seems to be a one-sided affair. Do you\nknow why, when you have prayed continuously without receiving any response,\nyour prayers are not answered? Are you going to permit yourself to drown\nin a well of unhappiness, burning with the slaps of experiences arising from\nyour own spiritual ignorance and the scorching mistaken ideas introduced into\nyour mind by others lacking in spiritual wisdom? Search until you find true\nwisdom!\n\nUnderstand the influence of the imitative subconscious mind that tortures\nman with so many bad habits. Subconscious habits, like the two hundred idiots\nin the story, blindly imitate the priest of one's wrong judgment. If by mistake\nyou choose a wrong action, your invisible subconscious mind imitates the\nwrong action chosen by the conscious mind and keeps on suggesting that you\nrepeat it until the wrong action grows into a bad habit. Your subconscious\nmind is the blind imitator of your conscious mind. If your conscious mind\nbecomes dogmatic and unreasonable like the priest in the story, then your sub-\nconscious mind will do likewise.\n\n"}

If the priest in the story had been a wise man, he\nwould not have attracted ignorant, mimicking disciples, nor would he have\nexpired so ignominiously! A wise conscious mind builds a wise subconscious\nmind. The subconscious mind endowed with wisdom in turn strengthens an\nalready wise conscious mind.\n\nOur story especially illustrates that one should be constantly watchful in\ntraining his conscious mind, for the subconscious imitator within is always\nready to form either strong good or strong bad habits through the medium of\nthe conscious mind, and to turn back then and influence it with good or bad\nhabits. The subconscious mind is the automatic mind that repeats our acquired\nconscious experiences lest we forget them. Without it we would have to start\n\n‘out every day like babies. And yet the subconscious memory-mind may be\n\nyour worst enemy, for it will stimulate your conscious mind to repeat, parrot-\nlike, against your will, your worst habits. Good habits ensure easy perform-\nance of good actions, while bad habits compel you to do evil against your will.\nSo be careful what you choose to do consciously, for unless your will is very\nstrong, that is what you may have to do repeatedly and compellingly through\nthe habit-influencing power of the subconscious mind.\n\nHK\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nI will help myself that I may bring into\nproper use all my God-given powers.\n"}

A person\nborn good in this life was a good person in his previous incarnation; and if he\ncontinues to behave rightly, he will attract to his nature more good qualities.\nThose who have very few good tendencies may lose even those they have by\nthe invasion of powerful bad tendencies. If a person is inclined to be bad, it\nis an indication he has had bad tendencies before, and that he may attract ह\nmore similar tendencies. Those who are only slightly inclined to wrong | ।\nactions were so inclined before, but the preponderance of good qualities also\nacquired from past incarnations will usually crowd out whatever meager\nwrong tendencies that person has brought with him into this life.\n\nThis is the natural working of the law of cause and effect, or karma. How-\never, one should not feel helplessly bound by them if he happens to have unde-\nsirable habits and wishes to be rid of them. Now is the time to begin conquer-\ning them through the development of will power and the habit of regular, right\nmeditation. It is possible to free oneself from the clutches of wrong habits\nand to create right habits of thought and action that will bring the desired\nresults.\n\nNo matter how strong one's evil habits may be, he should remember it is\nby his own consciousness, through repetition of a thought, and of a thought-\nproducing action, that he has formed a specific habit. If the consciousness\ncan think itself into bad habits, it has only to think differently to cultivate good\nhabits. Good and bad ideas are different forms, or different dreams, of con-\nsciousness. It is better to dream beautiful phases of consciousness than to\nhave nightmares of a wrongly imaginative consciousness. Consciousness is\nvery imaginative and sensitive. It is pliable and can think ordream itself\ninto any state.\n\nThe trouble with most people is that they voluntarily allow their kingdom @\n\n"}

At such times one should summon his discrimina- =\n\n5-2 72-42 3\n\nof consciousness to be ruled by wrong tendencies born of past habits. Their\ngood discriminative tendencies, also born of past habits, remain ostracized;\nand the occult soul soldiers, the metaphysical rear guards hidden behind the\narmies of discrimination, remain inactive, too.\n\nAVOID WEAK AND People ruled by evil habits hate the light of truth, but\nEVIL ACTIONS this is true only as long as they are intoxicated with\n\nevil thoughts and ways. When they have had enough of\nunsatisfying wrong living, and have suffered long enough from its consequences,\nthey turn to the light of understanding and right living for relief. They seek\nthe light of God, even though formidable bad habits still stand in their way.\nThen, if they develop good habits by practicing harmonious ways of living,\nthey come again to understand the luminous joy of inner peace and self-\ncontrol brought by good habits.\n\nRemember that it requires only the repetition of a few weak actions to\nproduce habits of weakness. Habits are automatic, psychological machines\nthat help us to perform necessary actions easily. Most people allow their\nself-created habits of weakness or failure to enslave them. One may save\nhimself if he has made up his mind to live differently, but his resolution to\nfight bad habits must then persist until success is reached.\n\nMaterial desires encourage our bad habits by engendering false hopes of\n\ntive powers to reveal the truth: bad habits lead ultimately to unhappiness.\nThus exposed, bad habits become impotent to hold man in their misery-making\nsway. When the mind is convinced by discrimination of the worthlessness of\nbad habits, they cease to exist.\n\nIt is important that one's freedom of action be insured. Most people live\nall through life simply making good resolutions without accomplishing any of\nthem. Such persons are actually sliding down the hill of progress while they\ndream they are clinybing up. Those who have thus weakened their wills find\nthat the more they struggle for success, the deeper they sink into the quick-\nsand of failure. Or they may fall into the pit of despair before they realize\nwhat is happening to them.\n\nA man rolling downhill finds no resistance, but as soon as he tries to\nclimb up he meets great resistance. So it is with the man who is fast sliding\ninto habitual thoughts and actions; he does not find resistance until he tries to\nreverse his direction and climb the hill of virtue.\n\nThe more one improves himself, the more he will elevate others around\nhim. The self-improving man is the increasingly happy man. The happier\nhe becomes, the happier will be the people around him.\n\nSEEK GOOD COMPANY _ Evil tendencies from prenatal existence and bad\n\n"}

Prenatal influences must be outgrown, but bad company may be\n\navoided. A number of evil people assembled together quickly influence--con-\nsciously or unconsciously--the will of a new arrival. A company of people,\n\nthe majority of whom are evil, will have a bad influence over an undisciplined\n\nchild living with them. Conversely, one who lives among good people who\n\nhave an inner desire to be even better will himself automatically tend to be\n\ngood. Repeated good or bad actions produce good or bad habits that impel\n\none gladly to become good or evil.\n\nBecause evil appears to promise great happiness, most people are at\nfirst attracted by the extra gloss of the spurious coin of mundane sense lures.\nThoughts of dishonesty, temptation, or revengefulness that may come to\nmind are dark soldiers of the misery-making senses. They want to conquer\nthe kingdom of happiness within and to keep you prisoner in the dungeon of\nunhappiness and misery. As soon as the soldiers of wrong thoughts rally\ntogether to attack your inner peace, wake up your soul soldiers of light, hon-\nesty, self-control, and desire for good things, and wage a furious battle.\n\nThe golden luster of the soul's potential lasting happiness becomes\nobscured by encrustations of temporary sense pleasures. A man whose mind\nis attentive also to jealousy, worry, and so forth becomes thoroughly misera-\nble; but when he turns the same concentration of attention to thoughts and acts ©\nof love, peace, and harmony, he feels supremely happy. So the soul also\nregains its happiness when it turns from indulgence in spurious misery-\nmaking sense pleasures to delight in its own superior pleasure-producing\nsoul qualities.\n\nMany good people have allowed their soul happiness to perish by not heed-\ning the stern behests of wisdom, yielding instead to the sweet but poisonous\nwords of wicked associates. It would be better to live in Hades with one\nharsh-speaking wise man than to live in Heaven with ten sweet-mouthed poi-\nsonous beings. The latter would make Hades of Heaven, whereas justly-\nspeaking wise friends would make Heaven of Hades.\n\nThere would be much less hypocrisy in the world if children, instead of\nbeing constantly scolded for their errors, were taught positive moral reme-\ndies such as methods of self-control, right living, and proper hygiene before\nthey have a chance to become victims of evil through bad company.\n\nOne should make himself adamant against taking offense and freely \"for-\ngive and forget\" the offenses of those who wrong him. One should never\nbecome angry, nor allow oneself to become the victim of another's anger.\nHe who is wise does his best to overcome difficulties; but he smiles, first, @\nlast, and allthe time.

The master and his disciples के\nhabitually woke with the dawn, and spread their prayers over the Divine Bosom\n\nwith the scattering sunrays. They subsisted on jungle fruits and roots and\n\nslept in nature-hewn caves on the lower spur of the forested hills.\n\nOne disciple, Rama, had specially renounced the sophisticated environ-\nment of his luxurious parental home, and had joined this jungle hermitage in\norder to live its very simple life. Rama had an over-critical, metaphysical-\nly meticulous spirit. As time went by, he started finding fault even with the\nhomely disciplinary duties of the hermitage. Rama had been warned not to go\nto extremes, but one day he said to his master, ‘Honored Sir, I find I have\nleft one family only to get into another larger one here. I used to perform\nduties at home, and here I have todo the same. At home we were fond of one\nanother, we ate, we worried about food and cleanliness, dreamed and slept,\nand I see that we do these things here also. Master, Iam fed up with the\nmaterial duties of your hermitage, which are nothing but substitutes for the\nworldly duties I performed at home. I want to get away from all materiality\nand live in remote solitude in the temple of contemplation. 11\n\nThe master answered warningly: 11507, you may go, but beware that you\ndon't get enmeshed in delusion by living only in the company of your own erron-\neous thoughts. Though you escape the association with good people, who are\nafter all better than worldly people, it will be most difficult for you to fly\nfrom the mad concourse of your own restless thoughts, which may lead you @\nastray. 11\n\nRama paid no heed to the warnings of the master and the entreaties of his\nfellow disciples. He sallied forth in search of a solitary spot. To be free\nfrom all encumbrances, he left all the simple belongings of his hermitage life\nand took only two pieces of rag to serve as loincloths, and a begging bowl for\nwater. At last he found a very quiet place on the top of a hill at the outskirts\nof the jungle and near a village. He lived ona rocky ledge under a huge shady\ntree.\n\nThe first night passed in peace, even though he was lulled to sleep by the\nhowling of the jackals, coyotes, and jungle tigers. But when dawn came the\nyoung anchorite Rama was dismayed to see that a little mouse had eaten small\nholes in the second piece of rag which he had hung on the tree branch above\nhim. And his begging bowl had been stolen by a silent nocturnal thief--a mon-\nkey. Rama thought: Heavenly Father, I left all for You and now You have\ntaken my bowl and sent a mouse to nibble on my very last possession--the\npiece of rag.\"\n\nJust at this time a villager was passing by the rock, and, having caught\na glimpse of the saint, halted to pay him respect.

Another kindly villager supplied him with a new begging bowl.\n\nThe next day Rama added to his possessions a silky Persian cat. And so\nthe problem of the rag was solved, for the mice knew better than to hazard\nmeeting the feline god of death just for a tiny tidbit of adry rag. Every day\nRama went to the village to fetch some milk for his cat.\n\nA year went by and the villagers ungrudgingly supplied free milk for the\nsaint and his cat, until one day the village elder said to the saint as he begged\nmilk from him: \"Holy Rama, we are tired of supplying you with milk.\"' ''But\nhow is my cat going to live?'' retorted Rama. ''Why don't you keep a cow?\"\nsuggested the village headman.\n\n\"How can I get one?'' queried Rama. \"I will give you one right now, ' the\nvillage elder generously offered. Rama joyfully returned to his rustic home\nwith a cow.\n\nNow Rama, his cat, and the cow formed a pleasant family, cheering one\nanother in a mutual language of affection. The cow was knownas \"'the saint's\ncow.'' It was not, however, a saintly cow; it acted more like a freebooter,\n\n“marauding the paddy fields of the villagers.\n\nAnother year passed, and many were the anguished tales of wholesale\nmunching of paddy fields by the much-tolerated saint's cow. The tolerance\nand forgiveness of the villagers finally came to an end. One day they came in\na body tothe saint and complained about the ravages wrought by the audacious\nbovine. ''Well, how else am I going to feed my cow?'! asked Rama.\n\n\"Why don't you have your own land? We will give you twenty-five acres, ''\nthe villagers said in chorus. Saint Rama was delighted with this.

We should\ncorrectly gauge the measure of the adversary so as to be sure that we are\nexerting the amount of power required for successful combat. It is necessary\nto determine, through daily introspection, whether we are really free--to eat,\nwalk, move, work, and meditate, according to the dictates of will power and\nwisdom--or whether we are tools of bad habits that make us do miserable\nthings in spite of the protestations of our reason and will.\n\nTo yield to bad habits merely strengthens those bad habits and weakens\nthe will power. Fight anger, faultfinding, jealousy, fear, inertia, overeating\n(or whatever particular weakness one is trying to overcome) by not yielding @\nto temptation against one's discriminative judgment and will. Once we have\ndetermined to do something of value we should not waver, but should go through\nwith the idea to its completion. One increases his power of will over bad habits\nonly insofar as he follows the dictates of wisdom. Banish material failure,\nspiritual indifference, mental and moral weaknesses, and halfheartedness\nabout meditating, by using the will to become more prosperous and to become\nmore spiritual, by exercising self-control, and by meditating deeply until one\nactually contacts God.\n\nThe greater one's will power, the less enslaving will be the influence of\nbad habits. One who has acquired bad habits should make up his mind that he\nए ५ no longer going to be bound by them; he should resolve that henceforth he\nwill be the sole governor of his actions, using wisdom to guidehis power of\nfree choice. Conquer all undesirable habits, that you may live as a freeborn\ncitizen in God's kingdom of cosmic wisdom. To be able to live according to\nthe dictates of wisdom will give you much more happiness than you could ever\nattain by weakly remaining bound and limited by habits, no matter how harm-\nlessly pleasurable they may seem.\n\nMost people do not realize the extent of the consequences of bad habits\nand wrong thinking until they suffer excruciating bodily pain or undergo heart-\nbreaking sorrow.

A man who wakes up from\ndelusion and tries to become better, soon finds his evil habits clashing with\ndesire for self-control. Even if the soul wins this first psychological battle\nthrough discriminative self-control, it has then to go through another and\nmore subtle metaphysical battle: that between the soul's faculties of Self-\nrealization and its egoistic prenatal and postnatal bad habits.\n\nIt rests with the individual whether he will allow greed, sense slavery,\nanger, hatred, revengefulness, worries, and other inharmonies to rule his\nlife; or whether he will employ the divine soldiers of self-control, calmness,\nlove, forgiveness, peace, and harmony to rule his mental kingdom.\n\n` -` Jesus pointed ott a universal psychological error in the reasoning of €~\nsons who are enslaved by wrong habits when he said: ''And this is the condem-\nnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than\nlight, because their deeds were evil.

Just as\nthe owl thrives in darkness and shuns the daylight, so do people cling to bad\nhabits and shun better ways of living. They do not want to think of the greater\ncomfort of mind and body that comes with the practice of good habits, because\nthey fear that in giving up the temporary pleasures of the flesh they will suffer.\n\nWhen the experience of bad habits precedes knowledge of the joy to be had\nin good habits, the ego is so influenced as to prefer \"darkness, '' 1. €. , the\ndiscomfort accruing from continued bad habits, to the yield or harvest of\nmental and physical comfort emanating from good habits.

Spiritual\n\nignorance and continuous bodily pain are both evil in relation to man because\n\ntheir presence keeps man from realizing the goodness of God and of his own\n\nsoul.\n\nPersons who drink find it pleasurable only because they do not know the\ntaste of the superior wine of soul joy found in the bottle of meditation, which\ncould make them forget all their worries. One should not be one-sided,\nadopting only easily acquired bad habits. The cultivation of good habits and\nthe experience of their superior joy-yielding quality gives proper basis of\ncomparison. Without such a comparison upon which to base actions initiated\nby free choice, one may easily be tempted by delusive sense attractions to\nbecome enslaved by bad habits.\n\nSENSE PLEASURES The devotee may wonder why he should follow austere\nOR SOUL JOY laws of self-control and live in seeming emptiness\nwithout the instantaneously available comforts of the\npleasure-yielding senses. He fails to use his imagination to picture the last-\ning joys of the soul, which are hard to attain when one's attention is saturated\nwith sensory experiences. He thinks: ''Well, soul joy is a matter of future\nspeculation; I would be foolish to give up the present tangible pleasures of\nthe senses. My life would be sunk in the sin of constant misery if I were to\nforgo my God-given sense pleasures, which are so easily available now. ''\n\nSuch persons do not realize that indulgence in these sense pleasures cre-\nates insatiable, unsatisfiable, burning desires for more sense experiences,\nwithout ever quenching the inner thirst. In this respect pleasure is like salt\nwater: instead of quenching thirst, it creates greater thirst. Though difficult\nto attain, soul joy once gained may never be lost; it never ends in satiety but\nyields unending, ever new joy.\n\nTrue devotees should resist any feeling of inner loneliness that may come\nas they picture the deserted battlefield of the mind, full of the corpses of wis-\ndom-slain material desires. They should think of the slain habitual material\ndesires rather as enemies in disguise who promised happiness when they\nmeant to give only worries, insatiable hungers, broken hopes, disillusion-\nments, and death. Inimical material pleasures resent the advent of lasting\ndivine happiness and struggle to retain their hold on the devotee. He should\nremain firm in his knowledge that, although in the beginning it is hard to give\nup the happiness of material and sensory pleasures, such renunciation is the\nonly hope of gaining permanent spiritual blessedness. He will be amply repaid\nwhen he actually experiences the superior, lasting, ever new joy of inner soul | ।\nperception.\n"}

Let this thought fortify you ina\nstronger effort to contact God through deep meditation. Only thus may man\nreacquaint himself with the forgotten, deathless, indestructible, real soul\nthat is hidden behind the false-pleasure-infested, perishable, pretending-to-\nbe-his-own body.\n\nMEDITATION IS THE Jesus taught that the best method of killing bad\nWAY TO FREEDOM habits lies in the actual performance of God-awak-\nFROM TEMPTATION ening good habits of meditation. When the habit of\n\nattachment to dark delusion has settled in the ego,\nthe only way out lies in using the will power to meditate deeply, daily, until\nthe actual, all-alluring Bliss-contact of God is definitely achieved and can be\nreproduced in the consciousness at will.\n\nRestless people are unaware of the evil-resisting power of their discrim-\ninative tendencies and of the occult faculties of the superconscious mind.\nThose who are prisoners in the hands of restlessness, but who are trying by\nmeditation to calm themselves, will now and then become aware, however,\nthat these hidden occult sotdiers are trying to emerge from the supercon- = ` - -----\nsciousness to offer spiritual aid.\n\nIn the beginning, the spiritual aspirant finds that his soldiers of discrim-\nination are guided by the desire to be good. Later, as he meditates longer\nand prays ardently for inner help, he feels a calm conviction that intuition, or\nawakening inner light, a veteran occult general, is emerging from the super-\nconscious to guide his forces of discrimination. This awakening inner light\nis the offspring of good past habits.\n\nThe inner discrimination of the yogi sees how, by false hopes, material\ndesires reawaken the bad habits in man, though he knows they are misery-\nproducing. The devotee who has once felt the ever-charming soul force in\ndeep meditation can never forget the joy of it, even though he comes down\nfrom that state for a while.\n\nTHOUGHTS TO LIVE BY\n\nThe most effective way to overcome temptation is to compare it with the\njoy of meditation. Temptation does not mean just doing something wrong\nfrom the material standpoint; it also means forgetting your soul by becoming\ntoo engrossed in the body and its comforts.

'' This Lesson has to do with that phase of jealousy described as\n‘rivalry in matters of interest or affection. ''\n\nBEWARE OF One's individual happiness depends to a large extent\nFALSE JUDGMENT upon his protecting himself and others from the hurtful\n\nresults of gossip and jealousy. See no evil, speak no\nevil, hear no evil, think no evil, feel no evil. Most people can talk about\nother persons for hours; intoxicated with the wine of gossip, they never think\nof its poisonous effects. Is it not remarkable how some people can smoothly,\njoyously, for hours at a time make the most caustic criticisms about the\nfaults of others, but cannot themselves endure for a moment any reference\nto their own faults!\n\nOne should not indulge in shameful talk about the mental dirt in the lives\nof others, but rather get busy and free his own life from weaknesses and\nunlovely habits. It is necessary first to silently heal oneself of the desire to\ncriticize. Once we have freed ourselves from the tendency to condemn and\ngossip about others, we may teach others to be better by our sympathetic\nheart and good example.\n\nUnkind words can be ruthless destroyers of lifelong friendships and of\ndomestic harmony. We should banish unkind words from our lips forever,\nand make our home life safe from the invasion of sudden tempests of anger\nand other inharmonies. Sincere, sweet words are nectar to thirsty souls.\nKind words are in demand everywhere. They create happiness in enemies\nas well as friends, in societies, churches, business offices--everywhere.\nPeople are glad when a sweet-voiced sincere friend appears. They also feel\nhappy when a crabby person departs from their presence!\n\nWhen drunk with the excitement of anger, people are often emotional\nfirebugs. With the matches of wrathful words they set fire to the inner peace\nof others around them. Ill-spoken words, flaring up in a fit of emotion, con-\nflagrate the forest of friendship and burn up all the little green plants of\ncourteous dealings and sympathetic thoughts.\n\n"}

Once we have made up our minds to change we\n\nshould start by speaking sincere, kind words to those to\nwhom we may have been unjustly harsh. We should make ourselves attractive\nby wearing the fine garment of genuinely courteous language. We should first\nof all be courteous to our immediate relatives. When one can do that, he will\nbe habitually kind to all people. Real family happiness has its foundation on\nthe altar of understanding and kind words. It is not necessary to agree on\neverything in order to show kindness. Calm silence, sincerity, and courte-\nous words, whether one is agreeing or disagreeing with others, mark the per-\nson who knows how to behave.\n\nOur intimate friends do not criticize us openly for fear of offending us;\nbut they criticize us inwardly, as we do them. He who wants to know what his\nfriends think about him should behave himself perfectly and keep constantly\nimproving himself by being unselfish, wise, calm, meditative, fearless,\nsweet, sincere, courteous, methodical, true to his word, unafraid to be firm\nand just; thus his friends will be so overwhelmed by his goodness that they\nwill not only think lovingly of him, but they will also talk freely about his lov-\nable qualities.\n\nThe man who learns to make himself behave and be happy will influence\n-all the people he-meets'to be welt=behaved and happy also. Ican never suffi-\nciently thank my guru Sri Yukteswarji for his training. He frequently cau-\ntioned me: ''Learn to behave.'' I used to resent corrections extremely, for,\nlike a good many people, I had not thought any further improvement necessary.\nWhenever anyone did criticize me, I would laugh and try to argue that he was\nwrong about me.\n\nHowever, as I grew in wisdom, I began to see myself in the mental mir-\nrors of others' thoughts about me. I found that in them--and especially in the\nclear mirror of my Master's unprejudiced mind - -1 could see myself better\nthan I could in the little mirror of my own hazy understanding. I began to\nassociate then with persons of calm mind and to ask them how I appeared from\ntheir mental perceptions; for I had found out that there was a difference between\nwhat I thought others thought of me and what others actually thought of me in\ntheir inner minds.\n\nJEALOUSY IN Jealousy in married life is extremely pernicious.

To be reasonably jealous in order to guard\na loved one from falling into the trap of a designing person is all right; but\nwhen jealousy makes one lose his temper and behave like a human beast, an\noverconfident demon that thinks he has a permanent trade-mark on another\nperson forever, he should abhor the influence of the psychological Satan.\n\nA woman who feels jealous because her mate tends occasionally to browse\ninto the pastures of others' affections should give a hint of warning.

If that wife still\nthinks that her husband is a worthy peg on which to hang her life, she should\nnot be jealous or demanding, but rather put on the best clothes of sweet behav-\nior. She should be extra nice, extra cheerful, extra forgiving, extra lenient,\nextra magnetic toward him. She should express the peaceful attitude brought\nfrom meditation. She should not use physical force to draw the straying atten-\ntion of her mate, but rather the superior spiritual force of offering more love.\n\nEven if that love is rejected, she should not be unladylike. It is better to\nkill such a man with kindness; let him leave (if it must come to that) in kind-\nness, ever regretting that he left, rather than force him to jump out of one's\nnagging, jealous presence as if from a person stricken with a mortal plague.\nCouples who once thought that they loved each other should never mock their\nfeeling by allowing jealousy to instigate in them a feeling of hatred.

According to the then-prevailing custom,\na calf was killed especially for entertaining the saint. In these ancient times,\n\n~the Hindu householders used to-eat beef or veal, and they used to serve veal,\n\nespecially to distinguished guests. Later, beef and veal eating was condemned\nbecause of the thought that the cow played the part of mother to orphans by sup-\nplying them with milk, and because beef and veal eating was found to disturb\nthe astral and spiritual vibrations of the human body.\n\nWhile Saint Sananda accepted a veal dinner, he strictly prohibited his\ndisciples from eating any meat. He explained that they were under training,\nlearning how to control their passions and appetites, and should subsist only\non fruits, herbs, and vegetables. He maintained that meat-eating was not\ngood for the morally uncontrolled and mentally weak individual, whereas a\nvegetable diet has a calming effect upon uncontrolled, emotionally disposed\nnovitiates.\n\nSaint Sananda ate a hearty veal dinner and took a second helping in the\npresence of some of his disgruntled, greedy disciples. Dinner over, the\nsaint ordered the disciples to take up their little bundles, which were fastened\non small bamboo sticks and carried over their shoulders, and proceed ona\nmarch of fifty miles. After the tedious march started, the master was\nalways ahead, and kept turning to the lagging disciples, urging them to walk\ncheerfully and with speed, because he wanted to reach the next village before\nnightfall.

He turned abrupt-\nly and walked back to Markat, and in front of all the disciples he casually said:\n'Dear Markat, would you like to eat what I eat? Can you digest what I eat?\"\nDisciple Markat, thinking that the Master was going to offer him veal cutlets,\nemphatically said with assurance: ''Honored Sir, just try your food on me\nand see how fast I can melt it with my digestive fire. ''\n\nWhen Sananda and his disciples reached the end of their long journey,\nthey were told to tarry a little while around a huge fiery furnace where a\nsmith was preparing and cutting red hot nails. On the other side a big calf\nwas being roasted. The master, being welcomed by the blacksmith, said:\n\"Well, children, sit around this fire before entering the village, for lam\ngoing to offer you some very vitalizing food which'l have prevented you from\neating for along time. But before I invite you all to eat, I want Markat to\ncome and sit by me, for he has assured me that he will eat and digest what\nI eat.

Sananda at once put his hand into\nthe pile of red hot embers and nails and began to swallow them as fast as he\ncould, as if he were eating chopped veal. While the Saint was eating these\nfiery nails and embers calmly, he smilingly but forcefully said to his disciple\nMarkat: ''Come on, keep your promise and eat what I eat, and then we will\nsee whether you can digest it or not.'' Markat, highly ashamed, hid his face\nand fell at the feet of his master, sincerely asking forgiveness.\n\nThis story illustrates the importance of a disciple following with faith\nthe discipline enjoined upon him by a true master. Doubting the motives of\na true master only retards progress in the disciple. Mechanical or willing\nobedience to the spiritually blind teacher is of little value, for it makes an\nautomaton of an ignorant disciple, but willing obedience to the wisdom-\nguided will of a guru leads to freedom. @\n\naE\n"}

In order to live\nin friendship and harmony, husbands and wives must be of spiritual service\nto each other. Those 'newlyweds'' who forget that true (i.e., spiritual) love\nis based upon unselfish mutual service and friendship soon come to a parting\nof the ways. hen two souls are ideally mated, they spiritualize their love,\nso that after death their love is registered in eternity as the one love of God.\n\nLove will win where jealousy will surely fail. If love cannot be the sav-\nior of a wrecked marriage relationship, it is folly to bring in the demon of\njealousy, which might ruin both partners. If a wife ''goes wrong, '' and her\nhusband bids her good-by in sincere love, with an invitation to come back\nwhen she is able to be good, then perhaps only one soul will be lost. But if\nthe husband, in jealous rage, kills his unfaithful, erring wife, two souls will\nbe lost: she has already committed spiritual suicide, and he will go to the\nelectric chair for her murder. How foolishjealousy is! It kills the very\nthing it professes to love. Jealousy is self-love. If a man loves a woman\ntruly, he will not be able to bring himself to destroy her happiness and love\nfor him by taking her life and thus letting her go to the beyond filled with\nloathing for him that may last for incarnations.\n\nLove fosters trust.

At the call of dawn, the saint\nwould rouse his sleeping spirit and offer it to God. One morning, when the\ndewdrops were sobbing their dying farewell to the tender blades of grass, and\nthe saint was musing on the joy of his just-finished meditation, his attention\nwas slightly distracted by the sound of footsteps fast approaching him.\n\nThe saint was so calm that he did not even care to look around to ascer-\ntain the cause of the noise. However, in a few moments a man with an acute-\nly fear-distorted face halted for a moment in front of him, and in an implor-\ning voice said: ''Honored Saint, supreme lover of truth and truthful actions,\nplease do not tell my pursuing bandit enemies my hiding place in the tree\nabove you or they will kill me.\" Saying this, the much frightened man almost\nran up to the top of the tree and hid there within its kind sheltering leaves.\n\nThe saint remained silent, saying neither yea nor nay to the entreaty of\nthe frightened man; so the man naturally thought that silence meant consent,\nand that the virtuous man, knowing that betrayal might result in the stranger's\ndeath, would not betray him. However, as the man lay hidden high in the tree.\nthe saint began to struggle within himself as to what he could say to the man's\npursuers that would be in accordance with the advice of the scriptures, which\nhe followed very strictly and literally. Thus thinking to himself, he reasoned:\nthe scriptures say not to speak an untruth; so I could not say, if questioned by\nthe enemies of the pursued man, that Ido not know where he is. No, I would\nrather cut off my tongue than indulge in lies.\n\nThen he thought of the entreaty of the pursued man and the resulting mur-\nder if he spoke the truth. Puzzled as to how to choose between violating the\nscriptures by speaking an untruth, and the murderous result of speaking the\ntruth, the saint at last determined within himself: if the bandits question me\nabout seeing their prey, I shall say: ‘I know where he is but I will not tell\nyou.'’ Thinking this, the saint sat quietly, prepared to meet the difficult\npredicament.\n\nAt last the vicious bandit leader arrived with his retinue. Finding only\nthe saint in sight, he said gruffly: \"Hermit, I will not molest you if you will\ntell us whether you know the hiding place of the man we seek. '' The saint\n\n"}

But the plan did not work, for the bandit leader meant business\nand began to beat him. When the severe beating did no good, the bandit\nleader flashed his sword from its scabbard, brandished it before the saint\nand gave him five minutes to make up his mind if he would speak. The bandit\nswore that if he did not, the saintly body would sit forever still under the tree,\nwithout a head.\n\nA severe mental struggle ensued in the mind of the saint. When the time\nlimit expired, he replied cautiously: \"I know where your man is hiding but I\nwon't tell you. ! 1190 11 the bandit jeeringly replied, ''a beating and the flash-\ning of a sword has made you break your silence! Now behold what I shall do\nand you will tell the truth to me.\" So saying, the bandit cut off one of the\nsaint's hands and said tauntingly: \"I will give you five minutes more in which\nto tell the truth, or your head too will dance on the earth.\"\n\nThe saint began a mental search for scriptural injunctions that would\noffer a clue as to what he should do. He remembered one passage: ''Protect\nyour own self above all things, for that is most important. You must live,\nabove all, in order to achieve your highest ambition of finding God. If you\ndie for not telling the truth--when you should tell the truth--you are a fool. ''\nSo, at the end of the five minutes, when the bandit leader was about to chop\noff his head, the saint pointed a finger upward to show the bandit the hiding\n\nplace of the doomed fugitive.\n\nForthwith one of the bandits clambered up the tree, dragged the unfortu-\nnate man down, and hacked him to pieces limb by limb in front of the saint.\nWhile this man was being murdered, he shouted at the saint, ''You will see\nHades for this!'' However, the saint was not disturbed, thinking that he had\ndone his duty in saving the vehicle of his own more advanced (and therefore\nmore serviceable) soul rather than that of the less developed (and hence less\nuseful) soul of the pursued man. He rejected the curse of the dying man as\nfoolish and unlikely ever to happen to him who had followed only the truth.\n\n(To be continued)\nAFFIRMATION\nBless me, that I may find Thee in the temple of each thought\n\nand activity.

They have their affinities and\nUNIVERSAL they have their antipathies. If you bring into a magnet's\n\nfield of attraction some iron filings and chips of stone you\nwill see that the magnet attracts only the iron particles. It is evident that\nthere is a relation between the magnet and the type of objects it attracts. The\nmagnet's attraction does not affect stone. Apparently then there has to be\nsome likeness in the atomic structure of a magnet and the objects that are\ndrawn by it.\n\nWithin you that same magnetic force operates, although in a different way.\n\nYou attract living objects that have a relation to your magnetic power. A\nhuman being cannot attract a stone or a building because a stone has no rela-\ntion to himself, but he may try to find some individual whose appearance and\nqualities he has built up in his mind in the form of a mental picture. He may\nsay to himself, ''Sometime I will meet that person, '' and often, owing to this\nattractive power, he does meet that individual. Such cases show that undoubt-\nedly some force was working in the ether that brought about the meeting of\ntwo souls who might otherwise have been kept apart by the sheer mass of the\nworld's several hundred million people. How is it that two people (separated\nby the mass of humanity as well as by time and distance) are brought together,\nif there is not an invisible affinity, broadcasting from their hearts, to draw\nthem nearer to each other? When the broadcasting range of the hearts\nbecomes sufficiently powerful, they will meet.\n\nTYPES OF We can learn from the ordinary magnet that every kind of mag-\nMAGNETS net attracts according to the range of its power. Small magnets\n\ndraw small things. Stronger magnets draw bigger objects. So\nthe human magnet draws according to its power of attraction. And there are\nalso various kinds of human magnets in the world. Some attract physical\nthings and some attract mental power. Some attract spiritual qualities--those\nsubtle qualities which are so often hidden and forgotten.\n\nNow the first question is, what kind of a magnet do you want to be? A\nmaterial or a business magnet or a spiritual magnet? Which is best? Then\n\n"}

On the other hand, you cannot be completely spiritual\nuntil you have developed so much that you have outgrown all the necessities\nof material life. You cannot at this moment say, \"I will forget the body and\nits needs and concentrate only on attracting spiritual blessings.'' Only an\nadvanced yogi or a saint can dothat. I shall tell you about one such devotee.\n\nHOW A YOGI There was a certain Tibetan yogi who spent his entire\nHAD BREAKFAST ` time in realizing God. He lived in the jungle, where\n\nhis only subsistence was fruits or leaves or grasses,\nwhich he took wherever he found them. He had tremendous powers. One day\na man who was seeking God happened to be attracted there. He passed the\nnight with this renunciant. The next morning the yogi said, ''Let us have\nbreakfast. '' He put some water in a crude pot and boiled some leaves. But\nthe visitor was used to a luxurious way of life and so he anxiously asked, ''Is\nthat all you eat?'' The yogi replied, ''Yes.'' After a few minutes the man\nsaid dubiously, 'But I like real food.\"\n\nThe yogi offered, ''I will show you how to garnish this food. '' So he took\na little bit of the leaf and said, ''This is the salt.'' Then he took another piece\nof leaf and said, ''This is the curry powder you like so much. And this is the\nbutter you always add. Now--this soup has all the flavor whichI gave it. You\nwon't be able to taste it, but I will be able to do so, because I have so directed\n\nmy minds4\" ~~ ee ----- teres ~ - ~ ~ गाए\n\nLIMITED POWERS OF THE This yogi had reduced his life to utter simplicity\nMATERIAL MAGNET so that he could concentrate on being a spiritual\nmagnet; but because you have accustomed your-\nself to small material necessities you think you have to attract them. The\nway of wisdom is to simplify your needs. Develop enough material magnetism\nto supply your necessities, but spend most of your effort in acquiring spiritual\nmagnetism--for what is acquired by the lesser forms of magnetism is perish-\nable.\n\nIf you exert all your effort to gain material magnetism you will find at the\nend of your life that you have wasted your time. Childish desires belong to\nthe earth. Why should you cater to them? If you have actual needs try to fill\nthem and take adequate care of the body, but don't waste your time attracting\nuseless material things.\n\nThink of the funny things that you wanted when you were a little child. Per-\nhaps you wanted a doll, or yearned for a wagon, and so on. Now those desires\nseem ridiculous to you, but at that time a doll or a wagon was the greatest\ndesire in your life. You can't reawaken that desire in yourself now. Many of\nthe desires you are harboring in your brain at this moment are just as childish.\nYou will outgrow some of them during this life; and if you ever visit the king-\ndom of wisdom in this incarnation all your present desires will suddenly seem\nchildish.\n\n"}

Observe those । ।\npersons who have them, and see if they are happy. You will find that they are\n\nnot satisfied. They are looking for something else. I didn't waste my mag-\n\nnetism for long in acquiring material things. 1 used my magnetism to attract\n\nthe imperishable--the Infinite.\n\nAfter attracting God, you will never desire to exert your magnetism for\nany other attraction: having Him, you shall have everything. Most people\ndon't realize this. It is a fact that if you once find the imperishable God all\ndesires for perishable things will certainly be satisfied. In differentiating\nbetween what is perishable and what is imperishable, you should consider that\nanything that belongs to the body is perishable; and anything belonging to the\nsoul 15 imperishable. Learn to boil down your desires until only desires for\nnecessities are left.\n\nMoney does not always indicate good taste. A lot of people who have\nmoney buy so many things that they make junk houses of their homes. It\nrequires good taste and not necessarily a lot of money to make a home attrac-\ntive. But the trouble with even this idea is that some people become so pre-\noccupied with making the home appealing and attractive that they lose the\nchance to rise above material things. I would not be able to see now how easi-\nly one can become deluded if it were not for my training in India. I know that\neach one of you who has to pay the bills prays for the freedom that India teach- | ।\nes. But that freedom will never result if you are given to laziness; nor may\nyou gain it even by giving up everything. There was a man who said, ''Oh, I\nlost my wealth, and 1 lost my wife, so I forsook everything and became a monk.\"\nHe didn't forsake anything. Everything forsook him!\n\nWhen, through wisdom, you can eliminate unnecessary desires, other\npeople will envy you. Mental environment and the feeling of conviction you\nhave are very important. After you have boiled down your wants you might\nsay, ''Well, I must have these material necessities. Not to be able to attract\n\nthose necessities is weakness, ''\n\nTYPES OF One may develop magnetism of various kinds: to attract the\nMAGNETISM highest power of God, to gain mental power, or to attract\n\nyour daily necessities. God has given you a body and you\nhave to look after it. But if you develop and use all your magnetism to acquire\nmaterial things and mental power you will be disillusioned in the end. If you\ndevelop divine magnetism,that power will also look after all your material\nneeds. That is why Jesus said, ''Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all\nthese things shall be added unto you.'' But you must live that law! I know that\nlaw works; I have seen it work.\n\nHOW TO DEVELOP First of all you must build a body that is strong and\nPHYSICAL MAGNETISM | sure of itself--not to the point of vanity, but a body\n\n"}

Picture alazy man going about his work with no\n© ambition, no energy at all. Then visualize a race horse ready to run at the\ncrack of a whip. That is how your body must be. We all know some old\npeople who are very healthy and young in body, well under control, and full\nof magnetism. Despite age they have a wonderful personality.\n\nDon't sit back lazily. It devitalizes you. Your body must always be at\nyour command, even when you sit down. Notice the way people sit in their\nchairs. One person may bevery lazy and slumped; the minute you see him\nyou feel tired. Another sits up straight and you know he is alive. When you\nlook at him you respond accordingly. And you must learn to stand erect; I\nnever saw my Master slump. You will never find God if you indolently or\ncarelessly allow your spine to be cramped by wrong posture. Learn to sit\nand stand straight. Some men and women walk with their bay windows going\nahead of them--their shoulders drooping. Others walk with energy. When\nthey don't keep in condition, ladies show it in the hips and men show it in the\nstomach. So, you must be sure to remember the importance of posture and\n\nregular exercise.\n\nEFFECT OF DIET Eat abundantly of fruits and vegetables, to increase\nON MAGNETISM magnetism. Fruits especially have a magnetic quality,\nand they don't clog the system. Too much protein and\n७ starchy food retain the poisons in your body.\n\nAny organ that is defective will cause imbalance in the body. The stomach\nespecially must be kept in perfect condition. If, for instance, you are troubled\nwith gas in the stomach it will greatly devitalize your magnetism. Overeating\nis very bad. Fasting, on the other hand, develops magnetism--but that doesn't\nmean that you should starve yourself. People who eat meat three times a day\nhave dull eyes, whereas those who eat plenty of fruit invariably have bright\neyes. Proper diet in itself, however, is not enough; it must be backed up by\nyour mind, ever ready to obey your will.\n\nGAINING MENTAL Always center your whole mind on whatever you may be\nMAGNETISM doing, however small or seemingly unimportant it may\n\nbe. Also learn to keep your mind flexible so that you\ncan transfer your attention at a moment's notice. But above all do everything\nwith one hundred per cent concentration. That will develop great magnetism.\nMost big businessmen, or men of success in any line of work, know how to\nuse this magnetic power.\n\nIf you are a slave to any of the senses you will lose magnetism. Gaining\ncontrol over them develops your magnetism. But happiest of all is he who has\ninward control to maintain an even mind without becoming emotional. Emo-\ntionalism must be converted into power, into strength of mind. Let your\n\n@ emotion be governed by wisdom--then you have magnetism.

Then after pacifying the people he used strength. He gave\nthem reason with emotion in order to rouse them. Intelligence combined with\nemotion createsmagnetism. The magnetic man talks with conviction. He\nspeaks intellectually but he invests his words with emotion. Marc Antony,\nwhile ''sugar-coating'' his speech, was nevertheless perfectly sincere. You\nmust be sincere when you say anything. But to be sincere does not require\nthat you bludgeon everyone on the head with the truth.\n\nEFFECT OF Your attention must always be objective whenever you asso-\nMAGNETISM ciate with people. Absent-mindedness destroys personality\nON OTHERS more than anything else. (I don't mean, however, that\n\nabsent-mindedness of great men whose minds are absorbed\nin one subject.) Be fully awake and conscious at all times and you will be an\nattractive magnet. Nobody likes to be ignored. We all want to be noticed, if\nfor no other purpose than to get along with people--and that is most important.\nIn order to do so you must be a \"live wire. '' A dead man doesn't insult me,\nbut an absent-minded man does. One might as well be in the company of a\ndead man as to be in the company of an absent-minded man.\n\nWhen you are with others always be aware of yourself, but be careful in\ntalking about yourself. Everyone likes to talk about himself but it's a poor\npolicy. Let others talk about themselves so that you can be a good listener..\nLet others talk about their problems and their impressions, but let your mag-\nnetism talk about you. Whena \"live wire' comes into a room his whole vibra-\ntion talks about him. So, remember, it is better to be attractive because of\nthat silent vibration.\n\nNot many people know that you can steal others' magnetism. When you\nshake hands with someone a magnet is formed. The other person's feet and\nyour own, form one magnet; and both of your heads form a higher magnet.\n\nThe one who is stronger gives his vibration to the other. The weaker person\nreceives the vibration. The moment you even look at a person you have\nformed a magnetic exchange of vibrations. If you look at a sensual person, a\nmagnet of lower or grosser vibration will be formed; and if you mix with\nspiritual people the exchange of magnetism will be on a higher vibratory plane.\nYou are constantly exchanging magnetism, often unknowingly, by thinking of,\nby shaking hands with, or just by looking into the eyes of another person. It\nis strange but true that as soon as your heart is with someone you draw all\nthe defects and good qualities of that person. Take care therefore not to con-\ncentrate on wicked individuals, for you may attract their bad qualities. It is\ndifferent, of course, if you want to help those who may need it, but you must\nbe stronger than they are, or instead of giving them something you will attract\ntheir deficiencies. If you want to be an author, think of a great writer. By\nconcentrating on any one personality you can attract that personality. There-\nfore, you must place your love in true individuals.\n\n"}

So long as your\nmaterial impulses dictate your behavior, you will feel the need for certain\npossessions; but remember, every time that you waste power in going after\nunnecessary material possessions you are farther away from your infinitely\nmore desirable goal; divine magnetism that attracts God, the Giver of all.\n\nRK\nTHE SAINT WHO WENT TO HADES SPEAKING TRUTH--Part 2\n\nYears later, the saint consciously left his physical body in the ecstasy of\nCosmic Consciousness and ascended in his astral form to the kingdom of\n\nheaven. immediately Yama; the keeper of hell, visited him in heaven and told\n\nhim that before he could obtain the final decree of the Supreme Spirit to remain\nin heaven, he must witness the loathsome Hades. Disturbed, the saint replied:\n\"Honored Yama, this is outrageous. Ihave lived a moral life, weighing each\naction with mathematical accuracy from the standpoint of truth. I have always\nfollowed truth and performed truthful and just actions. Iam sure that I don't\ndeserve the punishment of visiting Hades even for a short time. \"'\n\nThe great Yama replied: \"Honored Sir, no doubt you are right about your-\nself in everything except one act. You say that you never did anything but\nwhat was truthful and just. Why is it then that you were foolish enough to suf-\nfer your hand to be cut off, and the head of a man to be cut off, for stating a\nfact? Iam afraid that you are all mixed up about the difference between justice\nand truth, and the pronouncement of a fact. A just and truthful action always\nresults in good; whereas your statement of a fact, which resulted in great\nharm to yourself and to that man, was far from ultimate truth and justice.\n\n\"Why didn't you save yourself from harm, and also save a man's life, by\npointing your finger in the wrong direction? Even if you had uttered a false-\nhood, you would have committed a much less horrible sin than that of being\nthe deciding factor in the murder of an innocent man who sought and believed\nin the safety of your shelter.

Thus we may be able to put on at will\nthe protective armor of self-control whenever we are involved in situations\nwith persons whose dispositions are destructive to others' peace and well-\nbeing. Whenever any trouble occurs with our friends or dear ones, we\nshould inwardly lay the blame on ourselves for getting into an unpleasant situ-\nation and then try to get out of it as fast and as graciously as we can. It is\nfruitless to increase the trouble by loudly, unkindly, discourteously blaming\nothers, even though we find that they are to blame. We can teach quick-\ntempered dear ones to mend their faults a hundred times better by setting a\ngood example than we can by harsh or self-righteous words. Sermons given\nunkindly to error-prejudiced mentalities are not only unappreciated, but mis-\nunderstood. Misunderstanding produces a meaningless hot exchange of words.\nThe bitter words that we did not really mean only create more havoc, more\nmisunderstanding. This is how people who love one another deeply in the\nbeginning sometimes turn their love into violent hatred.\n\nNo matter. what trials come, remember that the greatest test of one's\nspiritual aspiration lies in his control of himself in his own home environ-\nment--especially if it is a discordant one. If a person's inner peace can ex-\nhibit stability and strength at home, and if he conquers others' quarrelsome\ndispositions by his constant, beautiful expressions of undying love, then he\nwill become a prince of peace.\n\nWe should try to conquer ugly, negative behavior by the power of posi-\ntive, good behavior. We should always try to overcome inharmony by display\nof the best that is inus. Self-reformation, self-control, positive behavior,\ncontrol of speech, sweet words, all these are soul powers that clothe us in\nrobes of magnetism. Inthe expression of soul qualities lies the only way to\nlive peacefully at home; the power is within us to make home a paradise ora\n\nhades.\n\nControl of speech is one of the first laws of right behavior.

When people\n\ntry to handle the extremely complicated machinery of hu-\nman feelings without any training whatsoever, the consequent results are\noften disastrous. Very few persons realize that most of our happiness lies\nin the art of understanding the law of human behavior. That is why so many\npeople are often \"in hot water\" with their friends, and, worse yet, at con-\nstant war with their own best beloved ones at home. They do not understand\nothers' behavior and do not see the faults in their own.\n\nTwo important aspects of right behavior are non-cooperation with the\nwrongdoings of loved ones, and silent resistance by opposite spiritual actions.\nWe should not stoop to incivility, vulgarity, and physical threats in trying to\nprevent the erroneous doings of those whom we love. We must remember\nthat by adding our own impatience, anger, or excitement to the ugliness ex-\npressed by them, we increase the power of discord in our dear ones. We un-\nconsciously try to conquer inharmony by ourselves becoming inharmonious,\nand, as fire increases fire, so wrath increases wrath, and discourtesy stim-\nulates others' incivility. The spiritual man conquers wrath by calmness,\nstops quarrels by keeping silence, dispels inharmony by being sweet of speech,\nand shames discourtesy by being thoughtful of others.\n\nThose who are not mentally and emotionally strong enough to control\nthemselves should run from the scene of trouble. Those who are sure to be\nsubdued by others' nagging should take temporary flight, and thereby prevent\ntheir opponents from having the satisfaction of crushing them with unkindness.\nOne should take such flights as often as necessary; indeed, he cannot take\nthem frequently enough if anyone very dear to him constantly loosens shafts\nof unkindness upon him!\n\nWe should be especially careful not to talk when someone tries his ut-\nmost by ugly words to make us confess our weaknesses.

The result of such self-betrayal is that\nothers trample on and shatter the backbone of one's peace of mind.\n\nIf we learn to respect the opinions of our dear ones, they will respect\nours.

In order to perform important\nduties, recall valuable experiences for guidance in daily living, or to write,\nthink, and feel, one must utilize the precious material recalled to the con-\nscious mind by the power of memory.\n\nHence development of the memory faculty is very important. Some psy-\nchologists believe that the quality of one's memory is a congenital gift--that\nsuperior power and quality of memory cannot be developed by training. The\nyogis of India have shown, however, that the more you practice remembering\ndeep experiences the more you will develop your memory--that faculty of the\nconscious mind which, through the help of the subconscious mind, can repro-\nduce any past conscious human experience.\n\nThe conscious mind in the brain keeps in touch with the exterior world\nthrough the medium of sensations and perceptions--messages carried over\nthe five sense telephones of touch, taste, sight, smell, and hearing by affer-\nent and efferent nerves. The subconscious or inly flowing mind keeps a\nrecord of all these experiences, with special emphasis on the important ones.\n\nThe semisuperconscious state is felt during deep sleep; pure supercon-\nsciousness is experienced during deep meditation. Both states have intuitive\npower. It is through intuition, rather than the senses (which are scarcely\nfunctioning during deep sleep), that we understand, upon awakening, how deep-\nly or restlessly we have slept.\n\nHOW THE SUPERCONSCIOUS, The superconsciousness is the pure intuitive,\nSUBCONSCIOUS, AND all-seeing, ever-new blissful consciousness\nCONSCIOUS MINDS WRK of the soul. This superconsciousness de-\n\nscends into the deep sleep state and becomes\na semisuperconsciousness, marked by a semiconscious blissful state. Then\nthis semiconsciousness, descending into the dream state and the state of imag-\nination, becomes the subconscious mind and is marked by disturbance mixed\nwith bliss. The subconsciousness, descending into the nervous system and\nmuscles, becomes the conscious state. This conscious waking state is most-\nly a mixture of worries; very little of the joyous superconscious state is\n\n"}

When the superconsciousness comes down into the nerves, mus-\ncles, and the senses, it is called conscious mind. The subconscious mind\nand the conscious mind, being manifestations of the superconsciousness, both\nhave intuitive powers. That is why dreams perceived by the subconscious\nmind may come true, and strong feelings or \"hunches\" of the conscious mind\nmay also come true.\n\nThe superconscious, subconscious, and conscious minds all are working\ntogether. Sometimes one is more active than the other two, which neverthe-\nless go on working in the background. When a person is calm and blissful,\nthe superconsciousness is manifest in the conscious mind.\n\nWhen one is imaginative, it is the subconscious mind that is predominant-\nly manifest. When one is thinking fast, his conscious mind buries beneath it\nall calm and imaginative traits of the superconscious and subconscious facul-\nties.\n\nWHERE IS YOUR The conscious mind is manifest only during wakefulness.\n\nCONSCIOUSNESS It sleeps during the hours when the subconscious mind\nCENTERED? is predominant. The subconscious mind is the memory\n\nmind. It is the mental refrigerator in which all experi-\nences are kept in storage, fresh and ready to be used again upon instant\nnotice. All experiences from the conscious mind enter the vault of subcon-\nsciousness and remain there; but they may come out into the conscious mind\nagain through some new opening of thought or experience.\n\nThe superconscious mind remains buried beneath the subconscious mind,\nand the subconscious mind is buried beneath the conscious mind. Working\nlike a janitor while you sleep, the subconscious mind keeps the fire going in\nthe bodily furnace and sees that the circulatory machinery is functioning\nproperly. During wakefulness, the subconscious mind is continuously memo-\nrizing conscious experiences. The subconscious mind is always awake, oper-\nating the involuntary organs during sleep and memorizing conscious experi-\nences during wakefulness.\n\nThe superconsciousness, through intuition, knows everything that goes\non in the subconsciousness and consciousness. It can remember all experi-\n\nences, including those mislaid by the subconscious mind and forgotten by the\nconscious mind. The superconscious mind can be educated in the school of\nmeditative discipline to recall all the experiences of this life and even exper-\niences of past incarnations.

Similarly untrained, the subconscious mind loses\nits powers of creative imagination and recall, and becomes forgetful. The\nsuperconscious mind, when neglected, loses its power of all-seeing intuition.\n\nMemory is the power of recollection by which we are saved from remain-\ning like children throughout life (as we would if we had no memory of past\nexperiences), and it prevents us from repeating undesirable experiences\nevery day. Through memory the identity of individual existence is maintained.\nFor instance, a minister who lost his memory for a while thought that he was\na grocer.

In an agony of fright\nshe saw that the angel of death was proceeding to leave her in that dismal\ntract where sinful shadow-beings lived in torture and despair, and she wailed\nfor mercy.\n\nThe piercing, plaintive cry of the wicked woman somehow touched Yama,\nwho turned back to her.

Then I\nnoticed that one of them contained a worm, so I gave that defective carrot to\nanother person on condition that he eat only the good part and throw away the\nrest without killing the worm.\"\n\n\"That will do,'' replied Yama. He made a conjuring motion with his hand,\nand the defective carrot came floating through the air toward Kalaha. Then\nYama continued: ''Wicked woman, grasp this carrot and hang onto it; don't\nloosen your hold, and you will reach heaven.\"\n\nKalaha greedily seized the carrot and started to rise from the floor of\nHades. Seeing this, another sinner took hold of her legs, and a second sinner\nheld the legs of the first, and a third hung onto the legs of the second, and so\non until a chain of a hundred sinners became suspended from the feet of the\nwicked woman. At Yama's behest the carrot, drawing the wicked Kalaha and\nthe chain of a hundred sinners, began to race heavenward through the sky\nlike a zooming rocket.\n\nThe woman was overjoyed to find herself so easily freed from the hands\n\n_of after-death justice.

Her wicked companions, because\nof their faith in even a shameless wrongdoer like Kalaha, captured the carrot,\nwhich mysteriously came near the hands of the first man, and the whole chain\nof them raced up, up, and up to the immortal gates of heaven.\n\nThe moral is that even a small act of goodness may be a raft of salvation\nacross the treacherous gulf of sin; but one who drinks the wine of selfishness\nand dances recklessly in the boat of meanness sinks in the ocean of ignorance.\nSelfish happiness, which ignores and cannot bear to witness the well-being of\nothers, is bound to come to grief.

At this the philosopher looked very wise and pityingly remarked, ''Mr.\nBoatman, Iam sorry to say that without some knowledge of the first Hindu\nBible twenty-five percent of your life is as good as lost. '' The boatman took\nthis insult quietly and kept on rowing his boat.\n\nThey had gone some distance across the Ganges when the arrogant philos-\nopher made further inquiry: \"Mr. Boatman, I must ask if you have studied the\nsecond Hindu Bible?'' The boatman betrayed his annoyance as he replied:\n\"Sir, I tell you definitely that I know nothing about the second Hindu Bible.\"\n\n_ With cool amusement the philosopher then declared: \"I am sorry to tell you_\n\nthen that fifty percent of your life is as good as 1096. \" Still holding his tongue\nin spite of this further affront, the boatman angrily kept to his work at the oars.\n\nThe small craft was nearing the middle of the river, and the wind had be-\ncome a little strong, when for the third time the Hindu philosopher's eyes\nglinted with superiority. ''Mr. Boatman, tell me, have you studied the third\nHindu Bible?'' The boatman was now in no mood to be trifled with. \"I told you\nbefore, '' he said testily, 'I don't know anything about the Hindu Bibles.'' The\nphilosopher then declared in pompous tones, ''Mr. Boatman, it is my duty to\nannounce to you that seventy-five percent of your life is as good as lost.'' The\nboatman mumbled angrily to himself, and wished with all his heart that this\nimpossible philosopher had found someone else to row him across the river.\n\nTen minutes had passed in silence, when a sudden storm ripped the veils\nof the clouds and sprang like a demon over the water of the river, lashing it\ninto furiously excited waves. The boat began to rock like a floating leaf in the\ntumultuous waves. The pundit shivered and trembled, but the boatman, with a\nsmile of assurance on his face, said: ''Mr. Philosopher, you have pelted me\nwith questions; now may I ask you 0786? 11\n\nReceiving an affirmative reply, the boatman went on: ''Well, Mr. Philos-\nopher, knower of the four Hindu Bibles, you established that seventy-five per-\ncent of my life is lost.

Most\nOF HABIT people go through life mentally making good resolutions, with-\nout ever succeeding in following what is wholesome. We usual-\nly do not do what we wish to do, but only what we are accustomed todo. That\nis why materially minded persons find it difficult to be spiritually minded\neven when they try hard. So also spiritual persons find it difficult to be mate-\nrial even when they associate with materially minded people. It is not easy ©\nfor vicious men to be good and it is hard for noble men to be mean.\n\nHabits are automatic mental machines installed by man to exercise econ-\nomy in the use of initial will power and effort required in performing actions.\nHabit makes the performance of actions easier. Friendly habits help one to\nperform difficult good deeds easily. Evil habits, however sympathetic, are\ndeadly, inasmuch as they are diehards and keep on disturbing the routine of\nlife even when they are strongly willed not todo so. Bad habits and sin are\ntemporary misery-making grafts on the soul. They must be thrown out\nsometime.\n\nGood habits and virtues are eternal joy-making qualities. It is lamenta-\nble to be compelled to do evil against one's will, because of the strength of\nan evil habit, and then to have to suffer for one's actions. It is wonderful to\ndo what is right habitually, and thus multiply goodness and happiness.\n\nMaterial desire, and ego, or body consciousness, go together. Ina\npsychological battle between the habit of yielding to temptation and the habit\nof self-control, the latter may easily subdue the former, but it is very hard\nfor good habits to overcome newly created, constantly evolving material\ndesires of the body-bound ego. @\n\nBody consciousness gives rise to material desire.

If this body consciousness, or ego, is con-\nquered by the consciousness of omnipresence in Spirit, then King Material\nDesire and all his armies of sense tendencies are instantly slain. Body\nattachment of the ego and its desires fleeslike darkness before the light of\nsoul's consciousness of Omnipresence.\n\nWe are soldiers of God who have come with the power of love, the power\nof wisdom, and the power of spirituality to spread the fire of Spirit that burns\nall darkness from human lives.\n\nNONATTACHMENT Nonattachment is the way to happiness. Freedom is\n\nIS THE WAY 7०: kingship. Mental freedom is not necessarily accom-\nHAPPINESS panied by outer freedom. Nothing belongs to you and\neverything belongs to you. If you say: ''This is mine,\"\n\nyou have limited yourself to that thing only, and excluded all else. Then you\nare deluded. Never grieve for anything that is taken. Maybe in this life you\nwill lose all = and yet, when you have God, you will always have every-\nthing. There is no limitation to what you can get. It is wonderful to test\nyourself with whatever you have and disown all things from your heart. Enjoy\nthem and take care of them, but just disown them from your heart--develop\nnonattachment.\n\nNonattachment does not sanction neglect of our worldly obligations. It\n\n“means performance of our material duties with the sole desire to please God |\n\nand serve His children without a sense of personal gain. When we perform\nan act, or eat, or earn money with the sole purpose of being the beneficiary\nof our actions we limit our consciousness and thus we do not expand.\n\nYou should analyze every thought that you have. View its positive and\nnegative sides and determine its relative value. We are not always prepared\nto be nonattached. We have to understand first why we should not be attached.\nWhen something that you think you are not attached to suddenly drops and is\nsmashed beyond repair, and you grieve for it, you may be sure that you are\nattached to it. You should then say that you had only been given the use of it\nand that you are happy to have had it for a while. We must be able to hold\nthat attitude toward everything and everybody. It is not heartlessness. It is\nreal expansion of the heart; but when it concerns human beings, nonattach-\nment seems to be very difficult to conceive.\n\nAttachment is a sort of blind feeling that tortures the soul and does not\naccomplish anything. Attachment is not love. It makes one miserable for\nhis own loss. Real love is happy only in the happiness of the beloved. You\nsay that you love your friend, a wonderful friend; you enjoy his company;\nyou love to serve him--and then he leaves you. If, when he has gone, you\nforget him, you are heartless.

Whatever is the will of God\n\nand whatever is best for him, that is your wish.\n\nLAW OF Habits of thought are mental magnets which draw unto them-\nSPIRITUAL selves specific objects relative to the kind and quality of their\nHABITS magnetism. Material habits attract material things and spiri-\n\ntual habits attract spiritual things. Bad habits attract bad\nexperiences. Good habits attract good experiences.\n\nThroughout the ages the majority of mankind has emphasized the materi-\nal, overlooking for the most part the development of the spiritual. Is it not\ntime now that the spiritual should be given its proper place in the develop-\nment of the threefold nature of man? Owing to this great need, let us see if\nwe cannot find a definite method of procedure which will aid materially in\nthe development of a higher state of consciousness.\n\n\"For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall\nhave abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away\neven that which he hath. '' (Matthew 25: 29)\n\nThis illustrates the law of spiritual habit, and, in fact, of all kinds of\nhabits. The material interpretation of the above Bible quotation shows that @\nif a man develops the habit of making money, for instance, more and more\nprosperity will come to him, and the man who has not the habit of prosperity\n\nwill lose even the prosperity consciousness that he once had. The person\n\nwho has already acquired the habit of attracting abundance through the cosmic\n\nlaw of success will attract more prosperity, but the person who has not culti-\n\nvated the habit of attracting prosperity will not be prosperous until he does\n\nacquire the habit. This is a lesson to men and women to create right habits\n\nin their daily activities.\n\nThe above biblical law depicts the law of karma (action) spoken of in the\nHindu scriptures. The law of action is based upon the law of cause and effect.\nIf you are born good now, you were good before birth in another incarnation;\nand if you are good, you will attract still more good. If you have very few\ngood tendencies within you, you may lose what you have by the invasion of\npowerful bad habits. If you were born inclined to be bad, it is an indication\nthat you had bad tendencies before, and you will attract more evil. If you\nare only slightly bad, you were so before, and the greater good within you,\nacquired from past incarnations, will destroy the meager evil which you now\nhave within you.\n\nThis is the natural working of the law, but do not feel helpless if you\nhappen to have undesirable habits that you wish to discard. Conquer them | ।\nby developing will power and the habit of regular, right meditation. Youhave\nthe power to free yourself from the clutches of wrong habits and to create\n\n"}

Those who medi-\n\ntate little and only vaguely feel His presence find that\ntheir desire to meditate and contact God vanishes when the mind is invaded\nby the powerful habit of restlessness. Likewise, those who are accustomed\nto being calm attract calmness and serenity, while those who are a little\ncalm find their calmness easily disturbed when restlessness invades. Strong\nunspiritual habits entirely destroy the power of weak spiritual habits.\n\nIt is a fact that in meditation the devotee finds his body consciousness\nresisting the consciousness of Omnipresence. He also finds that the ego con-\nsciousness often wants to make an encouraging noise by breathing fast, thus\ninviting the senses to destroy the breathlessness of meditation. The minute\nthe ego breathes fast (referred to in the Gita as the blowing of the conch\nshell, which produces material sounds through the action of air), then the\nmaterial desires of the body are awakened and cheered, and fight to drive\naway the vast Spirit consciousness which is born of our stillness and medita-\ntion.\n\nDuring meditation any material vibration sent forth by the ego helps to\n‘awaken material desires, to revive the consciousness of the body and to dis- `\npel the consciousness of the vastness of Spirit. After the ego creates a\nmaterial vibration, the senses also begin to create different vibratory sounds\nin order to drown out the musical astral sounds of the discriminative tenden-\n\ncies in the astral spinal centers.\n\nAll students of Self-Realization Fellowship can understand that during the\nearlier states of meditation, when ego consciousness is awake and blows the\nconch shell of breath, the sense organs of heart, circulation, and lungs make\nmany peculiar thumping, throbbing, and purring sounds to drown out the\nastral music emanating from the astral body.\n\nMeditation opens up all the closed inner gates in the spine and brain that\nbring power to your body, mind, and soul. When you meditate your body\nbecomes filled with electricity or life energy that isever present in the ether.\nMost people do not realize that. Meditation is the turning on of the inner\nswitch that fills the body with the divine current. That is why it is so impor-\ntant to keep your concentration on the aftereffects of meditation every minute\nof one's existence. Do not neutralize that peace with disturbing thoughts.\n\nIf you gather concentration in a pail of meditation, and have a leak of restless-\nness, your concentration will run out. You must not have any mental leaks.\n\n1.\n\n"}

The deer becomes\nexcited by the attractive odor and frisks about, sniffing under the trees, and\nsearching everywhere, sometimes for many weeks, to find the source of the\nfragrance. Sometimes the deer grows angry and very restless when he is\nunable to find the source of the musk perfume, and jumps to his death from\nthe high cliffs into the valley, trying in a last desperate effort to reach the\nsource of the rare fragrance.

In India we seek in many places until we find the right master and the\nright path for us; once the guru has been found, we remain loyal to him through\ndeath and eternity, until we become one with him and attain final emancipation.\n\nThose who have come to Self-Realization Fellowship truly seeking inward\nspiritual help shall receive what they seek from God. Whether they come while\nIam inthe body, or afterward, the power of God through the link of the SRF\nGurus shall flow into the devotees just the same, and shall be the cause of their\nsalvation.\n\nAll true gurus are \"living, '' whether in a physical body or not. Their con-\nieee is attuned to their disciples, whether or not all are living on the\nsame plane. One of the essential qualities and manifestations of a true guru is\nomnipresence.\n\nSt. Francis of Assisi, through his devotion to Christ, his guru (whom St.\nFrancis had never knownin the flesh), achieved a perfect oneness with Jesus,\nin soul, mind, and body (the wounds of Christ appearing as stigmata on the body\nof St. Francis). This state of perfect union occurs when the disciple makes\nhimself perfectly receptive to the seen or unseen direction of his guru.\n\nAll devotees who are regular and faithful in their practice of SRF teachings @\nshall find that their lives become purified and transformed.

Those who come to learn from a teacher may be called ''stu-\ndents, '' but the spiritual aspirants who come to a guru for an eternal relation-\nship are called \"disciples. '' Jesus said, ''No man can come to me, except the\nFather which hath sent me draw him\" (John 6:44). All true gurus, like Jesus,\nmanifest the universal Christ Consciousness that every man must himself experi-\nence in order to go back to the Father. And no man finds a guru unless the\nHeavenly Father Himself has drawn that disciple to that guru.\n\nMost human souls are truant children of God, who have roamed away from\nHim and become lost in the wilderness of suffering. Impelled by the scourge of\nsorrow, such souls begin to yearn for and to have faint glimpses of their lost\nhome of spiritual blessedness. When His errant children begin thus to long for\nGod, and inwardly to pray deeply and strongly for a way out of the conundrum of\nlife, God is touched by their pleas. The Father then sends help in the form of\nan enlightened (i.e. , God-conscious) guru who guides Home these lost seeking\n\nsouls.\n\nSuch a guru, ordained by God to help individuals in response to their deep\nprayers, is not an ordinary teacher; but is a human vehicle whose body, speech,\nmind, and spirituality God uses as a channel to attract and guide lost souls back\nto His home of immortality. We meet various teachers in the beginning, through\nour vague desire to knowtruth. Buta guru is a living embodiment of scriptural\ntruth and an agent of salvation appointed by God in response to a devotee's\nincessant petitions for release from the bondage of matter.\n\nIt is very difficult to choose the right path for oneself from among the many\nreligious paths and varied religious opinions. Most people who wander from\nchurch to church seeking intellectual inspiration fail to find God in this life, for\nintellectualism is necessary only until one begins to ''drink'' God, that is, to\ncommune with Him. It is not wrong to seek intellectual inspiration in order to\nencourage the desire for actual God-contact. But when intellectual inspiration\nbegins to satisfy the seeker (so that he ceases striving to experience actual God-\ncontact), it is detrimental to his progress in Self-realization.\n\nBut when a devotee becomes ready, God sends him a guru; because it is\neasier for the aspirant to follow a living man who embodies truth, or one whom\nhe knows by the testimony of other disciples to have demonstrated truth, than\n\n"}

A saint who has reached the divine ©\nGoal, whether by the scientific yoga route or by the longer spiritual-prayer\n\nway, experiences actual Self-realization. Through the divine glory of his own\n\nsoul he beholds God.\n\nA scripture, no matter what records of spiritual truths it contains, is not\nas useful as a saint, whose life has set an example that others may beneficially\nfollow. There is a vast difference between powerful sulfuric acid and the mere\nstatement of its formula, 72504. Neither the formula nor a written description\nof the power of sulfuric acid can describe adequately its burning vital quality.\nSo scriptural truths that we know only by reading about them are like little in-\nsignificant-looking seeds; their power and wisdom-yielding qualities may be\nrecognized only when we see them grown into the huge trees of saintly human\nlives, laden with fruits of divine love grown in the garden of Self-realization.\n\nThe path followed by a man of Self-realization may safely be followed by\nany spiritual aspirant. Anyone who emulates a guru's life example and his teach-\nings certainly will reach the same goal of Self-realization, whether he follows\nthe yoga highway or the longer way of prayer. Ordinary prayers will not evoke\nany conscious response from God. To be vital, prayers should be offered in\ndeep meditation, intensely, for many hours continuously, until divine response\ncomes.\n\nOnce the relationship of guru and disciple has been truly established, there\nshall be no more blind spiritual groping; therefore, there should be no further\nspiritual roaming, nor any parting because of some candid admonition on the\npart of the guru or for any other reason. Usually there is instantaneous recog-\nnition between guru and disciple if they have met before; but sometimes it takes\na long time for the disciple to remember consciously that past close friendship,\nor to recall the forgotten memory of past incarnations together, so long buried\nbeneath ash heaps of ignorance.\n\nSIGNS OF A GURU Just as the state of sleep manifests in the body by certain\n\nphysiological changes, so the muscles, eyes, and breath\nall become still during cértain states of cosmic consciousness.

Atrue guru\nmay be ordained only by another God-realized guru to serve and to save others;\nor else he must hear in reality the voice of God asking him to redeem others.\nSome men become self-appointed gurus after reading a few occult books and\nlistening to the voice of their own misguided imagination or of their undisci-\nplined subconscious mind.\n\nOBEDIENCE TO THE GURU-- My guru Sri Yukteswar said to me, when he\nITS MEANING AND PURPOSE accepted me for training: ''Allow me to dis-\n\ncipline you; for freedom of will does not con-\nsist in doing things according to the dictates of prenatal or postnatal habits or\nof mental whims, but in acting according to the suggestions of wisdom and free\nchoice. If you tune in your will with mine, you will find freedom.\" My will\nhad been guided formerly by habits; but when I obeyed my Guru, tuning in my\nwill with his God-guided, wisdom-guided will, I did find freedom.\n\nA real guru is sent by God. To tune in with the guru's will is to find true\nfreedom of one's own will. Teachers who slavishly control their students after\na dogmatic pattern destroy in them the power of free will. Such teachers want\nthe student to see only as the teacher sees. Obedience to atrue guru, however,\ndoes not produce any such spiritual blindness in the disciple. On the contrary,\nit develops the disciple's \"single €$€ '' of wisdom and intuition whereby he may\nact wisely out of his own free choice. A guru disciplines the disciple only until\nthe latter is spiritually able to guide himself through his own unfolding soul -\n\nwisdom.\n\nDEFINITION OF Very few people know what it means to enjoy real\n\"FREEDOM OF WILL\" freedom of will. To be compelled to do things by the\n\ndictates of one's instincts and habits is slavery. Nor\nis it true freedom to be good because you have been habitually good fora long\ntime, or to refrain from evil because you are accustomed to shunning wrong\nactions. Real happiness comes only when your will is guided by soul-discrim-\nination to choose good instead of evil, any time, anywhere, because you sincere-\nly want good for its own sake. Then you will be really free.\n\nEvil, 1. €. , ignorant, acts bring us only sorrow. When the influences of\nhereditary, prenatal, and postnatal habits; and family, social, and world envi-\nronments all cease to influence your judgment; when you can act, guided solely\nby your highest inner intuitive discrimination; then only are you free. Until\nthen, ''the way of all righteousness'' lies in tuning in your whim-guided will with\nthe wisdom-guided will of your guru. By thus harnessing your will to his divine\nwisdom, you will cease to be swayed by prejudice and error; you will then be\nguided always by righteousness.\n\nSuch tuning in of your habit- and whim-led will with the wisdom-guided will\n"}

A guru is not a help for this life only.\nHe makes a spiritual soul-contact with the disciple that signifies: ''Let our\nfriendship be eternal, and let us help each other through incarnations until we\nare both completely emancipated in Spirit. '' The guru-disciple relationship is\nnot wholly one-sided; sometimes an advanced disciple may help his guru. In\nsuch friendship there is no room for selfish consideration or any conditional\nreservation. Divine friendship and perpetual goodwill expressed between two\nor more souls gives birth to ever pure, unselfish, all-emancipating, divine\nlove.

He gazed at me with childlike trust.\n\n\"I will love you eternally, Gurudeva!\"\n\n\"Ordinary love is selfish, darkly rooted in desires and satisfactions.

For whatever you do to others you do alsoto yourself.

One may concen-\ntrate on any subject, whether spiritual or material.\n\nMeditation is that form of concentration by which one disengages the atten-\ntion from distracting sensations and thoughts so that it may be applied unreserv-\nedly to God. One does not meditate on money, but solely on God. Withdraw\nthe mind and energy in order to use them in meditation upon God. Deeper and\ndeeper meditation produces more and more of the ever joyous quality of Spirit.\n\nAn advanced student who is engrossed in the ever new, ever increasing joy\nof meditation is always satisfied, and does not chase after the will-o'-the-wisp\nof false and useless desires. The experience of divine joy develops a taste for\nthe finer pleasures that lead to happiness, and thus lessens the desire for gross-\ner pleasures. Divine joy never produces an apathy to any right exertion; it en-\nables one to help others in every way.\n\nThe theological way of prayer and unscientific meditation is the \"bullock\ncart'' way of reaching God, requiring many incarnations. The true meditative\nway, as taught in the SRF Lessons, is the airplane way--the short route to God.\nTue entire body becomes saturated with peace and energy, owing to the contact\nwith God in meditation. ।\n\n"}

The world is full of persons who painstakingly\nkeep insignificant daily engagements but entirely forget their highest engage -\nment with meditation. Individual and group meditation both are desirable.\nTney both recharge the soul with God. In addition, group meditation also re-\ncharges the mind with the vibrations of the spiritual convictions of other souls.\n\nPutting off meditation until tomorrow is a great delusion. By the silently\ntalking, inwardly directing, consciously guiding, ever increasing joy in deeper\nand deeper meditation (as in no other activity) God is manifest; that is, if you\nretain the joyous aftereffects of meditation throughout the day, or part of the\nday, you will see that this joy will correctly guide you in everything. Saints are\nguided by this joy, in the consciousness of which no erroneous actions are possi-\nble. Retain the acquired joy of meditation throughout the day.\n\nLong meditations produce a habit of meditation, and depth or intensity of\nmeditations gives you the contact of God. Meditate intensely when you have only\na little time. Meditate intensely and long in order to become an adept. In in-\ntense and long meditation you will have many wonderful spiritual experiences.\nDon't spill the milk of silence after gathering it in the pail of your concentration.\nYou should remain calm and retain that silence within, ready to use it during\ntrials and to convince God that you love Him as the only real joy.\n\nDoubt or no doubt, restless or calm, result or no result keep meditating\ndaily; but try to increase the depth of it, and you will get results. If you medi-\ntate deeply for eight years, you will never give it up. If you increase the depth\nof meditation and feel the joy more and more, unwholesome sense pleasures\nwill gradually lose their appeal for you as you compare them to the delightful\ntaste of meditation.

It is important to close eyes and\nears in order to prevent the optical and auditory nerves from sending disturbing\nsight and sound sensations to the brain.\n\nIn sleep, you shut off all the five senses: touch, smell, taste, sight, and\nhearing. That is why you sleep free from disturbances. In meditation, you con-\nsciously switch off the five sense telephones and feel eternal ever new Bliss.\nKeep the muscles and limbs quiet. You should use personal zeal to meditate\ndeeply, setting aside all mental and physical resistance.\n\nPrayer is the unscientific way of contacting God. Some people keep their\nbodies outwardly still, but their minds are running in all directions, owing to the\ndistracting sensations coming through the connected sense telephones of touch,\nsmell, and so forth. In meditation you still your muscles and limbs, and then--\nby deepening attention and by the concentration technique--you switch off the life\nenergy from the five sense telephones so that sensations cannot reach the brain.\n\nJust as the tree is hidden in the small seed, so is the divine knowledge of\nOmnipresence hidden in the soul. By looking at the small body through the mind,\n\n.-the- soul becomes-identified with physical limitation. Being identified with the.\n\nappetites of the body, the soul becomes body-bound and forgets that it is the\nreflection of Omnipresent Spirit. By meditation, one learns the art of transfer-\nring the attention from the finite body to Infinity. The soulis withdrawn from the\nbody and made to unite with Spirit, or Omnipresence.\n\nThere are three ways of progressing toward Cosmic Consciousness:\n\n1. The social way of sympathizing with and learning to love your\nfamily, neighbors, country, all races--white, dark, red, yellow,\nbrown--and the whole world as yourself.\n\n2. The way of mental and physical discipline, learning to control\nthe body, mind, and feelings, to maintain mental equanimity\nregardless of outer circumstances.\n\n3, The spiritual way of meditation, whereby one lives in complete\ncontrol of the senses and of the life force in the body, switching\nthe consciousness and will power off and on again at will in the\nSpine, and taking the consciousness out through the medulla\noblongata to the Infinite.\n\nLearn to switch the consciousness on and off from the body, the spine, and\nits six plexuses.

Sitting on a blanket prevents the earth current from tug-\nging at the life force, keeping it sense-bound when the devotee is trying to relax\nduring meditation.\n\nRead again the quotations and explanations: ''In the beginning --God''(John 1:1).\n\"Behold. ..to him\" (Revelation 3:20). Patanjali: 'Meditate on Om... (manifesta-\ntion of creation).'' \"I was in the Spirit...as of a trumpet\" (Revelation 1:10).\n\"These things saith... God\" (Revelation 3:14). \"And I heard a voice... harps\"\n(Revelation 14:2).\n\nScience tells us that all matter is vibrating, that substances produce sound.\nAll creation is vibrating with the intelligent vibration or energy of God, the\nCreator of all things. Science tells us that all vibrations produce sound; the cos-\nmic intelligent vibration produces not only sounds that can be heard with the lim-\nited power of the ears, but also sounds of such subtle vibration that they may be\nheard only by intuition.\n\nCosmic Sound passes through everything, through every human being. By\nclosing the ears and ignoring distracting physical sounds outside and inside the\nbody, one may hear by intuition this omnipresent cosmic sound of Aum and may\ncontact God as Intelligent Cosmic Vibration.\n\nAs the consciousness of the devotee rises above all physical sounds, and\nastral sounds (heard with closed ears), he hears the ever expanding Aum sound.\nHis consciousness, concentrated upon this sound, gradually expands and ulti-\nmately becomes one with the Cosmic Sound or Aum, or Amen, or Holy Ghost,\nor Holy Vibration.\n\nJesus spoke of the Holy Ghost--the Holy Vibration, the God-guided sacred\nvibrating sound or word, or Aum--as the abode in which his Christ Intelligence\nwas encased. Whosoever will listen to this sound--and gradually, by higher\ntechniques and years of meditation, will persist in becoming one with it--will\nfeel the Christ Intelligence vibrating in Cosmic Creative Sound. This is the real\n\"Second Coming\" of Christ.\n\nThe Universal Christ Intelligence manifested itself in the body of Jesus, and\ncan come again in any devotee's consciousness, provided he expands his mind by\nmaking it one with the Cosmic Sound, or Holy Ghost (heard by practicing the Om\nmeditation technique), in which the Christ or Universal Intelligence is hidden.\n\n"}

Though transcendental, Spirit in relation to creation is\ncalled ''God the Father. '! God manifests first as Cosmic Intelligent Vibration.\nThis Cosmic Intelligent Vibration manifests Itself in three forms, as follows:\n\n(1) Ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Joy as the intelligent\nguiding force of the material vibratory universe;\n\n(2) Intelligent cosmic energy;\n\n(3) Intelligent cosmic sound, or Om.\n\nThe devotee contacts God tangibly in meditation as:\n\n(1) Ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new joy;\n\n(2) Visible intelligent cosmic energy, which is the creator of electrons,\natoms, and molecules, and all the tissues of matter;\n\n(3) Cosmic energy epitomized and condensed in the spiritual eye, with\nan opal blue center studded with a palpitating silver star and\nsurrounded by a golden ring.\n\nThese three lights are the symbols and abode of:\n\n(1) Cosmic Vibration ( golden ring );\n(2) Christ Consciousness (opal blue );\n(3) Way to Cosmic Consciousness (silver star).\n\nIn other words, seeing the spiritual eye is not enough. Through continuous\npractice one must be able to hold it steady until one can finally pass through the\nstarry door into the realm of Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nWhen the devotee is not disturbed by any restless thought and is in ecstasy,\nhis consciousness and astral body can penetrate the telescopic golden ring of the\nspiritual eye and behold and feel all the primal energy as it explodes into gross-\ner forms as electrons and atoms of the material universe. To know the mystery\nof the golden ring is to know the mystery of all matter and enter the factory of\n\n"}

To enter the blue telescopic eye is to be aware of Christ Conscious- के\nness, existing in every unit of Cosmic Energy.\n\nThe Om vibration is felt only when the breath is partially still. Often when\nOm is heard, the spiritual eye is seen at the same time if restless thoughts do\nnot disturb the mind. Then the Cosmic Vibration appears as the different lights\nand different sound vibrations of the cerebrospinal plexuses. Beginning at the\nbase of the spine, we have the coccyx (representing earth); the sacral (water);\nlumbar (fire); dorsal (air); and cervical (ether). Above these, at the base ofthe\nskull, is the medulla oblongata or ''mouth of God, \" the distributing point for\nCosmic Energy. Directly connected by polarity with the medulla center is the\nspiritual eye (Christ Consciousness center), located at the point between the eye-\nbrows. The earth center vibrates with the sound of a bumblebee. This is the\n“baby 01.\" The water center vibrates the sound of Krishna's flute; the fire\ncenter, that of a harp; the air or vital center, a deep gong bell; the ether center,\nrushing waters or the sound of a distant sea. The medulla-Christ Consciousness\ncenter vibrates a symphony of all the other sounds commingled, the oceanic roar\nof the Cosmic Om Vibration.\n\nWhen the advanced devotee easily hears the astral sounds (it may require\nlong years of practice) he begins to see the lights of the different plexuses and\nto identify his consciousness with their vibrations. Then he can prove beyond\na doubt, tangibly and definitely, that God is the ever-new, ever-increasing joy\nof meditation. There is nothing else, no experience that man can encounter,\nthat will result in the perception of ever-new joy, except meditation. In nothing @\nelse will you truly feel God. Meditate deeper and deeper and you will contact\nGod as ever-new joy.\n\nThe Om sound is different from ear noises or blood vibrations. It is the\nreflection of the sound that emanates from omnipresent vibrating creation. When\nyou hear a sound in a room, you can hear it in every part of the space in that\nroom, either beneath, above, onthe left, or on the right. Hence, by listening\nto the oceanic roar of the Om sound, one gradually extends his consciousness\nfrom the body to encompass infinite space in the hall of omnipresence.\n\nListening to the Om once or twice isn't sufficient. One must feel and expand\none's consciousness with this sound in all space. It is very important to listen\nregularly and daily for the Cosmic Sound in its perfect clearness. It is best to\ndo this by closing your ears, as taught in previous lessons, even though you may\nalso hear this sound with open ears.\n\nOne hears the Cosmic Sound when the ears are closed, either at once (if one\nis fortunate because of prenatal good karma), or by listening to one sound ata\ntime inthe right ear when both ears are closed by the thumbs. After you have\ncontacted God in this way for some time as the cosmic sound and joy of medita-\ntion you should pray earnestly.\n\nLESSON NO. 31 Concentrate upon the inner eye in order to become thorough-\nly acquainted with it.

Good\nresolutions do not help you unless you use will power in connection with them to\nmanifest them in good actions.

Either consciously or unconsciously your discrimination and will\npower are influenced by the predominating qualities of either good or evil in\nyour associates.

Their\ntentacles spread and grow deep in, until you are strongly bound by their vitality-\nsapping strength.\n\nThe only true freedom lies in wisdom-guided free choice, aided by reason\n\nand a ''do or die'' will power. You will not have to fight alone. As soonas you~\n\n“have roused your will power, determination, and awareness, the hidden occuit\nsoldiers who are always trying to emerge from the superconsciousness to show\nyou, through intuition, the right way to well-being and happiness, will come\nstaunchly to your aid.\n\nThrough daily meditation and actual God-contact, bad habits will loosen\ntheir seemingly inescapable grip. Meditation is the surest way of counteracting\nthe power of temptation and of burning the prenatal seeds of actions, for dark-\nness cannot exist where there is light\n\nBy self-control you free yourself, so that you can assume your rightful\nplace as a freeborn citizen of God's kingdom of cosmic wisdom.\n\nLESSON NO. 44 Travel your own path and do not be jealous because others\nhave things that you do not have. Each soul should sing to\nGod its own song, which is different from any other song. Do not desire to have\nwhat others have. Seek to do brave and lovely things which are left undone by\nthe majority of people. Give gifts of love and peace to those whom others pass\n\nby.\n\nFree your own life from weakness and unlovely qualities. Never indulge in\ngossip and false judgment of others, but teach others by your good example and\nsympathetic heart. Never use ill-chosen words under stress of emotion. Sin-\ncere kindness and sweet, courteous words accomplish much good and bring\n\n"}

You will know by the reaction of those\nabout you what they think of you. Especially try to see yourself in the minds of\ncalm, unprejudiced persons. Your reflection may look very different from what\nyou had fondly imagined in your own hazy understanding.

In being of spiritual, mental,\nand material service to others, you will find your own needs fulfilled. As you\nforget self in service to others, you will find that without seeking it your own\ncup of happiness will be full.\n\nIf conjugal love is to survive the many pitfalls and rocky paths of life, it\nmust have a spiritual basis. Unselfish mutual service and friendship must be\na very part of that love. Always remember, God's divine love is the fountain\nin which all love has its source. It is only because of wrong thoughts, selfish-\n@ ness, and sense lure, that-human-love presents a tarnished appearance. You\ncould never let yourself harm one for whom you have a true, pure, unselfish\nlove. If one you love is straying into wrong paths, you should give him, or her,\nhelp and understanding; never display jealousy and suspicion, thereby driving\nthe loved one farther from you and most likely into deceit. Love and understand-\n\ning foster trust.\n\nIf you recognize in yourself jealousy resulting from a lack of certain per-\nsonal qualities or material advantages, there is a way to turn that jealousy to\ngood account: cultivate those qualities you admire in others, or which will off-\nset your lack of some particular quality. If you desire physical beauty, use\nreasonable aids toward acquiring it, but remember that by developing rare inner\nsoul qualities, your countenance will so radiate with the reflection of inner beauty\nthat people will be conscious only of your contagious smile and magnetic person-\nality. Rare culture, clear conscience, right action, and inner and outer agree-\nableness will win far more genuine admiration than mere physical pulchritude\n\never can.\n\nIn business, the fire of jealousy might be used constructively to burn up\nshortcomings in the management of your own business, but never for a moment\nharbor the thought of bringing harm to your competitors, for in doing so you will\nsquander your thought power. A better way is to consider business success\n\n| । from the standpoint of service to your fellowman.

If you expect others to be honest with you, then be honest with others. |\nLESSON NO, 46 All things in creation have magnetic force. But like the\n\nmagnet, man can attract only that which has relation to\n\nhimself.\n\nTo acquire material necessities man must develop physical magnetism.\nThis requires a sound body. Exercise, diet, and correct posture are very im-\nportant, not only for the sake of health but for the purpose of building a body\nthat is fully alive and ready to obey your command at a moment's notice.\n\nWhen you hold yourself erect while seated, the effect on others is favorable.\nSlumping creates a negative impression. Exercise regularly to keep in condi-\ntion and to prevent the accumulation of useless weight. A diet predominant in\nfresh fruits and vegetables increases magnetism. Too much protein and carbo-\nhydrate clogs the system, thereby causing poisons to be retained in the body. A\nliquid and fruit juice diet for a period at regular intervals is helpful in develop-\ning magnetism. Any defective organ will cause imbalance in the body. The\nstomach especially must be kept in good condition. Important as a proper diet\nmay be, however, remember that it must be reinforced by a keen mind, ever\nready to respond.\n\nAn even mind and inward control under all circumsfances are requisites\nfor mental magnetism. Acquire control over the senses. When you learn to\nconvert emotionalism into power and strength of mind, you will gain the power\nto attract others.\n\nThe magnetic man talks with self-assurance and conviction. He is always\nsincere in his dealings with others. It is important to center your whole mind\non whatever you do, and to keep it flexible so that you can, if need be, shift\nyour attention quickly. All successful people and big business men know how to\nuse this magnetic power.\n\nRemember, too, that you can ‘'steal'’ others' magnetism. By shaking hands\nor even by looking into the eyes of another person, an exchange of magnetism\ntakes place. But the weaker individual receives the vibration. Take care,\ntherefore, not to concentrate on people with negative traits. The same principle\nholds true if you aspire to become great in any chosen field, for you attract the\nqualities of the people with whom you mix.\n\nIf you are a novice on the spiritual path, you should strengthen yourself by\nassociating with those of like determination--or those who have gone farther\nalong the path--until you yourself become a powerful spiritual magnet. Their\nwords may inspire you but, more important, their spiritual vibrations can actu-\nally change you so that you will be a little nearer to your goal. So strive to\nexert all your magnetism to fulfill your greatest need--the realization of God.\n\nLESSON NO. 47 Human behavior and magnetic development are closely\n\n"}

It is by exercising right behavior in all situations that your secret mag-\nnetism is unleashed. Therefore, you should abide by the basic law of good\nbehavior: self-reform. Control your speech by using discretion and silently\nresist the wrong doings of others by your own spiritual actions.\n\nRemember that the greatest test of your spiritual development is in your\nhome environment, in your everyday contact with your family and dear ones.\nSelf-control, continuous goodwill, inner heartfelt courtesy, calmness, kind\nsweet words, firmness in your own principles--these are the powers that clothe\nthe soul in magnetism. You can teach your dear ones and daily associates far\nmore effectively by your example, than by sermons and many words, which so\noften create more misunderstanding. You must exhibit positive good behavior,\n\nclothed in graciousness.\n\nAssociate with persons who have the strongly positive good qualities you\ndesire. Avoid those of strongly positive evil qualities. In developing and\nexchanging magnetism between two persons, the stronger magnetism will pre-\ndominate. If both are equally strong, each will be absorbed to some extent by\nthe other, resulting in good to each if the qualities are good. If one is good and\none is evil, either has a chance of predominating. Choose well, both your asso-\nciates and the qualities of magnetism you desire to develop.\n\nMeditate and contact God, so that your eye of wisdom may be opened. Then,\n\nof Spirit, attracting by this divine magnetism all rays of knowledge and protection.\n\nLESSON NO. 48 In order to perform daily duties and acts of life, one should\n\nhave good memory, which is the art of recalling conscious,\nsubconscious, and superconscious experiences; also prenatal experiences. The\nmore you practice remembering deep experiences, the more you will develop\nyour memory.\n\nIn reality there is only one mind, the pure, intuitive, all-seeing, ever new,\nblissful consciousness of the soul. So long as it is located in the brain and in\nthe point between the eyebrows, and is marked by the all-seeing power of intuitive\now it is called superconsciousness. When it comes down into the nerves, mus-\ncles, and senses, it is called consciousness. In lower brain and spinal centers\nit is called subconsciousness. All three divisions of the mind work together,\nthough sometimes one is uppermost in activity.\n\nWhen superconsciousness is manifest, one is calm and blissful, and highly\nintuitive. The superconscious is the conscience and \"guardian angel.'' It is\nalways trying to get through to guide you toward your highest good. It is always\nawake, watching both the subconscious and conscious minds.\n\nWhen subconsciousness is uppermost, one is imaginative, and the actions\nand words are guided by habit and imagination rather than by reason.

The | ।\nsubconscious is continually memorizing and storing away experiences. Always\nawake, it acts as the janitor of the body when the conscious mind sleeps, and\n\nkeeps the organs and circulatory system on their round of duties. It can be\n\ntrained to correctly memorize and recall at will all conscious experiences.\n\nThe conscious mind is manifest only during wakefulness. It is the thinking,\nreasoning mind, and acts as a sentry at the gate of subconsciousness. In order\nto rightly train the subconscious, the conscious mind must be trained in intro-\nspective, creative thinking, and the channel opened for superconsciousness to\nmanifest its blissful state and all-seeing power of intuition. It is through memo-\nry that the identity of individual existence is maintained.\n\nLESSON NO. 49 Through meditation, delve into the infinite mind, where\nall thoughts of past, present, and future are unveiled.\nLearn to know yourself as one with infinite intelligence and all-seeing wisdom.\n\nMemory should be used and trained to recall only noble and uplifting experi-\nences. Only the good which is gleaned from any experience should be stored in\nthis reservoir of memory. If any slimy thoughts find their way into it, those\nsame thoughts will work their way out into words and acts at some unexpected\ntime. If only the good is present, then only the good can come forth. Guard\nwell the gate of your mind.\n\nDeep, alert attention with feeling is the needle that cuts the grooves in the\nrecord of memory cells. All life is rhythmical, hence regularity in activities\nand studies is a great aid to memory. During the periods of semiwakefulness\njust before and just after sleep, the subconscious is especially retentive and\nattentive. Then is the time to impress upon it those things you wish it to retain.\n\nThere are also certain physical methods of stimulating and developing memo-\nry. Massage the region of the medulla oblongata. Massage the scalp ina rota-\nry direction with the fingers. Gently strike the skull and forehead with the\nknuckles of the hands, with concentration, to awaken the sleeping brain cells.\nApplication of ice water to certain parts of the head and body also helps to liven\nup a dull memory. Care in the diet is also essential. Abstain from the use of\nstimulants and intoxicants.\n\nLESSON NO. 50 Attachment to persons and to things causes you to act from\n\na selfish center. Nonattachment is freedom. When you\nare nonattached, you can see situations in their proper perspective, which makes\nit easier to determine and perform the right action. It means expansion of con-\nsciousness and greater realization of your oneness with God. Attachment is lim-\niting; when you are nonattached, all good is yours, all love is divine love, all\nservice is for God.

Per-\nform material duties with the sense of serving God and God's children, using\nyour wisdom-guided efforts and intelligence in so doing.\n\nBody consciousness gives rise to material desire.

Above all, cultivate the habit of\nmeditation, so that by the mighty power of strong spiritual habits, material\nsense habits will be destroyed. In meditation your body becomes a dynamo of\nelectricity, because all your forces are focused in one direction. This is the\ninner switch which you turn on to connect you with the Infinite.

It means that the disciple recognizes the guru as the agent sent by\nGod to liberate the disciple from the toilsome path of incarnations and to intro-\nduce him to God. It means that the guru, through his diksha, gives the disciple\na spiritual key with which to unlock the cerebrospinal doors behind which the soul\nconsciousness has long remained hidden, and thus prepare himself, with the guru's\never-present inner help and guidance, to meet his Heavenly Father-Creator.\n\nThe solemn promise of our Guru to introduce the Kriyaban (Kriya Yogi) to God\nis an eternal bond, a divine responsibility; and according to the spiritual law,\nmust be reciprocated by the equally solemn promise of the disciple to follow faith-\nfully the precepts of his Guru.

It is because\n\n1) you feel that you are a helpless victim of your already\nformed habits and circumstances, no matter how you try\nto be otherwise;\n\n2) you do not know the technique of psychological victory;\n\n3) you do not put forth the continued effort necessary for\nperfect success.\n\nDo you ask yourself at the end of each day whether you have progressed more\nthan you did the day before? Tomorrow must find you better than today.\n\nThe worst pests that attack our plant of happiness are lack of desire to\nprogress, self-satisfaction, and skepticism. The chill of inertia, or lack of\ndefinite, constant effort to know the truth, is the greatest ill from which our\nhappiness plant suffers. Very few people, except those with master minds,\nare able to use their powers of free choice exclusively to make themselves\nwhat they want to be in life. The majority of people passively allow them-\nselves to grow desultorily, undirected, according to the good or sinister influ-\nences of their prenatal and postnatal habits, or according to the patterns of\npassing moods engendered by specific environments.\n\nIf you grow fat or thin, you can tell that by weighing yourself. If you\ngrow weaker or stronger physically, you can tell that by tensing the muscles\nof your body or lifting a weight; but it is very difficult to measure your intel-\nlectual progress each day, each week, or at the end of each year. Of course,\nintellectual progress is more or less imperfectly measured by the degrees\nobtained at the end of one's college career. The high school graduate, the\nBachelor of Arts college graduate, or the Master of Arts or the Doctor of\nPhilosophy, all acquired a definite degree of intellectual progress in order\n\n"}

Yet one may be a Doctor of Philosophy and lack com-\n\n। । mon sense or real progressive intelligence or cultivated heart qualities. But\nspiritual progress, unlike the intellectual accomplishments, is so subtle that it\nis very hard to ascertain its exact development in people.\n\nEVERYONE IS A God is equally present in everyone, and those who make\nCHILD OF GOD themselves pure and transparent enough to receive and\n\ngive forth His light are surely ''children'' of God. Jesus,\nthe man, by discipline, made himself pure and became Godlike, a Son of God.\nA self-made Christ such as Jesus is an ideal example from which ordinary\nbeings may take hope.\n\nThe Hindu scriptures speak of the body as a machine fraught with six\ndelusive deficiencies: 'It exists; it is born; it grows; it changes; it decays; and\nit is completely annihilated. '' Yet most human beings expect permanent happi-\nness from this impermanent body. The devotee should remember that divine\njoy is much superior to and more engrossing than material pleasures; but\nbecause of the precedence of material pleasures in our experiences, the ego is\nunwilling and unable to picture any other happiness superior to them.\n\nMany persons have dived in the ocean of God's abundance again and again\nto seek the pearls of divine opulence, power, and wisdom, but only a few\ndivers have found them. These few persons have praised the wondrous riches\n@ of God's sea because they dived well and found the secret treasure-nook. Those\nwho dived in the wrong places blamed God's blue brine of abundance as devoid\nof the most desired treasures. Many other divers are attacked by monsters of\nselfishness, greed, faithlessness, doubt, idleness, or skepticism; and so perish.\n\n\"For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have\nabundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even\nthat which he hath'' (Matthew 25:29).\n\nThis illustrates the law of spiritual habit and, in fact, of all kinds of\nhabits. The material interpretation of the foregoing Bible quotation shows that\nif a man develops the habit of making money, for instance, more and more\nprosperity will come to him; and the man who has not created the habit of pros-\nperity will lose even the prosperity consciousness that he has. The person who\nhas already acquired the habit of attracting abundance through the cosmic law\nof success will attract prosperity, and the person who has not cultivated the\nhabit of attracting prosperity will not be prosperous. This is a lesson to men\nand women to create right habits by their daily activities.\n\nPUT YOURSELF Arrange to come in contact with persons who ridicule you,\n\nTO THE TEST or enter into unreasonable arguments with you, or insult\nyou.

You must first control your outer behavior, and then assume an ©\ninner calmness whenever you are the victim of a provocation.\n\nIt is all right not to become a doormat, letting others trample upon you.\nIt is good to be firm, silently resisting ill treatment, but at no time should you\nlose your inner calm attitude of forgiveness and your unruffled mentality, espe-\ncially when you are the target of criticism.\n\nFew people can control their outer behavior. Fewer can control their\ninner balance during a bombardment of unkindness from others. As a student\nof Self-realization, you should learn to control your outer and inner behavior.\nA storm of anger extinguishes the flame of peace, in whose light alone you can\nbehold the Spirit.\n\nSelfish anger is bad, but righteous indignation may be good, in the proper\ncircumstances. Greed for gold is selfish and creates universal poverty by\ntaking money away from unwary people who may need it. Greed for constant\nmeditation, or God-communion, is good. To fear evil actions or the influence\nof bad habits is good, and to fear to do wrong is good. Therefore, we see that\nsometimes what is really bad appears to be good, and what is really good\nappears to be bad.\n\nOvereating, wrong eating, and being under the spell of greed should be\navoided. Overeating destroys mental freedom and keeps the soul body-con-\nscious during meditation. You should try to be prosperous financially without\nbeing greedy for money to the extent that you forget the honest way of living.\n\nYou should have perfect control over your sex life, so that your reason\nand will power may guide this most powerful instinct, instead of the sex\nimpulse enslaving your volition and judgment. Sex experience in married life\nfor propagating noble children is a proper use of sex, but sex temptation with-\nout self-control completely wrecks peace and destroys inner harmony.\n\nYour body is like an obstinate dog. Leash your mind and body with will\npower, and hold them to the direction in which you want them to move. Do not\nallow them to pull you in the wrong direction and thereby fall into the ditch of\nmisery; whip them when they disobey, for the more you whip them the better\nthey will respond to your commands. Your mind and body have become rebels,\nconstantly protesting to you about the impossibilities in your path; but if you\nwhip them hard, they will hurdle those barriers. So if you know that you are\nprogressing spiritually, mentally, and physically every day, you can be happy;\nbut if you find that you are becoming touchy, finicky, or gossipy, you may know\nthat you are going backward. The best test is to analyze yourself and find out\nwhether you are happier today than you were yesterday. If you feel that you are\nhappier today, then you are progressing; and this feeling of happiness must con- | ।\ntinue.\n\n(To be continued)\n"}

We\nare told of His existence, and we hear His praise in the sermons of professonial\nreligious men and in the voices of saints. We imagine His presence behind the\nveil of beautiful nature. We think about His existence through the logic within\nus. All these windows through which we try to look into God are fitted with\nopaque glass of uncertain inferences drawn from untested, unscrutinized data.\n\nThe surest sign that God exists is the increasing heartbursting joy felt in\nmeditation. When your mind is free from prejudice; when little narrow-minded -\nness vanishes; when you unreservedly sympathize with others and your tears\nflow when they weep; when you hear the one voice of God in the chorus of church-\nes, tabernacles, temples, and mosques; when you realize that life is a joyous\nbattle of duty and at the same time a passing dream or a temporary motion-\npicture performance; and, above all, when you become increasingly intoxicated\nwith the joy of meditation and in making others happy by giving them God-peace,\nyou will know that God is with you always and that you are in Him.\n\nFind Him in the grotto of your heart's silent craving, and you will be able\nto find Him whether you are in the jungles of Hindustan or in the jungles of a\nmodern city where roaring, man-eating tigers of automobiles and fierce trucks\nprowl.\n\n८ ५१८\n>>>\n\nTHE SON WHO LOVED MIRACLES MORE THAN GOD--Part 1\n\nA profound sage lived incognito with his family--a wife, a daughter, anda\nspiritually inclined son. This sage lived in the world, but his consciousness\nwas not of the world; however, he kept his spiritual attainments very well hid-\nden behind a veneer of make-believe worldliness.\n\nThe son, having inherited the exalted qualities of his parent, began spon-\ntaneously to develop a craving for spirituality. The father helped his son only\nae to develop himself, and was careful not to reveal his own real nature\nto the boy. Some spiritual people, who deem God's love as their highest and\nmost sacred possession, keep that love concealed not only from skeptical\nworldly minds, but even from their closest earthly companions.\n\nThe son had no idea that his father was a spiritual master; and this was\npartially because the saint was so near to him and happened to be playing the\nmundane role of afather. In spite of many entreaties to stay home and find God,\nthe son left his family homestead and repaired into the jungly depths of the\nHimalayas in search of a preceptor.

Man is de-\nGOD'S POWER pendent on food because of the sin of ignorance. The soul\n\nidentified with the ignorance-desecrated body feels hunger\nand, in turning to earth products for nourishment, becomes earthbound. Thus\nthe soul forgets that it really lives, like God, by God's cosmic energy.\n\nIt is necessary to correct the wrong thinking of incarnations in order to\nescape the delusions of ignorance and to reclaim our heritage as children of\nGod. Everyone should ask himself each day, as did the blind king in the Bha-\ngavad-Gita: ''Gathered together in the bodily kingdom, the warriors of pre-\nnatal and postnatal good actions are arrayed against the army of prenatal and\npostnatal evil actions. What have they done? Which side has won?\"\n\nEvil on earth was not all created by man's wrong actions accumulated dur-\ning many incarnations. Evil existed from the time the cosmic satanic force\n(Satan) first misused the cosmic energy of God to create imperfect creatures\nand objects.\n\nSatan had been an archangel to whom God gave independent power to cre-\nate perfect finite things, even as He did. Satan misused his God-given inde-\npendence. As a rebellious general might turn against his king, Satan turned\nagainst God by creating ugly counterparts for all the beautiful creations of God,\nboth in the microcosm of man's body, mind, and soul, and in the macrocosm\nof the physical, astral, and causal worlds.\n\nTnere was no evil in God. Satan precipitated evil by his misuse of God-\ngiven free choice and the power of creating finite things. Satan foresaw that\nif Adam and Eve remained perfect in their thoughts and actions while on earth,\nthey would follow God's plan and be dematerialized and drawn back into Him.\nIf Adam and Eve (who symbolically stand for the entire race of perfect human\nbeings originally created by God) could not be tempted to transgress God's\nperfect laws and thus become earthbound, there would be nothing further for\nSatan to do; he would lose his independent power to create because everything\nwould melt back into Spirit.\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 459, "text": "S-3 P-54 3\n\nGod might have anticipated through His omniscience the origin of evil by\nSatan; but He organized this cosmic play in order to enjoy Himself through His\nmany selves, knowing that His goodness would ultimately attract all things\nback unto Himself. The Lord has arranged it so that the souls He has created\ncan never be really happy until they are reunited with Him.\n\nGod created a beautiful human body that was meant to be charged by cos-\nmic energy and to live in a free, unconditioned, divine state; Satan counter-\nacted by creating hunger, and the lures of the other physical senses. To usurp\nman's mental power Satan substituted mental temptations. To combat the\nsoul's wisdom Satan invented delusive ignorance. To offset all that is beauti-\nful in nature Satan creates ugly warfare, disease germs, earthquakes, cata-\nclysms, floods, and other disasters.\n\nIf there were no individual greed, selfishness, false ambition, or sex ad-\ndiction, this earth would be free from physical and moral crimes and war. By\nprecipitating these misfortunes, Satan is systematically fighting God's perfect\nplans of unselfishness, international cooperation, self-control, and true ambi-\ntion--ambition that seeks, above all, to please God, and then includes the hap-\npiness of other people in one's own happiness.\n\nSPIRITUAL The undeveloped spiritual aspirant may think of heaven as a\n\nPERCEPTION place of glorified earthly enjoyments. When such a devotee\n\nsits quietly meditating, peering into the darkness of closed\neyes, he begins to wonder if it is not foolish to relinquish the tangible plea-\nsures of the senses for the invisible pleasures of the Spirit. But the conscious-\nness of the spiritual aspirant who sleeplessly meditates, becomes reidentified\nwith the soul and is saturated with bliss. According to the quality of his ad-\nvancement, such a devotee is able to centralize his spiritual perception on any\n\nplane.\n\nIn the chariot of his spiritual perception he is able to flee the wilderness\nof the misery-flaming senses. Passing through the oases of the various cen-\nters of consciousness in the spine, he ultimately reaches the highest plane of\nconsci ousness in the brain. He beholds his chariot of spiritual perception sit-\nuated exactly between the crooked sense tendencies and the straight and narrow\nroad of discriminative tendencies.\n\nA superficially happy but restless man, working and worrying daily to\nmake money, does not know of the superior joy of meditation, so he does not\nlike to meditate. He would rather consume precious hours to no purpose than\nto give any time to seeking superior, ever-new joy in meditation.\n\nMost people, not knowing the positive side of renouncing habitual restless-\nness in order to find higher happiness. give up meditating after a few trials;\nthey plunge back into the eddies of ordinary habits of living and are drowned in\nignorance.\n"}

'' Sincere aspirants should\nuse spiritual imagination to realize the value of meditation.\n\nDiscouraged devotees should remember that no matter how many times\none suffers from powerful attacks of sense habits and restlessness-producing\ndesires, the meditation-born occult soldiers of his present and past lives will\ncome to the aid of him who keeps on meditating with faith.

No matter what you may be doing, you are always\nfree to whisper your love to God, until you consciously receive His response.\nThis is the surest way to contact Him in the mad rush of present-day life.\n\nWhenever you want something very much, no matter what you may be do-\ning or where you may happen to be, a mentally whispering desire for the ob-\nject constantly revolves in the background of your mind. Far from being par-\nroted prayers, such mental whispers are spontaneous and secretly work them-\nselves into a dynamic power. | |\n\nNever be satisfied until you see unmistakable signs of divine response.\nWithout being discouraged, keep on meditating and praying ever increasingly.\nGod will come to you as Jesus, or Lahiri Mahasaya, or any other of the Great\nMasters, as they actually appeared when they lived on earth. While praying,\nremember that no matter if God does not answer you, He is listening to you;\nand if you can convince Him that you want Him above all else--as badly as you\nmay have wanted money, love, or power--then He will talk to you.\n\nRemember, a mother does not come in answer to the cry of the child who\nis easily consoled by toys, but she comes to the incessantly crying, naughty\nbaby. Become the naughty baby of the Divine One. Do not be satisfied with a\n\"demonstration\" of earthly toys in answer to your prayercries.

God, the Supreme\n\nSoul, is omnipresent, and the cosmos is His body. Man's\nsoul, made in God's image, has in it the seed experience of omnipresence.\nThis consciousness of omnipresence is hidden in the soul just as the conscious-\nness that creates a tree is secreted ina small seed. That seed planted in prop-\ner soil brings forth a tree, and, similarly, the soulseed of intuitive realization\nplanted in the soil of proper meditation will manifest the omnipresent conscious-\nness.\n\nA man whose consciousness is on the mundane plane is preoccupied with\nphysical wants and needs; in this cramped environment his consciousness does\nnot extend beyond the gates of his own bodily home. The spiritual man, through\nthe spreading light of meditation-born sympathy, learns to feel the woes and\npains of others; he realizes that the world, indeed, the cosmos, is his home.\n\nThe constant sight of the body causes the mind to think of itself as confined\nin the flesh. Meditation upon the Infinite, as it grows deeper, makes the med-\nitator, meditation, and the object of meditation One. This experience convinces\nthe mind that it is not circumscribed by the body, but is in everything. The mind,.\nmeditating upon the Infinite, becomes unlimited. Meditation is the art of trans-\nferring the attention from the finite (the little body and the relatively small por-\ntion of space in which mortals live) to the Infinite.\n\nBRAIN IS THE Every human brain is a storehouse of life force. Through\nSTOREHOUSE it dance radiant waves of energy, electric in character. Just\nOF LIFE FORCE as water in a cup that is suddenly jolted spills over, so the\n\nenergy waves in the brain tend to splash out if the head sus-\ntains a hard blow. At such times one may see sparks of light or ''stars, '' which\nare simply flashes of energy.\n\nThis brain energy is constantly being used up in muscular movements; in\nthe working of the heart, lungs, and diaphragm; in cellular metabolism and chem-\nicalization of the blood; and in the activity of the telephonic sensory-motor sys -\ntem of the nerves. Besides this, a tremendous amount of brain energy is | ।\nrequired in thinking, feeling, and willing.\n\n"}

Just as a radio\nwith a run-down battery fails to work, so the brain, if lacking in energy, also\nfails to work as a thought-receiving and thought-transmitting radio. The human\nbrain equipped with the energy of life force is meant to transmit or receive\nthoughts in the same way that messages are exchanged by radio. The time is\napproaching when radiotelegraphy will be put into the discard, for man will be\nable to communicate instantaneously through the radio of his brain.\n\nAll of us have at times had ''hunches'\"'--that is, our mind radio becomes\nmysteriously tuned in with the thoughts of others, or with the vibratory pattern\nof an impending event floating in the ether of Cosmic Consciousness. Occasion-\nally, when we continuously and very deeply want others to know certain of our\nwishes, those persons do become aware of them: their brain radios ''receive\"'\nour messages.\n\nNow the question is: If occasionally the human mind can receive thoughts\nfrom or transmit them to another mind without the medium of ordinary com-\nmunication methods, why could not human mental radios be so tuned as to\nreceive or broadcast thought messages at will?\n\nKEEP YOUR A radio broadcasting or receiving mechanism cannot con-\nMENTAL RADIO duct messages when out of order.

The heart,\nwhich is the center of feeling, and the mind, which is the center of reason, must\nbe one-pointedly concentrated in order for your mind-radio message to reach\nGod, and for you to receive His answer.\n\nThe longer and deeper you meditate and pray to Him, the more deeply you\nwill feel and be conscious of the expanding joy in your heart.

For example, a certain combina-\ntion of visual, auditory, tactual, and olfactory perceptions is called an orange;\nno one knows what an orange is in essence. It 18 not the color, nor the taste,\nnor the softness, but the intelligent force that combines these qualities harmoni-\nously to produce the effect of an orange. Even if one were able to reproduce\nsynthetically the properties of the orange--its color, taste, softness, etc., --\nwell enough to fool the senses, one would still not have produced a real orange,\nand one would still not know what an orange really is. Although our senses do\nnot tell us what the real orange is, our reason suggests that perhaps it is an\nintelligent combination of certain differently vibrating atoms representing color,\ntaste, solidity, and smell, around one nucleus.\n\nThe vast material universe is nothing but an ocean of energy lying about us:\nhigh overhead as rivers of milky ways, twinkling stars, solar systems; beneath\nour feet as solid earth. The physical body with its ethereal thoughts, the spark-\nling lakes, heaving oceans, sky, air, and fire--all are but vibrations of one\nCosmic Energy.\n\nYet the senses differentiate and tell us the delusive story that solids hurt us,\nliquids drown us, fire burns us, air will not support us, and gas chokes us. As\nthe solid substance we call ice appears from water, steam, or hydrogen-oxygen\ngas, so the solid earth with its oceans and vapors appears out of the universe of\nCosmic Energy.

Each speck of dust\nwould appear as a rolling mass of light.\n\nIt is true that, though our senses deceive us, our power of reason can help us\nto discover the truth about various things. But it is well to remember that knowl-\nedge derived from experiments carried on with the help af mathematics, micro-\nscopes, and so on has to come through the senses; and that the senses tell only a\ntiny part of the truth about the nature of matter; hence reason working on the testi-\nmony of the senses can be led astray. Only yesterday atoms were considered ulti-\n= they have been further analyzed and found to contain finer materials;\nelectrons and protons, neutrons, and so on. Therefore neither the senses nor the\npower of inference that builds knowledge on sense testimony can be trusted to tell\nus the truth about the universe, our earth, the human body, or the mind.

As soon as he is through, he swings back to the center of\ncalmness. You should always be calm, like the pendulum that is still, but ready\nto swing into steady action whenever necessary.\n\nActivity should be under the control of your calmness. If instead your calm-\nness is at the mercy of your activity, you may make your mark in the world, but\nyou may also find that you are unable to use that success or prosperity. It is best\nto be calmly active and actively calm, a Prince of Peace sitting on a throne of\npoise, directing the kingdom of your activity. Calmness should not act as an opiate\nto dull your activity. Always be ready to be active, but carry calmness with you\ninto your activity.\n\nCalmness is one of the attributes of the immortality within you. You area\nprodigal son when you worry; there is static coming through your mind radio. God's\nsong is the song of calmness. Nervousness is the static; calmness is the voice of\nGod speaking to you through the radio of your soul. Nervousness is the handmaiden\nof change and death; when you are calm, even death cannot frighten you, for you\nknow you are a god.

First of all seek to remove\nthe cause of anxiety without permitting the situation to\n\ndistress you. Do not daily feed your mind with fresh poisonous fears that\n\nyou yourself create.\n\nCertain types of worries are the result of attempting to do too many\nthings hurriedly. You should not \"bolt'' your mental duties of thinking out the\nright solution to life's various problems; they should be thoroughly masti-\ncated, one at atime, with the sharp teeth of keen attention, and saturated\nwith the saliva of good judgment. Thus you may avoid worry indigestion.\nConsult a specialist in spirituality. If the disease of spiritual ignorance is\nfound to be chronically present, be guided entirely by him. The teachings of\na true guru will help you to cure yourself of spiritual ignorance, which is the\nroot cause of all other ills. One's judgment may be affected by a state of\nmental ill health, so the guidance of such a spiritual specialist is needed to\neffect a permanent healing.\n\nGO ON A \"WORRY FAST\" Whenever you make up your mind not to worry,\n\nbut to go instead on a fast from worry, stick\nto your resolution. You can stop worrying entirely. You can calmly solve\nyour most difficult problems by putting forth your greatest effort, and at the\nsame time absolutely refusing to be disturbed. Say to yourself:\n\n\"I can do only my best; no more. Iam satisfied and happy\nthat Iam doing my best to solve my problem; there is\nabsolutely no reason why I should worry myself to death. ''\n\nWhen you are fasting from worry, you need not be in a negative mental\nstate. Drink copiously of the fresh waters of peace flowing from the springs\nof every good circumstance, vitalized by your determination to take a posi-\ntive attitude. If you have made up your mind to be cheerful, nothing can make\nyou unhappy. If you do not choose to destroy your own peace of mind by\naccepting the suggestion of unhappy circumstances, no one can make you de-\njected. You are concerned only with the untiring performance of right actions\nfor right results; but your whole attention must be on the actions and not on\ntheir results. Leave the latter to God, saying: ''Il am happy in the knowledge\n\n"}

At 7 o'clock in the morning say to yourself:\n11.411 my worries of the night are cast out, and from 7 to 8 a.m. I refuse to\nworry, no matter how troublesome are the duties ahead of me. Iam going to\nfast until 8 o'clock without worry.'' From 12 to 1 p.m. say: \"Iam cheerful,\nI will not worry.\"\n\nIn the evening, between 6 and 9 o'clock, particularly if you must be in\nthe company of hard-to-get-along-with relatives or friends, mentally make a\nstrong resolution and say: ''Within these three hours I will not worry; 1 re-\nfuse to become vexed, even if my patience is tried. No matter how tempting\nit is to indulge in a worry feast, I will resist. I have allowed worries to make\nme upset and sick and now my heart of peace has suffered from worry attacks.\nWhy should I paralyze and perhaps kill my peace-heart by shocks of worries?\nI cannot afford to worry. I resolve to fast from worry.\"\n\nAfter you succeed in carrying out such fasts during certain hours of the\nday, try it for a week or two weeks at a time, and then try to prevent the\naccumulation of worry poisons in your system entirely. Whenever you find\nyourself indulging in a worry feast, go on a partial or complete fast from\nworry for a day or a week.\n\nHOPE AND JOY-- Hope is the eternal light held aloft by the soul as man\nCURE FOR WORRY travels the pathway of incarnations to reach God.\n\nNever relinquish hope; for you would then have to\nwait miserably in darkness, unable to resume your journey toward the Divine\nuntil you chose to raise once again your searchlight of hope.\n\nMost people hope and try for a while, but if they fail more than a few\ntimes they cease to hope and become despondent. The divine man never\nceases to hope, for he knows that he has all eternity in which to materialize\nhis dreams.\n\nTo kill hope and be despondent is to put on a mask of animal limitation\nand to hide your divine identity with the Almighty. Hope for the highest and\nthe best, for nothing is too good for a child of God. Keep on hoping. Move\nin that light of hope until you finish your travels through pathways of incar-\nnations and reach your luminous home in God. Hope comes from the intui-\ntive consciousness of the soul that some time or other we shall remember it\nas our true identity--the forgotten image of God within us.\n\nAbstaining from worry is a negative method of overcoming worry poison-\ning; there are also positive methods. If you are infected with the germs of\nworry you should go ona strict mental diet. You should feast regularly on\nthe society of joyful minds. Every day you should associate, if only fora\nlittle while, with joy-instilled persons--those who meditate and feel the joy\n"}

Feast on laughter in the company of these really joyful people. @\nSteadfastly continue your laughter diet once you have begun it, and at the end\n\nof a month or two you will see the change--your mind will be filled with sun-\n\nshine. Remember, specific habits can be cultivated only by specific habit-\n\nforming actions.\n\nCOURAGE DIET Once you have practiced and felt the benefits of fasting\n\nto eliminate worry, try going on a courage diet for\ncertain hours, days, or weeks, to rid the mind of fear. Assimilate all you\ncan of thoughts of your soul invincibility.\n\nWISDOM DIET In order to destroy ignorance, go on a wisdom diet.\n\nDrink the tonic of wisdom with the lips of intuition. You\ncan learn from the intuition of your soul whenever you seek her out in the\n[41 of deep meditation. Read good books of a devotional and spiritual\nnature, taking from them what wisdom you need. You must live a pure life to\nbecome spiritually impregnated with your true soul qualities of wisdom, fear-\nlessness, peace, and love.\n\nHOW TO ROUSE The minutes are more important than the years. If\nGOD AND RECEIVE you do not fill in the minutes of your life with thoughts\nHIS RESPONSE of God, the years will slip by and when you need Him\n\nmost you will not be able to feel His presence. But\nif you do fill in the minutes of your life with the thoughts of God, you will find\nthat the years of your life automatically will be saturated with the conscious-\nness of God. Never think of tomorrow. Take care of today and all the to-\nmorrows will take care of themselves. Do not wait until tomorrow to medi-\ntate. Do not wait until tomorrow to be good. Be good now! Be calm now!\nIt will be the turning point of your life.\n\nThe man who aspires to expand himself into the all-pervading God Con-\nsciousness must learn to meditate upon God's omnipresence in the Cosmos.\nMeditation means constant thinking of God's presence within and without, so\nthat the soul may lose its attachment to the human body and remember its\nvast body--the Cosmos. The Spirit ocean knows that it has become the soul\nwaves, but the soul waves need to recall by meditation that they are the\nSpirit ocean. The little soul wave must forget its mental idea of smallness,\nborn of concentrating upon the body, and must concentrate upon the Cosmic\nSpirit as its own big body, in which the little human body is just a part.\n\nLike the great yogis of India, Jesus not only could foretell through tele-\npathic vibrations, or thought, the actions of people and the course of events\nfrom a distance; he also knew about all the happenings on the earth's surface\nor within it, or in any portion of space, or in any planet of vibratory crea-\ntion--through his omnipresent feeling. That is how Jesus foretold the early\ndeath of Lazarus; he felt it in his own omnipresent Christ Consciousness.\n\n"}

'!\n\nAnd to the maiden he would say: ''My daughter, in selecting your mate,\nchoose one who is strong and bravehearted like the lion, faithful like the dog,\nhome-loving like the pigeon, and wise like the elephant.\"\n\nIf the priest were asked to give advice as to the suitability of the match\nfrom the standpoint of character analysis, he would talk in a friendly way with\nboth the boy and the girl, and then talk intimately with each of them alone.\nAfter that he would meditate many times about the matter. And finally, he\nwould give his conclusions to the parents. And these conclusions would have e\na substantial foundation, for he would judge not only by the physical appear- @.\nance and expression, but also by the aura, which only a spiritual adept can\ndistinguish clearly enough to read without making mistakes. Tnis kind of anal-\nysis is an art and must be learned scientifically, just as arithmetic must be\nstudied and practiced if one wishes to become a mathematician.\n\nIn the West, people prefer to make an independent choice in seeking a\nmarriage partner. Before deciding on a life companion, however, one should\nunderstand the different impulses that may affect and influence one's selection.\n\nFORCES OF ATTRACTION\n\n1. Call of physical attraction. 6. Call of idealism.\n\n2. Call of aesthetic attraction. 7. Call of emotional liking.\n3. Call of mental unity. 8. Call of material greed.\n4. Call of vocational likeness. 9. Call of social position.\n5. Call of moral inclination. 10. Call of the soul.\n\nMany young couples marry because they are drawn together by a certain\nsimilarity of mental traits. While mental harmony is one of the indications of\nproper mating in matrimony, it is not everything. Mental unity may wear off\nif there is no inner unity of mutual soul harmony.\n\nOne young man says of his fiancee: 'I like her because she enjoys watching )\n\n"}

In\nmodern times it is extremely helpful to have a wife who is interested in the\ndevelopment of one's profession or business and a wrong choice can be detri-\nmental to one's profession. For instance, doctors and lawyers should not wed\nsuspicious persons who would be jealous of their patients and clients.\n\nFor the most part, youthful couples marry because they are attracted by\ngood looks, but as a rule those who have married only for beauty have soon\nparted. After the infatuation produced by beauty wanes, a beautiful face may\neven appear ugly. What people get, they often do not want; what they want,\nthey often do not get. Of course, personal beauty has its place in the plan of\nlife, but greater than physical beauty is mental beauty. Men and women who\nare adorned with the soul qualities of purity, sweet speech, wisdom, and un-\n\n` ` ending, unconditional tove, exercise a lasting magnetic hold on their mates.\n\nSome men would like to marry a rich widow and some poor girls or widows\nwould like to choose a rich bachelor or widower; but marriage for money alone\nnever lasts and usually ends in the merited accusation: ''You married me for\nmy money.'' Those who want money should go into business and earn it; they\nshould never try to 'get rich quick'\"' through marriage. There is a long life of\nhumiliation in store for the man who marries a woman for her money, and\nwomen do not find the gratification they expect from marrying for wealth. One\nsuch wife told me: \"I married a rich man all right, but he is the worst hus-\nband; he beats me whenever I spend money, even for bare necessities.\"\n\n—— a few persons marry for social position. Some American girls go to\n\nEurope primarily to meet and marry sophisticated dukes, counts, or princes,\nbut most of these marriages are failures. Don't try to climb into society\nthrough marriage. Gain money and fame by developing your usefulness and\nyou will automatically attract social prominence. Don't try to become famous\nby sharing the halo of somebody else's fame.\n\n"}

Under\n\nthe influence of emotion, some couples not only elope, but want to add to the\n\nintoxicating excitement :by getting married in an airplane or in some other un-\n\nusual manner. High school boys and girls often marry under the influence of\n\nsuch emotions. Others want to get married just for the thrill of tasting for-\n\nbidden fruit. One rich girl I know of ran away with the family chauffeur. But\n\nthe attraction was based solely on the excitement of a clandestine romance,\n\nand right after the honeymoon, when the thrill of resisting her father's will\n\nwas over, the heiress fled from her husband.\n\nTwo American couples once seriously suggested that I marry them while\nwe all plummeted down in parachutes from 15,000 feet above sea level.

Not only do the senses mislead the romantically inclined;\nthey also beset the path of every seeker of Self-realization. For the devotee,\nin trying to delve deep into soul happiness, is often suddenly possessed by his\nsubconscious habitual love for sense pleasures. At such times all the golden\nhope of eternal happiness pictured by the inner wisdom seems suddenly lack-\nluster and useless, and the devotee thinks:. \"If I have to forsake tangible earth-\nly happiness now, there is no use in gaining anything spiritually, no matter\nhow beautiful the promise for the future. '' The devotee, in extreme sympathy\nwith sense pleasures, then begins to think: \"I would rather go unarmed--with-\nout self-control and the power of resisting evil--and let my spiritual happiness\nbe slain by the weapons of temptation, than be involved in a devastating battle\nbetween the discriminative forces and sense pleasures. '' That was Arjuna's\ntemptation, about which he sought the advice of Sri Krishna, as described in\n\nthe Bhagavad-Gita.\n\nNo devotee should hide behind the mask of false reasoning and try to de-\nceive and intimidate his soul by the foolish fear of renouncing first-arrived,\ntangible, inferior sense-pleasures for superior, to-be-achieved, but yet-to-\nbe-acquired soul bliss. Every devotee, instead of being despondent, should\nbe glad to consign inferior pleasures to limbo in order to gain the unending\njoy of the soul.\n\nThe devotee who has learned the techniques of salvation from his guru, or\ndivine preceptor, no longer wishes to be attached to worldliness and thus re- @\nmain a slave of destiny, continuously experiencing the dualistic fluctuations of\n"}

Saints and prophets have begged people to love God be-\ncause He can be useful to them in a way that no one else can be. We want\nHim because He is the Redeemer of all forms of mortal ills and suffering and\nthe Giver of eternal joy. One who does not love his fellow beings cannot love\nGod, or feel divine love.\n\nAlthough love is born in human relations and thrives on the law of mutual\nfree from all conditions, or the law of mutual usefulness.

You want to be sure that your\nmarriage will be happy and enduring. Physical attraction alone is not a true\nbasis for such assurance. Many youthful couples, blinded by physical attrac-\ntion, fall in love and marry. Later, when the fire of emotion has died down\nand they are able to see each other's true personality dispassionately, they\nare frequently disillusioned and seek divorce. Those who do not learn from\nsuch an experience may even make the same kind of mistake all over again\nwith another mate. Wisdom and discrimination are necessary in choosing\nmarriage partners. Those who rely on physical attraction alone as a guide\nusually end up flying back and forth like shuttlecocks between the marriage\nbureau and the divorce court.\n\nWhen husbands and wives, owing to deterioration of moral standards, lose\nmutual respect, they cease to love each other. Moral turpitude crumbles away\nthe cementing bond of love between them. Young people who continuously\nstrengthen and develop their moral standards after marriage will most likely @\nremain married. Mutual regard will develop out of such moral emulation and\nwill strengthen the bond between them.\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 489, "text": "8-3 P-59 3\n\nDEVELOP LOVE Sometimes couples with lofty spiritual ideals marry\nFOR TRUE IDEALS’ with the thought that together they will preach, teach,\n\nand reform other people. And it sometimes happens\nthat one gains more prestige with followers than the other, and the mate be-\ncomes jealous. Such unhappiness may be avoided if both partners concentrate\non manifesting their common ideals, rather than on comparing the results of\ntheir work.\n\nMarried couples that strive to develop their love for true ideals equally in\neverything will find their love for each other increasing more and more, until\nit burns in their hearts as a single divine flame. The husband or wife who\ndesecrates his own ideals may lose the love of an idealistic mate. The spring\nof idealism on which love feeds must not be allowed to dry up. Married cou-\nples should never cease striving to be more idealistic in their thoughts and\nactions toward family, society, country, and the world. Thus will they find\ntheir love ever growing and changing and expanding, until it becomes purified\ninto unconditional divine love.\n\nSEEK Young people planning marriage should pray deeply to God to\nCOMPLETE be guided aright. Meditation and sincere prayers will bring\nUNITY divine response in major and minor ways, developing the rela-\n\ntionship between the girl and boy by creating various circum-\nstances and incidents that will afford them an opportunity to judge whether or\nnot their spiritual unity is sufficient to justify a lifelong association. Elope-\nments; or marriages hastily decided upon, are less likely to be successful\nthan those marriages that have been preceded by a waiting period of at least\none year. To enter marriage without due thought is an indication of reckless-\nness and lack of judgment; it invites disaster. Any important step in life is\nworth long consideration; it is worth testing in the fires of daily experiences\nunder varying circumstances.\n\nThe first and most essential requirement for a happy marriage is\nsoul unity--similarity of spiritual ideals and goals, implemented by\na practical willingness to attain those goals by study, effort, and self-\ndiscipline. Couples who possess soul unity will be able to make a\nsuccess of marriage even if no other desirable basis is present.\n\nThe second requirement for a happy marriage is similarity of\ninterest--intellectual, social, environmental, and so on.\n\nThe third, and last in importance (though usually given first place\nby unenlightened people), is physical attraction. That bond soon loses\nits attractive power if the first requirement, or the first and second\nrequirements, are not also present.\n\nA successful marriage is usually owing to the efforts of the wife. By\nshowering love on her husband, by ceaseless service to him, and by daily\nthought for his comfort, convenience, health, and general welfare a woman\ncan make herself indispensable to, and beloved by, the most cantankerous hus-\nband. At the same time she will be hastening her own spiritual evolution,\ntransmuting unlovely egotism into consideration for others--a quality pos-\nsessed by all truly attractive people.\n"}

In soul union, un-\nconditional love between married couples grows deeper and deeper.\n\nThere is a supernatural affinity between kindred souls. A positive and\nnegative current join to light an incandescent lamp; so also a preponderantly\npositive (aggressive) soul combined with a preponderantly negative (yielding)\nsoul are fused into the light of ever-growing love. Soul love must take the\nplace of animal love if marriage is to endure. Soul harmony must be the\nSpring of action in marriage if the partners hope to achieve true happiness.\n\nHOW TO The spiritual way of avoiding mistakes in choosing the right\nAVOID companion is to affirm deeply after deep meditation:\nMISTAKES\n\n\"Heavenly Father, bless me that I choose my life companion\naccording to Thy law of perfect soul union. '!\n\nPractice this affirmation for at least six months, with deep faith. If you\nhave established a real attunement with God through meditation and continuous\naffirmation of this prayer request, you will marry a suitable companion; or,\nif you have been drawn toward one who is fundamentally inharmonious, the\nDivine Father will bring about circumstances that will prevent your making a\nwrong marriage.\n\nDIVINE LOVE Ideal marriages are made only by people who conscientious-\nIN HUMAN ly strive to express divine love through human love. The\nEXPRESSION ideal is difficult to achieve, for most marriages are preced-\ned by only a little true love; physical passion is usually the\npredominating factor. In such marriages sex attraction takes the place of\ntrue unconditional love, which unless cultivated, quickly slips away from the\nheart. If, on the other hand, true love between marriage partners is increased\nby their constant efforts to spiritualize each thought and action, physical con-\nsciousness will decrease, and human love become transformed into divine love.\nAn ideally married husband and wife do not love each other as physical beings,\nbut share a mutual love for God alone. Thus they come to realize that behind\ntheir expressions of love for each other is the purifying divine love of Spirit.\n\nHuman love in marriage (or in any other relationship) does not last unless\nit expresses itself divinely. Without the magnetizing power of divine love,\nmarried couples fail eventually to entertain or to respect one another; and when\nthat happens marriage goes \"67 the rocks. '' Sex charm, intellectuality, beauty,\nmoney, culture, and personal magnetism are not sufficient to keep two persons\ntogether in happy marriage if divine love is not present. Every married man\nor woman seeks perfect love in his or her mate; but it may not be found until\ndivine love is expressed by both partners in all their motives, actions, and । ।\nlife ambitions.\n\n"}

Man's greatest happiness lies in spiritual marriage, union be-\ntween the soul and God. All souls may be said to be negative in relation to\nGod, the positive source of all joy. The soul of man, undergoing the process\nof human evolution in the material world, misses its blissful relationship with\nSpirit; hence the more man seeks to find happiness in the world of matter, the\nmore he feels inharmony and unhappiness. When engrossed in its experiences\nin the physical world, the soul is actually racing away from the sole source of\neternal happiness--God. But when the love-starved, joy-starved, perfection-\nstarved, complete-satisfaction-starved negative soul rejoins the positive,\nall-perfect, all-loving, all-joyful, all-complete, ever-newly blissful God,\nthere results a real spiritual marriage. God is the Bridegroom, and each\nsoul is His bride.\n\nPOWER OF Real magnetism is a drawing, uplifting, expanding power--\nMAGNETISM a quality of the Spirit. Perhaps at some time you have met\na person so magnetic that he inspired you and expanded your\nconsciousness. That magnetic power we all want to enjoy, for it is of the\nSpirit. The consciousness is stupefied by hypnosis or animal magnetism, but\nspiritual magnetism expands the consciousness in a divine way. Mothers who\nhave marriageable daughters should teach them to radiate divinely joyous\nsmiles, and to wear on their cheeks the rouge of sincerity and true love.\n\nMothers should teach their daughters to attract others by spiritual magnetism ——. ----\n\nonly, and to be fully and beautifully dressed with all the genuinely magnetic\nqualities of wisdom, understanding, thoughtfulness, consideration, presence\nof mind, true learning, and all-round efficiency. Spiritual magnetism will\ndraw spiritual persons.\n\nWHEN MARRIAGE Earthly marriage is unnecessary to those who are\nIS UNNECESSARY wedded to the ever-intoxicating Bliss-God. Jesus,\n\nSt. Francis, Swami Shankaracharya, and Babaji\nnever married because they had found perfect love, perfect joy, in the com-\nplete and only perfect mate--God. Hence they had no desire to marry.\n\nTrying to find the divine love of God through spiritualizing the earthly\nmarriage relationship is a delusive and extremely difficult way of seeking Him.\nLovers in the moonlight, under the intoxicating influence of passion and emo-\ntion, promise each other eternal love. And when they die, the moon smiles\nat their skeletons in their graves, and at all the impossible promises they\nmade and failed to keep.\n\nGod's promise to bestow His love on the true devotee is a truly eternal\nvow. God, being immortal, is the only one who can fulfill such a promise,\nHence union with the Cosmic Lord, the only true Beloved, should be the goal\nof each soul. Free from the disappointments that human matrimony may\nBC union with God brings perfect love and eternal fulfillment.\n\n"}

Such experiments should be carried on under conditions conducive\nto natural behavior. Pretense is likely if a person is aware of being \"tested}'\nand judgment on this basis is of no value.\n\nCREATIVE-IMPULSE PLANE Each human being draws friends according\nto the sum total of his or her mental ten-\ndencies accumulated as effects of present\n\nand past actions. If a man has been living primarily on the creative-impulse\n\nplane in the present and in the past, it is likely that he will draw a woman of\nsimilar vibration and vice versa. Like attracts like. Man should never build\naround any woman the vibrations of his lower desires, nor should a woman do\n\nso around a man. One should be able to transmute the creative impulse into\nlove, and to express that pure love toward his prospective life companion. If\none does not learn how to transmute this impulse, he cannot create spiritual\nvibrations ina companion. Your life companion is given to you not merely that\nyou may create on the physical plane, but also that you may create by mind-and-\nsoul-fusions the spiritual children of ideal love, friendship, purity, ideal ex-\nemplary character, noble ambitions, and creative inventions.\n\nLAW OF THE One secret of preserving matrimonial life lies in the\nCREATIVE PLANE ability to exercise self-control.

I am a married man; should my wife and I practice\ncontinence in order to progress spiritually on this path?\"\n\nSelf-Realization Fellowship respects the holy vows of matrimony and up-\nholds the ideal of union in body, mind, and soul for those who enter this\npartnership. It is true that no sensually uncontrolled person has ever real-\nized God, and this pertains to all the senses, not sex only. Promiscuity\nor overindulgence in married life is debilitating physically, mentally, and\nspiritually, and is one of the greatest destroyers of true feelings and love.\n\nBut the wise and controlled use of Nature's creative force -- for the propaga-\ntion of children or the expression of love, one for the other, in the marital\nrelationship ++ can be a beautiful expression of divine love.\n\nThe purpose of Yoga is to bring body, mind, and senses under the control\n\nof the Self, or soul. Because the sexual instinct is one of the strongest\ninstincts in man, second only to self-preservation, it is the force that most\ntenaciously ties man to body-consciousness. The yogis recognized this and\ntherefore urged control -- sublimation, not suppression -~ as one means of\nattaining soul-freedom. Celibacy, therefore, should be practiced by the\nsingle person, for the sexual urge should not be abused for mere sense grat-\nification.\n\nModeration, with the cultivation of love uppermost in the consciousness,\nshould be the goal of those who unite themselves before God in the holy vows\nof marriage. While Self-Realization Fellowship does not teach that one should\npractice continence in marriage, a gradually decreasing need for sensual grat-\nification may come naturally to married couples on this path. As the love\nbetween husband and wife deepens in a common love for God, the Source of all\nlove, the fulfillment they feel in their relationship toward one another be-\ncomes all-satisfying and outgrows baser expressions. In this regard the most\nimportant thing is the sacredness of the marital vows taken, and the duty\ntherein of each partner to make the marriage a life of fulfillment, one for\nthe other. Any move toward greater self-control or abstinence should only be\nmade with the natural readiness and consent of both partners.\n\nThere are many things taught in the scriptures that express ways to find\nGod more quickly.

Unless married couples keep in mind\nthe true high purpose of marriage, they may never enjoy a really happy life\ntogether. Oversexuality, too much familiarity, lack of courtesy, suspicious-\nness, insulting speech or acts, arguing before children or guests, crankiness,\nand unloading of troubles or anger on one's mate should be disallowed if mar-\nriage is to be ideal. True marriage is a laboratory in which poisons of self-\nishness, bad temper, and bad behavior may be poured into the test tube of\npatience and neutralized and changed by the catalytic power of love and con-\nstant effort to behave nobly.\n\nAn indifferent husband chills the warm affection of the wife, and an inatten-\ntive wife makes the husband callous. Courtesy in remembering birthdays and\nother important days and in reviving old reminiscences of affection should be\ncontinued throughout life. A small flower presented with love, or a word fra-\ngrant with kindness, can do much to patch up old wounds. Put on your best\ndress-suit of kindness and proper behavior with your mate and children first,\nat home. Eventually you will win everybody you meet by your magnetic aura\nof kindness.\n\nIt is not necessary to agree about everything in order to be kind; but when\ndisagreeing, one should always remain calm and courteous. To become angry\nand scold is a human weakness. But the man or woman who is able to hold\nthe reins over the wild steeds of temper and speech shows divine strength. No\nmatter what may be the provocation to anger and harsh words, behave your-\nself. By calm silence or by genuine kind words, show that your kindness is\nmore powerful than the other person's ugliness. In the mellow light of divine\nforgiveness the cumulative darkness even of years of hatred will melt away.\n\nWHAT TO DO If you are already married, but mismated, try to make the\nIF MISMATED best of the situation if possible. If for the sake of children,\nor for some other reason, you and your partner want to\nremain together, try to overcome your mental shortcomings and differences,\nand let your understanding triumph. Those who can do so will have learned\nthe best lesson in the art of right behavior and the magnetic way of getting\n\n"}

A man who can conquer a nagging wife by diplomacy, with-\nout becoming 'henpecked, '' can win anyone to his side. A woman who can con-\nquer an unfaithful husband by forgiving, unfailing, silent love and by continu-\ning demonstrations of kind, firm activity, can remain always in an impregna-\nble castle of happiness.\n\nIf a woman loves her husband, she must forgive all his faults, even un-\nfaithfulness, and should give him sufficient time to recover from his inner\nweakness by unceasingly pouring out the balm of her unwavering love. Most\nwives add the chili sauce of burning words and unkind acts to the remorse-\nwounds of the inwardly penitent, erring husband. Open rebellion results.\nMisunderstandings should not be allowed to grow to the point of bursting into\npoisonous ugliness. A wronged wife should mentally hint, by her increasing-\nly loving attitude, that she wants her husband to be healed. When a man is\nwrong, and he knows that he is wrong, he hates to be told that he is wrong;\nhe resents being labeled, so he rebels.\n\nAVOID HARSH SPEECH Those who would get along peaceably with their\n\nmates should refrain from harsh speech; a husband\nwho wants his wife to stop using unpleasant language should control his own\ntongue first. Harsh words never stop harsh words. Do not make the one that\nyou have to live with hate you. Ungoverned emotion results in divorce and\nsometimes even in violent death. The way of wisdom lies in silently correct-\ning one!s_own faults and in removing all the causes-that.give rise to unkind\nwords, quarrels, and hateful feelings between marriage partners.\n\nThose unhappily married persons who want the Heavenly Father to show\nthem the way out of their difficulties should by all means make up their minds\nto be kind in thought, word, and deed, even though they may have decided to\nseparate. Above all, each marriage partner should make up his mind not to\nbe ugly and hateful and rough in speech just because his or her mate is so.\nWhoever abhors ugliness in his mate should not allow a similar mental squa-\nlor to soil his own words, actions, or thoughts. Why should two who have to\nlive together annoy each other with increasing misunderstandings? It is bet-\nter to seal one's lips; stop unkindness in thought, action, and speech; and win\nover one's mate by silently offering abiding kindness, and by showing sincere\ncourtesy in every action.\n\nThose who must part should do so in kindness; a wronged wife, for ex-\nample should let an erring mate inwardly acknowledge and repent of his\nfaults rather than openly denounce him. She should write a loving letter ex-\npressing the following ideas: ''Very dear one, we loved each other once. Let\nus remember that love again; and since we entered into a marriage partner-\nship in goodwill and with good intentions, and since we failed to make our\nmarriage a success, let us part in kindness and in the memory of that old\nlove. Iam leaving in order to preserve my kind thoughts of you forever, for,\nin the vault of memory, I shall ever hold our past love as deeply sacred. \"'\n"}

Sometimes a thought runs in the mind and the\nOR \"TOUCHY\" nerves rebel against it. Even if there is good reason\n\nfor being excited, one should not be touchy or become\nemotional. He who controls himself in sucha situation is master of himself.\nIf we are to grow, we must not be touchy or harbor self-pity. Such moods\nonly increase the psychology of being sensitive. An oversensitive person\nfrequently suffers in vain: generally nobody has any idea that he has a griev-\nance, much less what itis. It is best therefore to remove by self-mastery\nthe cause that produces such sensitiveness.\n\nOne should be able to control his moods instantly. To let the fire of\nsensitiveness eat into one's heart, and to keep it smoldering there, will burn\naway the fibers of inner peace. A wise person controls his sensitivity, know-\ning that it is nothing but an agency of metaphysical Satan trying to destroy the\nsoul's peace. Whenever a mood of sensitiveness visits the heart, its static |\nprevents you from hearing the divine song of healing peace that plays within\nthrough the radio of the soul. Whenever sensitiveness appears, one should\ntry to conquer the emotion. The person of extreme sensitivity often foolishly\nblames others for the hurt he feels; he should try to understand that his hurt\nis self-inflicted. It is better to blame oneself for being oversensitive than to\nbe angry with others. That is the way to rid oneself of oversensitivity.\n\nCONSTRUCTIVE There are two kinds of criticism: constructive and\n\nAND DESTRUCTIVE destructive. When criticism is administered to those\n\nCRITICISM who resent correction, it may be called ''destructive\ncriticism.

It is not easy to criticize others rightly, accurately,\nand kindly until one can first accurately criticize himself. The art of criti-\ncism consists in picturing clearly the faults of others, and in looking at those\nfaults with a sympathetic attitude, as if they belonged to oneself; only then is\none's criticism justifiable.\n\nMental criticism is worse than criticism by words. It is futile and self-\nharming to be inwardly critical of others. One should cleanse the mind of in-\nwardly disturbing adverse thoughts of others.

Man, who is patterned after Him, is reflected divine\nlove. Human beings were propelled out of God, but He kept His matter-attract-\ned children tied to Him with long invisible strings of love, so that He could\ngradually pull them to Him again. When man is selfish and wicked, forgetful\nof his true love nature, he runs away from God. When he truly and purely\nloves, he automatically and willingly follows the invisible tugging strings of\ndivine love toward God. Though God sent His mortal children far away from\nHim, still He kept the gates of love open so that they might return to His home\nof perfection.\n\nThrough His ever-watchfulness and prophetic sagacity, God foresaw that -\nHis freedom-drunk naughty little children would misuse their liberty; but God\nso loved the world, that He insisted upon becoming the wise father to protect\nhelpless or erring children. Not satisfied with His fatherly calculating rea-\nson He became the mother to love the erring child unconditionally, in the hope\nof making the child use his own free will to repent and return home through\nthe avenue of divine love. He became the child to purify the conjugal love of\nman and woman and expand it beyond the boundaries of two selfish hearts.\nHuman love expands when it flows from two parental hearts into the third\nheart of the child.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that it is necessary to marry in order to\nperfect human love into God's unconditional divine love. Human love may be\nchanged into divine love by the superior way of soul wedlock with the Spirit in\nthe temple of meditation. The soul loves to meditate, for in that lies its\ngreatest joy: communion with the loving Spirit. Hence, all persons who med-\nitate devoutly come to manifest pure love.\n\nRELATION BETWEEN The relation between parents and children is\nPARENTS AND CHILDREN not adventitious, nor merely domestic, nor\ninstinctive; it is a metaphysical, inexorable\nordinance of God.

Mutual regard is the altar of unitedness upon which\nGod's love is manifested.\n\nParents and children should always avoid undue familiarity. They should\nbase their relation not upon force or authority, but upon love. Those who\nfill their hearts with unkindness can never learn to love God, for God is love,\nand true unselfish love is developed at the parental-filial altar of love. The\necho of God's love is drowned out when harshness of speech, unkindness,\nwrath, selfishness and distrust vibrate in the body temple.\n\nRESPONSIBILITY Ideally, parents should look upon each child of theirs as\nOF PARENTS an honored temple wherein their conjugal love will be\nTO CHILDREN purified and expanded into filial love. They should feel\nthat they are serving a little god residing in the infant-\ntemple, and the child should be able to look upon his parents as the visible\nrepresentatives of God on earth.\n\nParents should not angrily scold their children in the presence of others.\nMothers and fathers who are harsh or unkind to their children, owing toa\nlack of self-control, or to bad habits, are hindering God from expanding His\nlove from the parental heart to the heart of the child.

Even if thoughtlessly scolded by\nhis parents before others, a child should never be disrespectful and resent-\nful. Parents and children who thus torment each other persecute the meek,\nthough almighty, God within themselves.\n\nThe child's outer environment in early life is especially important in that\nit can either stimulate or stifle his inner instinctive environment. A child is\nborn with prenatally determined mental tendencies. These are stimulated if\nthe outer environment is like the one that created his inner tendencies; but\nif the outer environment is different, the inner tendencies are likely to be\nsuppressed. For example, an instinctively bad child may be influenced and\nmade good by good company, whereas an instinctively good child placed in\ngood company would, no doubt, increase his goodness. Your outer environ-\nment, in conjunction with your inner tendencies created by old habits of past\nlives, controls your life and molds your tastes and new habits.\n\nCHARACTER BUILDING Children may have either very good or very evil\n\n। tendencies, or they may evince only a slight pre-\nponderance of good or a slight preponderance of evil tendencies. There are\nvery few children who have good and evil tendencies exactly balanced. There\nis always a little less evil than good, or vice versa. The law of nature is that @\nif you are a little less evil than good, your evil will be taken away by the\ngreater power of good; if you have a little less good than evil, your little good\nwill gradually be absorbed by the greater number of evil tendencies, unless\nyou use your will power to counteract these tendencies. If you have more\nevil than good, then you will accumulate still more evil; if you have more\ngood than evil, you will attract still more good by the greater power of good.\nIf you have many evil habits, you will strengthen them by attracting evil unto\nyourself; and if you have very little evil within you, then that little evil will\nbe taken away by the power of your stronger good habits.\n\nThrough reaction to our outer environment fromearly childhood on, our\ninner mental environment is formed. This inner mental environment of\nthought and mental habits forms the tendencies which almost automatically\nguide our actions. If a boy lives where people abhor drink, he forms a dis-\nlike of drink; even if he later goes to live where people drink a great deal,\nhe will remain uninfluenced by it.\n\nWherever you are, remain awake and alert, like good photographers,\nwith your thought, will, perception, and intuition ever ready to take pictures\nof exemplary conduct and to ignore bad behavior.

But to this day I have always listened to reason; when I was wrong, I was\nwilling to be corrected. But when I was right, even if the whole family stood\nagainst me, I remained firm. Mothers, remember to train the will of your\nchildren. When they become self-willed about something that is right, don't\ncallthem bad. Don't curtail their freedom when it is not really necessary,\nbut give suggestions with love and understanding of their own little desires.\n\nIf you try to save time by severely punishing them, you will lose time. Rea-\nson with the child whenever possible and then say nothing. Let him get his\nown little hard knocks and he will then understand and will learn much sooner.\n\nParents often impose their own will on children. When I was a child I\ndidn't like to pray as I was taught, because I didn't understand it. But when\nI learned how to pray with my soul, my family listened respectfully to what I\nsaid. Give freedom to your child and only suggest with love what you think\nis right, because the will power of a child should be developed. The best\nway to do this is to teach the child to meditate. In that way he begins to at-\ntune his will to the divine will, and so his will power develops in the right\nway, by self-control.\n\nAfter the manifestation of mechanical will power in the child, the blind\nwill power of youth begins to manifest. This will power is like a gun that is\nshot off in mid-air. It gives no result except a loud noise. Very young peo-\nple blindly waste the dynamite of will. Then comes the exploding will, when\nthe youth deliberately explodes his will on passions and reckless acts. After\nhe gets a few knocks, he learns again.\n\nParents should help their children to learn from their experiences that\nhappiness is to be found only in self-control--in being the master of one's\nemotions and actions, not their slave.

If you are shy and have stage fright,\n\nget your mind quiet and remember that all the power you need is within you--\nall the power to convince people, all the power to give the direct truth. The\nparticular kind of truth you want to give is in the Infinite Spirit, which functions\nthrough you.\n\nEven the dramatically inarticulate person can learn to talk or play well by\nconstant practice. If one thoroughly rehearses his part and meticulously re-\nmembers it, he should be able to play well on the stage. Even actors with ex-\nceptional ability feel a sort of heart-choking fright immediately before their\nentrance on the stage, not only at the opening performance of a play, but every\nnight of its run. However, when an actor plays a part over and over again,\nevery day for months, he feels at home on the stage and loses stage fright com-\npletely as soon as he begins to speak. Confidence that you would not and you\ncould not even dream of making a fool of yourself before an audience should\nbring to you that self-assurance by which you manage somehow to act well on\nthe stage.\n\nThe quality of your audience and the enthusiasm of your friends can be\ncompared to calves at the udder of the mother cow: the better the calf, the\nmore milk it extracts; the better the audience, the greater the response from\nthe actor. As the milk comes out more and more when the calf pulls harder\nat the udder, so also an appreciative large audience brings out the best in the\nartist. But just as a diseased cow does not give any milk no matter how the\ncalf pulls, so also defective actors cannot produce a worthwhile performance\neven though they may have an appreciative audience.\n\nCAUSES OF STAGE FRIGHT Stage fright is caused primarily by inexperi-\n\nence; secondarily it is due to the lack of mas-\ntery over one's own dramatic technique, or to nervousness, or an inferiority\ncomplex.\n\nStage fright often arises when you are not convinced of your own ability,\nand when your dramatic skill is not stimulated by public appreciation. Great\nartists consider that half the success of the battle is due to perfect technique;\nthe rest is won because of the confidence of the people in the ability of the\nartist.\n\n"}

They are:\n\nLack of frequency in your performances.\n\nTimidity.\n\nNervousness\n\nInferiority complex.\n\nLack of complete mastery over your technique of acting.\nOvereating before a performance.\n\nDrinking, or using narcotics.\n\nNOW PWN ^\n\nHOW TO OVERCOME To let your stage fright get the best of you is ridicu-\n\nSTAGE FRIGHT lous. Just feel you value your honor before your audi-\nence so much that you will not succumb to the influ-\n\nence of stage fright. Conceal every sign of it; act as if you never had it, and\n\ndo your best.\n\nThere are several ways of overcoming stage fright when entering upon the\nstage. For instance, if you are making a speech, try to imagine you are talk-\ning to those who know less about the subject than you do, and hence cannot\ncriticize. Think of them as a group of children or naive adults. Or if you are\non the dramatic stage, imagine you are addressing an empty hall, and just re-\nhearsing your act before an imaginary audience. If you use the above hints,\nyou are bound to get some good results. Success comes by grasping it, and\n\nnot_by just.waiting 07.36. ..... 0-0 ee eee\n\nYou should repeatedly rehearse the dramatic part you are to play until you\ncan act your part autorratically without effort, as oil flows out of a barrel.\nDon't make a great deal of fuss about your acting. Try to play naturally many\ntimes before your own people, at small clubs, in private homes, or wherever\nthere is a chance for you to display your dramatic qualifications, until perfec-\ntion is reached. Then, after you gain the applause of many small groups of\npeople, make your big debut.\n\nSPECIAL EXERCISES Stage fright and timidity come in some degree even\nFOR OVERCOMING to the great artists immediately before a performance,\nSTAGE FRIGHT owing to protracted expectation. ''l am going to have\n\nto impress all those people, ।' one thinks. Then that\nfeeling wears off as the artist merges his ego in the acting. Stage fright and\ntimidity should be supplanted by deep attention, concentration, and calmness\njust before appearing onthe stage. Practice the following:\n\n1. Deep breathing: Breathe deeply a few times, concentrating at the\npoint between the eyebrows, just before the performance. This\nwill remove timidity and insure self-confidence.\n\n९. Mentally rehearse very clearly how masterfully, joyously, and\neagerly you are going to perform and how you are going to\nenthrall your audience.\n"}

Take a bath\na few hours before the performance. If time is limited, wash all | ।\n\nthe body openings with cold water in lieu of a bath.\n\n4. Humbleness is good and magnetic and will draw kind attention and\nsympathy from your audience, whereas pride will cause sneers\nand apathy. An inferiority complex will cause pity, increase any\ndisbelief in your ability, and draw a lack of hearty response. It\nwill put a lid on your powers and prevent their manifesting and\ndoing their duty; it will cause you to underestimate your real abil-\nity and will destroy whatever dramatic faculty you may possess.\nSo, down with an inferiority complex! You should always keep\nhappy and contented just before your debut by maintaining cool\nconfidence in your ability and a conviction that the outcome of your\nperformance will be good, owing to God's working with you. Be-\nfore your entrance, make up your mind to do your very utmost\nto make people appreciate your performance.\n\n5. Get the best teacher to acquaint you with the best technique of acting\nor speaking or singing; and then, with all your inspiration and\nattention, master the technique as your own. Then keep on practic-\ning and improving your tecnnique in rehearsals before a critical\nteacher, in small clubs, and so forth. Don't take criticism to\nheart and become discouraged. Use criticism as a stimulant to\nyour art, removing all the faults in your performance for which\nyou are criticized.\n\n6. Eat very sparingly, say at 2 p.m. for an 8 o'clock performance.\nA stomach loaded with food absorbs some of the power of atten-\ntion that should be used fully in the performance. An artist over-\ngorged with food is conscious of food all through his performance,\nand cannot do justice to his acting. Speaking, singing, or acting\non a full stomach also causes indigestion; it inhibits the vocal\ncords and breath control. The energy and mind, instead of fully\nworking in the vocal cords, become diverted to the stomach\nnerves to perform the work of digestion.\n\nThat is why even in deep meditation a food-loaded stomach inter-\nferes with the attention. In meditation, the energy and mind should\nbe relaxed and sent toward God, and this becomes difficult when\npart of the energy begins to flow toward the stomach to perform\ndigestion.\n\nSleeping when the stomach is full is bad, for some subconscious\nattention and energy try to work on the undigested food. A dis-\nturbed or dream-tortured sleep is the result. The mind and energy @\nwant to rest, and atthe same time they are conscious of their duty\n"}

Hence, rest is disturbed and digestion\ndoes not proceed properly.\n\n7. Drinking or using narcotics drugs the mind, the very machine that\noperates the will, reason, and emotion necessary for good per-\nformances. One should be drunk with inspiration instead of in-\ntoxicants. Inspiration consciously stimulates feeling, will,\nreason, and all the senses to do their best willingly, with the\nfeeling of joy. Intoxicants obliterate consciousness and are dis-\nastrous to real artistic development. Inspiration is very expand-\ning. It is a better motivating force for artistic work than intel-\nlectual watchfulness and meticulous carefulness for an exact tech-\nnical performance. One should be watchful first and then intoxi-\ncated with inspiration, before he performs. To such an artist\nstage fright is a myth.\n\nBut remember, even if you are a great artist, you should practice your\ntechnique with intelligence, inspiration, and God intoxication every day. No\nmatter what you can do, remember that God is the Source and the Flood flow-\ning through all the channels of your powers. Knowing this, try to feel, in\nwhatever good work you do, that God is working through you.\n\nHK AC A\n\nTHINK OF GOD WHILE ACHIEVING\n\nIf a wave suddenly discovered that it is really the ocean, it would see that\nthe ocean temporarily had become its small self, and many other waves as\nwell. So, when you perform every activity with the thought of God, He will\ncome to you and you will realize that He is the Ocean of life which has become\nthe tiny wave of your life, and that you are one with the Ocean. That is the\nactive way of knowing God. Think of God before you achieve, while you are\nachieving, and after you have achieved. Then God will reveal Himself.\n\nLet God work through you. That is the best part of devotion. If He is\nwalking through your feet, working through your hands, and feet, and will,\nthen you will know Him. But you must work. You must prefer good activity\nto bad activity, and you must prefer God-reminding activity to any activity\nwithout the thought of Him.\n\nRemember, you are a child of God, one with the Supreme, and when you\nknow that, all things will be added unto you. That is the highest law of God.\n\n\"I made thee free long ago, but thou dost\nnot think so. Dance of death or dance of life,\nknow that these dualities come from Me, and\nrejoice. What more dost thou want than that\nthou hast Me?'\"!\n"}

Maladies\nthat affect the blood, bones, brain, nerves, and tissues are physical. Men-\ntal disease springs from the invasion of the mental bacteria of fear, worry,\nanger, dissipation, greed, and bad habits. Ignorance of God, or our relation-\nship with Him, is the cause of spiritual disease. It is the sin of all sins,\naccording to the Hindu scriptures, because it is the root from which all other\nmiseries spring. Lack of inner peace, want of harmony with one's fellow\nbeings, and bewilderment about the meaning and purpose of life are some of\nthe spiritual diseases.\n\nBut our concern here is with methods of physical healing. All methods of\nhealing are conditional, and incidental to the existence of disease. Preven-\ntion rather than cure of diseases should be the desire of humanity. Remem-\nber the old story of the Chinese who paid their doctors to keep them well and\nmade the doctors pay the bills if they became sick. A worldwide adoption of\nthis rule would insure great progress in the prevention and healing of physi-\ncal and mental disease.\n\nDEPENDENCE OF What is it that heals? Is it medicine, X ray, massage,\nMAN'S BODY UPON or the mind? If it is any of these, why don't they heal\nCOSMIC FORCES all diseases? Can medicine or mind heal a dead man\n\nof disease? Why not? Because life force is the only\nsupreme, invariable power by which any or all methods of healing can be\nmade effective. A method of healing is inferior or superior insofar as it is\ncapable of rousing or stimulating the inactive life force in any diseased body\npart, thus ''electrocuting'' the disease. All methods of healing are really in-\ndirect ways of rousing the life energy, which is the true and direct healer of\nall diseases.\n\nThe conception of man as a battery that is recharged by an electrical\nforce or prana, as the Hindus call it, is in line with the facts expounded cen-\nturies ago by the sages of India, and is confirmed today by modern scientific\nresearch. It is the life energy, the cosmic electrical force, which cures in\nall cases. An understanding of this point is of far-reaching significance, for\nwhile it will not make a natural diet seem any the less important, it does\nestablish a consciousness in man's mind of the identity of his own life with a\n\n"}

The dif-\nference between a dead body and a living one is the absence or presence of\nthis cosmic life force. Living man is so because life energy sparkles in the\nbulb of the body--in ears, eyes, all the senses and in all the organs such as\nthe stomach, liver, and brain.\n\nThat method which can directly and quickly rouse the life energy to ef-\nfect physical healing Iterm \"life therapy, '' or direct healing by the rays of\nthe inner life force. In all forms of muscular exercise the concentration is\non the muscles and not on the force that moves in the muscles. What is this\nforce moving through the motor nerves into the muscles? What is the force\nin the sensory nerves, carrying sensations of touch, smell, and so forth,\ninto the brain? What is the force that works the pump of the heart, moves\nthe diaphragm, and carries on the process of digestion through the release\nof the digestive juices in the stomach and the peristaltic action of the intes-\ntines? Life energy. It is by concentration on and direction of this dynamic\nlife force, by will, to any part of the body, that healing of disease can be ef-\nfected, and not by concentration on the passive agents upon which the life\n\nALL MATTER Hindu scriptures and ancient Aryan scientist-sages\n\nCHARGED WITH of India long ago promulgated the theory that all\nLIFE BY CONSCIOUS matter was charged with life by conscious cosmic\nCOSMIC RAYS rays. In accordance with this reasoning I main-\n\ntain that the human body is similar to an automo-\nbile battery. Its twenty-seven thousand billion cells are all little batteries,\ndepending upon the principal batteries of the brain, which in turn are re-\ncharged from the medulla oblongata.\n\nJust as an automobile battery depends for its life upon two sources,\nchemicals and an electrical charge, so the body battery depends for its exist-\noe upon two sources:\n\n1. The ''chemicals'\" of food, water, sunshine, and oxygen.\n2. The ''charge\" of life force and consciousness.\n\nThe latter constitute the primary indispensable condition of life, while the\nformer are secondary.\n\nAdding chemicals and water to a dead battery will not revive it. Similar-\nly, if you put a dead man out in the sunshine, stuff his stomach with good food,\nand inflate his lungs with oxygen, still he will not revive. His body battery\nis dead. Although food is one of the essentials of physical existence, life\n\n"}

'' Such a person has never learned to recharge his body\nbattery from within, and has depended only upon external sources for his\nhealth.\n\nChemicals cannot help a dying battery; it cannot function without being\nelectrically recharged. It is electricity reacting on the chemicals that con-\nstitutes the life of a battery. Similarly, a cosmic electrical force is the di-\nrect source of life in man. This power converts food, oxygen, and sunshine\ninto living energy. This force has tremendous intelligence that enables it to\nconvert food materials into different forms of bodily tissue:. osseous, ner-\nvous, adipose, epithelial, and others. Minus life force, food is powerless\nto support life. As mankind advances spiritually and mentally, he will no\nlonger have to rely upon this indirect method of receiving energy by transmu-\ntation of food elements. Tne future food of man will be rays absorbed direct-\nly from within or from nature. :\n\nElectricity and rays are finer in nature than solids or liquids, and there-\nfore a more subtle force for healing. These finer forces affect the electron-\nic constituency of the body and harmonize wrong vibratory conditions, which\nmedicines are too gross to reach. Rays of life energy can penetrate into the\ngerm-disturbed atomic composition of affected cells, where medicinal and\nbody liquids cannot.\n\nWhen Jesus said, 'Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue\nis gone out of me'' (Luke 8:46), he meant by ''virtue'' in this instance the life\nforce. Life energy had gone out of Jesus and electrocuted the disease of the\nperson who touched him. Then he said, to the woman who was healed, ''Thy\nfaith hath made thee whole''(Luke 8:48). That is, she had healed herself by\nautosuggestion. There are various healing methods that can be used, and\ndifferent techniques are given from time to time in these Lessons. In one\nform of healing you will be able to feel the life force in your arms, and learn\nhow to project the current consciously, and with feeling, through your arms\nand hands (Lesson 139). If you can feel the life current in your body when\nyou are directing it toward someone else, naturally you will have greater\nfaith in that healing power.\n\nAnother method of healing follows. First, wrinkle your eyebrows to-\ngether a little, then close your eyes. Think of any person to whom you want\nto send healing power. Concentrate at the point between your eyebrows and\nmentally say: ‘Heavenly Father, I will with Thy will. My will is Thy will.\nWith Thine omnipresent will, O Father, Iwill with all my heart,. with all my\nsoul, that this person be healed.'' While saying this, think that a current is\ngoing through the point between your eyebrows into the point between the eye-\nbrows of the person you are trying to help. Feel that you are sending a cur-\nrent from your spiritual eye into the spiritual eye of the person you wish to\nbe healed.\n\n"}

Feeling this heat is proof that your will power is developing. Con-\ncentrate still deeper. Mentally say: ''With Thy will I send a flash of Cosmic\nEnergy. Father, it is there. '' This should be practiced from fifteen to\ntwenty minutes. While you are doing this, your will power develops; and\nthis developed will power will be with you continuously, no matter what\nhappens, to aid yourself and others when needed.\n\nTHOUGHTS TO LIVE BY\n\nChange your thoughts if you wish to change your circumstances. Since\nyou alone are responsible for your thoughts, only you can change them. You\nwill want to change them when you realize that each thought creates according\nto its own nature. Remember that the law works at all times and that you\nare always demonstrating according to the kind of thoughts you habitually\nentertain. Therefore, start now to think only those thoughts that will bring\nyou health and happiness.\n\nThinking, reading, and repeating statements of truth with deep attention\nwill help to clear away negation and to establish a positive attitude in your\nmind. Repeat your prayers and affirmations with deep concentration until\nyou establish a habit of thought, until it becomes as natural for you to think\nin the right way as it previously was for you to think negatively.\n\nThoughts of fatigue shut off the supply of energy. Cosmic energy,\nthrough the will, feeds the medulla oblongata, which in turn feeds the five\nspinal plexuses. The life force in the plexuses carries on the telephonic\nwork of the five senses through the sensory nerves, and the work of the mus-\ncles and joints through the motor nerves. The same life principle charges\nthe circulation, vitalizes each blood cell, and feeds every nerve, all of\nwhich in turn recharge the other cells of the body. As the cells are but con-\ndensed will and energy, they can be instantaneously renewed by the power of\nyour strong unflinching will. Therefore, you should never say or think that\nyou are tired; by so doing you become twice as tired and paralyze your will\npower, the very instrument that must be active in order to draw cosmic ener-\ngy into your body.\n\nHE EK\nTHE ROSE PLANT OF LIFE\n\nCan we make a half-dead rose plant of life bloom again? The rose usual-\nly dies on the bed of beauty, yet some become worm-eaten and encounter a\npremature ugly death.

Without mind the cells could not exist, just as they could not live\nwithout food. A man kept unconscious, even though artificially fed and exer-\ncised, could not live. So we may say that ordinarily man cannot live (1) with-\nout food and (2) without consciousness. Of course there are exceptional\ncases, for example that of Giri Bala and other saints who live without food;\nand it is known that yogis can live for long periods in sabikalpa samadhi, in\nwhich no outward consciousness is present. But it is true that the average\nman cannot live without food and without exercising his conscious mind. (On\nthis plane the employment of the conscious mind means \"living'' or working\nout the lessons we come on earth to learn. A man in unconsciousness cannot\nbe said to be \"'living.\") | | ।\n\nIf an average man lapses into a coma and remains in a coma for some\ntime, his doctor knows that person's end is near. In occasional exceptional\ncases in which there has been some damage to certain parts of the brain, the\nperson remains in a coma for years; this is because the disease has not af-\nfected any vital area in the brain (the life force is still strong; but the areas\nruling the consci ous mind have been damaged). But such cases are rare;\ngenerally a prolonged lapse into unconsciousness means death.\n\nThe intelligent mind has directed the manufacture of every part of the\nbody--the organs and their involuntary functions, the brain and its activity,\nand so on. Each tissue was made from cells that obeyed the dictates of the\ninstinctive and intelligent mind.\n\nNaturalists have found that crabs and many other forms of life grow anew,\nafter loss, their claws, or other parts of their bodies.

Intime, science should show us how to\nconvert basic cells back into a plastic condition in which they obey the dictates\nof the mind for effecting various changes in the body.\n\nTherefore, the mind, which is the creator, designer, architect, and su-\npreme builder in the body, is the ultimate power to effect healing. The ma-\nterials and parts that make up an automobile are manufactured outside and\nbrought together, but our body parts are all grown from within. The repair\nof an automobile may be accomplished with parts made and purchased else-\nwhere. The repair of an injured body part is brought about almost wholly with-\nin.\n\nMental healing may be classified according to four methods: healing by\nautosuggestion or imagination, by reasoning, by feeling, and by will. The\nnumber of mental healers in the West has increased considerably, and they\nenjoy much success. However, they rarely know their subject--the mind--in\nthe scientific way that a modern and progressive medical man knows his sub-\nject--the physical body. The work of Freud, Jung, and other psychotherapeu-\ntists has been a step toward making mental healing more scientific. A thor-\nough knowledge of both mind and body, and their interdependence, is necessary.\n\nDifferent kinds of mental healing need to be applied to various types of\npersons. Autosuggestion, for instance, has little effect on the logical and\nreasoning type of mind. Howéver, all the methods of healing here described\nmay be profitably used according to the faith and mental and physical habits\nof the patient. There is an order of superiority inthe methods. NHealing by\nmedicine and surgery has its occasional uses, but habitual dependence on\nthese means enslaves the body to drugs and surgical operations; then it will\nalways demand them, instead of relying upon Nature, or God, who is the real\nHealer, and who has established the laws of Nature.\n\nSome persons can rid themselves of disease by reasoning thus: a physi-\ncal sensation can produce pain or a sense of illness only if there is mental\nacceptance of that sensation. For example, a knife cannot produce sensations\nof hurt to the body if the mind is ''absent'' owing to the administration of chlor-\noform; hence that knife-wound pain exists only inthe mind. This thought is\nsufficient to heal disease in those who are strong in mind and discriminative\nreason.\n\nHealing through feeling is accomplished when deep emotion overpowers\nhabit and subconscious suggestions of disease. Many cases have been report-\ned of dumb persons suddenly bursting into speech when their emotions were\nhighly aroused, such as when fire or other danger suddenly confronted them.\nThe stimulation of feeling can override disease consciousness in certain types\nof persons.\n\nMental unwillingness to work is accompanied by listl essness and lack of\n"}

From these facts, we can see the subtle relationship between will and\nenergy. The greater the will, the more inexhaustible the energy. Without\nwilling, we cannot make any motor movement, or even think, for before we\nthink we must will to think. Total unwillingness to work or move or think\nwould cause death very soon. Similarly, death cannot ensue as long as the\n\"will to live''is present. It is only when man, after an exhausting struggle\nwith disease, relaxes the hold of his will on life, that death can conquer. So\nomnipotent is the will of man! Will can be trained and developed to draw con-\ntinuous supplies of life energy-into the body to renew it indefinitely.\n\nHEALING THROUGH Affirmations remind the soul of what it already\nSPIRITUAL AFFIRMATIONS 1128, and what it has temporarily lost because\n\nof forgetfulness. Affirmations are statements\nof Truth, and are different from begging prayers. Beggars seldom get what\nthey want from the Father, but a reformed son, trying to remember that he is\na 807 of God, 11 can, by means of affirmations, have anything through the prop-\ner application of the vibratory law. First, affirm for wisdom and bliss, then\nfor harmony, then for health, then for true happiness and success for all man-\nkind.\n\nWhen affirming for any desired end, you must free yourself again and\nagain of all devastating negative thoughts. Thought is the force that runs the\ncomplicated cellular machinery of the body as well as the machinery of human\ndestiny and of the entire cosmos. Thoughts carry on all the chemical, psycho-\nlogical, and metabolic functions of the body, just as the thoughts of the gener-\nal public, and of the politicians especially, shape the destiny of the national\nmachinery.\n\nThe perfect thoughts of God keep the cosmos in balance and rhythm. The\nright thoughts of man expressed in rightly uttered words also set up rhythmic\netheric vibrations that initiate proper actions on his part and harmonize all\ncircumstances connected with attainment of the desired result. When you utter\n\"God'' again and again, forgetting time and with ever increasing devotion, until\nyour consciousness forgets itself in affirming, at that point you will feel the\npresence of. God.\n\nWords are vibrations of thought. Thoughts are vibrations of power and\nenergy. Even strong words or commands, such as ''Wake up, '' are meaning -\nless if spoken feebly and without a background of latent, vigorous mental\nforce.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS FOR If you have a tendency to become angry at slight\n\nSPECIAL CURES provocation, find the affirmation which has the most\nmeaning for you and repeat it to yourself until your\n\nsubconscious mind is clear of all tendency to anger and harsh speech.

Criticize and reform yourself; that is where your great-\nest problem lies. Affirm divine calmness and peace, and send out only thoughts\nof love and goodwill if you want to live in peace and harmony. Never get angry,\nfor anger poisons your system. Try to understand people who cross you, and\nwhenever anybody tries to inflame you, mentally say: ''Ilam too comfortable\n\nto be angry. Idon't want to be sick with anger.'' If you are upset, and affirm\nwith anger in your heart: \"Iam peace, 1 am peace,'' your parroting cries\n\nwill mean nothing; instead of cultivating peace you will develop more anger.\n\nIf you affirm: ''Iam rich, 1 with a belief that you will never be rich, you\nwill remain poor, for your negative thoughts will keep your will paralyzed,\nmaking it impotent, unable to initiate the right modus operandi that would\nyield you the desired result. If you mechanically affirm, thinking, ''What is\nthe use of prosperity affirmations anyway?'' then of course no positive results\nwill be forthcoming.\n\n[3 individual practice of affirmations it is better to start in a whisper,\nor to utter them only mentally, but with deep, ever increasing mental power\nand conviction. Group affirmations may be started loudly or softly, but at the\nend should be chanted mentally only for some time, until the words change into\nvibratory messengers of thought sent forth in the ether to execute their errands\non your behalf. In group affirmations it is best for one person to take a single\nsentence, repeat it and if necessary explain its meaning, cautioning the group\n\nabout the inefficacy of mechanically uttering words without one-pointed atten-\n\ntion to their corresponding meaning.\n\nWhether they realize it or not, the members of a church choir generally\nsing with their concentration mostly on the music and on the pleasure of capti-\nvating their listeners. They are not really thinking deeply of God, to whom the\nsong or anthem is addressed. Hence in group singing the leader should see to\nit that the gathering does not mechanically grind out a song louder and louder,\nunthinkingly simulating emotion with volume. The words in a song to God\nshould never be sung without devotion. Rather, the devotional thought ina\nsong must be predominant in the singer's consciousness while the sound of the\nwords meekly, gently, softly follows his increasingly warm thought of love for\nthe Lord.\n\nTo practice an affirmation, first sit calmly with spine held straight. Stop\nthe conscious mind from being restless. Quiet the fanciful subconscious mind.\nInvoke the all-powerful superconsciousness by meditating deeply. Then make\nyour affirmation firmly and aloud, or in whispers, or mentally. All affirma-\ntions, whether repeated aloud or in whispers or mentally, must be impregnated\nwith ever increasing devotion and concentration. To be thinking of going toa\nmovie while you are again and again uttering ''God,'' is to take the name of the\nLord in vain. To say ''God\" once, with devotion, and increase the devotion\nwith each repetition of His name, is to dive deeper and deeper in the ocean of\nmind power until you reach a plumbless depth of God perception.\n\n"}

Of the different kinds of healing--by medicine,\ninjection, massage, nerve or vertebrae adjustment; by affirmation, imagina-\ntion, will, or faith--vibratory healing is of the greatest importance. Vibra-\ntory healing consists in creating and sending vibrations of life energy to dis-\neased individuals. This may be done internally by mentally projecting energy\ncharged with will power, or externally by the vibrations of chants, intonations\nof the human voice, and enlivening words, phrases, and affirmations impreg-\nnated with superconsciousness,\n\nIn connection with singing, chanting, or intoning away physical disease\nor worry or spiritual ignorance, one must know the law of intonation from\nhigh to low, to whisper, to mental, to subconscious, to superconscious chant-\ning. This is the method of converting loud words full of meaning, into real-\nized experiences, of assimilating the truth of a word or words by chanting\n\n"}

Better\nstill is to induce the peaceful superconscious state first, and from that state\nchant mentally or in a whisper, or aloud, as one pleases. Mental chanting is\nbest for individuals. Audible chanting, ranging from low to high, or vice\nversa, is good in congregations\n\nNoise affects the human nervous system, weakening this medium through\nwhich vital energy is supplied to all the principal organs of the body, the cir-\nculatory system, brain, and so forth. With the deterioration of the nervous\nsystem, the energy and thermal supply of the blood becomes low, leaving the\nbodily home open to disease bacteria. On the other hand, harmonious, soul-\ninspiring and soul-solacing sounds, chants impregnated with superconscious\nsoul force, will power, and faith, awaken the drooping tissues of the nervous\nsystem by rousing vital energy in them. Hence the external method of vibrat-\ning the voice according to the aforesaid methods can heal all inharmonious\nconditions of body, mind, and soul. A sincere kind word, an inspired song,\na soul-solacing voice of wisdom, have dispelled many sorrows and illumined\nreceptive persons with the light of lasting joy. ।\n\nThe law of repetition should be understood in order to derive the most |\nbenefit from chanting. Some Westerners fail to grasp the changing depths of\nconviction in Hindu chanting and hear in it only a monotonous repetition of\nwords. Of course, repetition of words without understanding their meaning\nand without deepening feeling and realization is useless. It is all right to re-\npeat just one phrase, 8प्८}) 28: ` 110 Father, heal me,\" or \"I am well, for\nThou art in 71611 extemporaneously--as it comes. Repeat it vigorously from\nlow voice to loud, from loud’ to whisper, and lastly from a whisper to mental\naffirmations, until one feels that he is repeating the phrase with varying depth\nof soul feeling--that is, until one finally realizes the meaning of his utterance\nin every fiber of his being. This is at-one-ment with one's own affirmations\nthrough audible and mental chanting. The moment the phrase reaches the\nsuperconsciousness and the inner intuitive conviction of the soul, a volley of\nenergy will shoot down through the spine and into the body; the vibration of\nthat current will heal body, mind, and soul, electrocuting physical disease\ngerms, paralyzing mental fears, and conflagrating soul ignorance into ashes.\n\nIn the Hindu tantra (Hymnal) scriptures we find the advice that all mystic |\nincantations and seed words have to be reévivified in the soul of the chanter,\nvitalized and precisely intoned or chanted in order to produce the desired +€ ~ `\nsults. Mere repetition of mantras or incantations without deep feeling does\nnot produce results.

Sometimes a person says only\na word, and the sick one is healed. In that case the receptivity of the patient\nand the power of the healer were perfectly balanced, which is necessary for\nsuccess in healing. Although healing power, which is the power of God, may\nbe within you, without the response of the patient it cannot function. A God-\nrealized master can produce healing in an unresponsive person, but it is much\nmore difficult; and only a master would be aware of the karmic circumstances\nthat would make such a healing possible.\n\nMind is the master-creator of the body, but a rebellious body will not obey\nthe mind. When a person has already enslaved his mind to physical processes,\nthat enslaved mind cannot heal; it must be made cognizant once more of its own\npower by one who is not enslaved. When you plow the mind of such a person\nwith your conviction and Self-realization, you make that person ready. Then\nintroduce your healing power.\n\nUPON WHAT DOES The power of healing depends upon the awakening\n\nTHE POWER OF of life force. In mental suggestion, the will of the\n\nHEALING DEPEND? healer is forced upon the imagination of the patient\nwhich arouses the sick person from his mental stupor,\n\nand excites his life force; that aroused life force produces healing. Different\n\nmental healing processes arouse different degrees of life force in the body.\n\n_Mental power that can awaken the life force instantaneously will produce in-\n\nstantaneous healing; but usually it takes a long time to disabuse a patient's\nmind of a wrong mental habit born of a chronic consciousness of disease.\nWhen it is finally erased from the mind, then healing does come instantane-\nously. But until the chronic thought of disease is vanquished, mental healing\ncannot be instantaneous.\n\nIf you want to heal others, you must first conquer your own physical body.\nIf you can still be overpowered by the trials and tribulations of bodily illness\nor injury, you have yet to learn to mentally rise above them while trying at\nthe same time to heal yourself. It is necessary to have a very strong mind,\nimpervious to the trials of unpleasant or painful sensations and muscular or\nnervous debilities. Your consciousness must be. impregnated with the truth\nthat you are living by Spirit, but happen to be occupying a body. Feel that\nyou are just favoring the body by staying there. You are Infinite Spirit. You\ncannot be caught in the cage of the body and never will be. Your knowledge is\nomnipresent; you are part of paradise. Your wings of eternity are spread\nover all space. You are only dreaming that you are caged ina body. You\nwere never really in the cage--you are not in it now nor will you ever be.\nHow did you happen to think that you are this little body? When the soul identi-\nfies itself with a physical body, it becomes subjected to processes of delusion.\nBut when you close your eyes you no longer see the little body; you are Infinite.\nNothing is so important to you as to know this truth.\n\nae अप a\n\n"}

Are you going to spend your entire\nlife merely studying methods of diet, making obeisance at the feet of medi-\ncine? Or are you going to be one with your Maker and say: ''I am above all\ndisease--physical, mental, and spiritual--for Iam a child of God!\"\n\nYou are living by the power of God.

A person who wishes\nIN HEALING to exert healing power to help another person must\n\nrecognize the particular nature of that person before\nemploying, for the purpose of healing, autosuggestion, imagination, or will\npower. If the sick person is the will type, use will power to heal. If he is\nthe imaginative type, use imagination to heal. If you use imagination to help\na reasoning type, he will laugh at you; it is necessary to reason with such a\nperson. Use reason, autosuggestion, or will power, whichever is suitable,\nuntil you can convince the sick person of his own mental healing power, or of\nthe healing power flowing through you. You must have in your mind a picture\nof the complete healing of that person, and impress him with it.\n\nA healer who strongly introduces his mental suggestion or will power will\nsoon see in the patient a quickening response, and that idea of healing will\ngrow to harvest. He will also find, after he has several times given healing\nsuggestions to a person who is responsive to these forces, that the person be-\ning treated will begin to realize that healing actually comes from within. The\npatient sees that the mind of someone else can heal his body, and begins to\nrealize the truth: \"If someone else's mind can heal me, then I can heal my-\nself.'' Such a one is on the way to regaining self-mastery over the body.\n\nEverything we do is guided by our will. Every time you move a muscle,\nyou are using will. If you did not use your will, you would cease to think or\nlive. God's will is not autocratic; it is guided by wisdom. If you tune in your\nwill with God's will, His wisdom will guide your will. Human will, when\nguided by infinite wisdom, becomes one with God's will.\n\nYou must feel a strong will to heal the patient. Your will, feeling, and\ninterest must be aroused to the same degree they would be if the dearest one\nyou love were dying. Feel that same degree of interest in someone else. A\nmother's desire to heal her sick child is usually strong, but if she meets some\nadverse condition in healing she is likely, because of her anxiety, to give up\nand let doubt creep in. The spiritual man has the same will to heal as a moth-\ner, but he is never discouraged by adverse conditions arising in the patient.\n\nOne who is seeking to give healing aid to others should always remember\n\n"}

The healer should\nsteadily will that healing shall come, no matter what may be the condition of\nthe person, nor how many doctors and other healers have given him up. Even\nif such a patient fails to respond to any kind of treatment and dies, one should\nsay, ''My will was not strong enough.'' When you have indomitable will, you\n\ncan heal.\n\nSPIRITUAL SENSITIVITY Spiritual sensitivity is the consciousness of\nomniscience, which everyone should try to\ndevelop. As your spiritual sensitivity increases your consciousness projects\ninto space, into the hearts of other human beings. First try to have more\nfeeling for human beings, then for plants and all of God's animal creatures.\nIt is easy to love trees and plants because they do not talk back, but it is hard\nto love human beings, who often misunderstand even the best things we do. It\nis always good to project that spiritual sensitivity in order to feel for others\nas you do for yourself. Do not let it hurt you, however. A person who wishes\n= offer healing help to others must be able to feel and understand others' view-\npoints and needs, but he should also be able to project his spiritual response\nwithout being emotionally affected. If the spiritually sensitive man puts on\nthe conditions of others, he needs healing himself and should not be trying to\nheal others.\n\nNevertheless, spiritual sensitivity is essential in healing. Those who are\nspiritually advanced can throw the searchlight of their sensitivity on others,\ndiagnose their troubles, then prescribe a remedy. Lahiri Mahasaya helped\nmany persons in this way. . That diagnosis which comes through spiritual\nawareness is much more wonderful and accurate than any scientific determin-\nation by physicians who can only judge from certain outwardly discernible con-\nditions of the body, and who therefore may sometimes be led to draw wrong\nconclusions. Those who are spiritually in tune with the sick person can intu-\nitively feel where the trouble lies. One who wishes to diagnose others’ ail-\nments must have keen spiritual sensitivity. Otherwise he will be making pro-\nnouncements about the patient's condition without really knowing the nature of\nthe trouble.\n\nHe must also understand which cases he can help quickly, and which ones\nhe cannot help. It is necessary to find out what specific disease that person\nhas. Suppose he complains of headache, spinal pains, an ache in some other\npart of the body--these can usually be healed very easily; but one must first\nmake sure whether the pain is caused by nerves or some organic trouble. In\ncases of organic trouble it sometimes happens that the healer is able to take\nthe patient's pain away by suggestion, while the disease is actually spreading.\nTo try to heal others is to undertake a great responsibility, and if one fails,\neither through lack of power or lack of responsiveness from the patient, then\nit is better to send him or her to someone else for healing. Do not suggest\nwhere he shall go; but it is permissible to say: ''I believe in this or that form\nof therapy. \"'\n\n"}

If the stimulation of life energy\nTO HEALTH alone is responsible for man's life and well-being, why is\n\nfood so important? The answer is that all cells, including\nthose of the food we eat, have latent intelligence, and can influence our minds\nand brain cells. For persons who can assimilate them without difficulty, nat-\nural foods such as raw fruit, vegetables, and nuts have a harmonious and\nstrengthening effect on the mind, and permit the life energy to flow unimpeded\nthrough the body. Foods such as meat, which retain the vibrations of pain,\nfear, and anger of the dying animal, and denatured foods, which have had\ntheir natural properties destroyed through improper methods of cooking, are\nirritating and disturbing to the equilibrium of the mind and rob it of its birth-\nright: the power to awaken and direct the life energy to heal any part of the\nbody. Whereas food itself cannot heal, natural foods indirectly produce\nhealth by keeping the mind calm, thus permitting the normal flow of life ener-\ngy to proceed unobstructed. Unnatural, improperly prepared, and gross\nfoods have the opposite effect.\n\nThe first persons who felt dis-ease or discomfort in the body probably\ndesisted at once from eating, as we find the animals doing. Therefore, the\nfirst method of healing was fasting, or giving rest to the human machinery.\nOriginally, sick persons must have been instinctively led to eliminate certain\nhard-to-digest foods from their diet and to seek easy-to-digest foods such as\ncertain roots and herbs. This led to the discovery of the specific uses of the\ndifferent herbs as medicine. The Chinese and the Hindus have specialized in\nthe knowledge of this second method of healing. Later on, owing to migration,\nchange of climate, and difficulty in finding the required herbs on demand, man\ndiscovered he could make concentrated extracts and medicine from herbs.\nThus the third method was to induce chemical changes in the blood through\nherbal medicines.\n\nTHOUGHTS TO LIVE BY\n\nDisease is due to the shutting out of life force, the healing rays of God.\nNo matter what you are suffering from, you must remember that you should\nassist God in helping you. His willingness to help you is not lacking; it is\nyour wrong behavior that prevents you from receiving help. First of all, you\nshould try to make amends for any wrong you have done that has shut out God's\n\nhealing powers.\n\nKK\n\nHOW A SAINT CONVERTED A THIEF --Part 1\n\nA pious saint, Tulsidas, used to worship an image of Rama, the epic\nprophet of India. Some princely devotees of Tulsidas, themselves enraptured\nby his intense devotion to Rama, gave him many gold utensils to be used in\n\n"}

Saint Tulsidas always left the tem-\n\n@ ple open, even at night, when it was his custom to meditate under a bower of\nfragrant flowers about a hundred yards away from the building. Even while\nhe meditated deeply on Rama, Tulsidas felt intuitive premonitions that his\ngold utensils would be stolen.\n\nHis fear was not unfounded. A thief who had learned about the gold uten-\nsils in Tulsidas' unlocked temple had been secretly watching every night for\nan opportunity to stealthem. Yet on seven successive nights when he ap-\nproached the temple he beheld a living image of the prophet Rama, armed\nwith bow and arrows, guarding the entrance. This puzzled the thief, for dur-\ning the day he had noted that there was no sentry at the door, and he knew that\nit could not be Tulsidas dressed as Rama, because each night he had taken\nthe precaution to make sure, before trying to enter the temple, that Tulsidas\nwas steeped in deep meditation under his favorite flowery bower.\n\nThe bewildered thief tried a new tactic. Dressing one morning as a gen-\ntleman, he went to Tulsidas and said: \"Honored Sir, I have heard that you do\nnot lock the temple door, even at night, so that true devotees may ever avail\nthemselves of the opportunity to enter and meditate. For seven nights I have\ndeeply desired to enter your temple to meditate and receive the holy vibrations\nthere, yet I have not dared to enter because I beheld your hired sentry, dressed\nas the prophet Rama and holding a bow and arrows, menacingly guarding the\n\n@ temple door. am disappointed not-to-be able to-get-im.\"\\—— 1 1\n\nTears came to Tulsidas' eyes, and he asked the ''gentleman\": \"18 it true\nthat you saw Rama guarding the temple door? Iam sorry. I will ask my sen-\ntry not to guard the temple door again, so that you may enjoy your visit at any\ntime. ''\n\nSaint Tulsidas understood intuitively that his fear of the loss of the tem-\nple's gold utensils had caused the prophet Rama to take the trouble to materi-\nalize himself and guard the temple treasures. Tulsidas also knew, although\nhe told no one, that the man in gentlemanly garb was a thief.\n\n(To be continued)\n(1.\nAFFIRMATION\nHeavenly Father, Thou art present in every atom, every\n\ncell, every corpuscle, in every particle of nerve, brain, and\ntissue.

I am ashamed to\nhave bothered you with my fears. '' Rama appeared in a vision and acceded to\nthe prayer.\n\nBelieving in Tulsidas's assurance of an unguarded temple, and making sure\nthat Tulsidas was deeply meditating that night under his favorite tree, the thief\nstalked across the garden toward the temple to steal the golden utensils. There\nwas no god guarding the temple door in the deep stillness of the night. On tiptoe,\nthe thief softly went to the door and gently pushed it wide open so that he could\npass through. He beheld no one inthe temple, so he hurriedly gathered together\nmost of the golden utensils, put them in a gunny sack and briskly walked out.\n\nOn the way out he met a stray dog who began to bark at him and chase him. The\nthief, with the gold utensils clinking on his back, increased his pace to a run and\nraced for safety.\n\nTulsidas had finished his meditation and was resting under the tree, expect-\ning the return of the thief, when he heard the bark of a dog, the padding of racing\nfeet, and a tinkling sound. Rising, he went into the temple and discovered the\nloss of almost all of the gold utensils.\n\nThe saint gathered together the remaining few gold pieces hurriedly, tied\nthem in a napkin, and sped in the direction from which he heard the barking of\nthe dog. Being a healthy devotee, Tulsidas ran like a stag and quickly overtook\nthe thief. The latter, now filled with fear and remorse, fell at the feet of Tul-\nsidas and cried: ''Gracious Saint, please take back your gold utensils. Idon't\nwant them. I beg of you not to turn me over to the police, for Ihave a family to\nsupport. \"'\n\nSaint Tulsidas laughed merrily and, patting the thief on the back, handed\nhim the rest of the gold utensils, saying: ''Son, I did not overtake you to arrest\nyou, but to give you the rest of the utensils, which you had missed, being in such\na hurry.

Only that which does not change--i.e., the soul--can cognize with\nproper perspective the changing phenomena of the mind, the body, and the\nworld about us.\n\nThe ocean changes its aspect constantly, but in essence it remains the\n88176; 80 also the Spirit spins forth this dream of cosmos in which It.swims in\nthe ocean of change, yet remains essentially the same unaffected Spirit. A man\npassing through childhood, adolescence, youth, and old age finds his thoughts\ngenerally and correspondingly changing; he too is swimming in God's sea of\nchange. And like Spirit, man's soul never changes, even though, as it swims\nabout in the ocean of change, it undergoes outwardly the physical and mental\ntransitions from youth to adulthood to old age. The soul remains without change\nor motion, just as a man watching the dancing, changing waves of the ocean re-\nmains himself unchanged. The spiritually unenlightened man may not be con-\nscious of his soul, but he is aware of its reflection-~-the ego. And even the ego\nis relatively permanent. That is, man's ego continues to exist from life to life,\neven though it does not retain the memory of what happens when the bodily ma-\n१. 3 disintegrates with the change called death.\n\nMan is not like an automobile engine, whose life ends with the disintegra-\ntion of its component parts; man is the maker of his own mental and physical\nmachinery. The destruction of the machine does not mean the destruction of\nthe maker of the machine. A central ego exists in man during the period of his\nexistence in the mother's body, even though the memory of that prenatal state\ndoes not remain in his consciousness after physical birth. Remembrance is\nnot the proof of existence. A madman, or a forgetful man, or a sleeping man,\nor a man under hypnosis or anesthetic exists without knowing it. The relatively\nunchangeable ego of man, which outlasts all mental changes of childhood, ado-\nlescence, youth, and the aged state, existed in prenatal periods and survives\nin postnatal periods. The mind watches the bodily changes and the ego watches\n\n"}

Behind them both is the unchangeable soul, which observes all.\nmental changes, itself remaining unchanged. In the eternal consciousness of\nthe immortal soul is the germ of man's desire for eternal youth. It is because\nhe attributes to youth the qualities that are really found only inthe soul---\neternal consciousness, eternal existence, eternal joy--that man seeks eternal\n\"youth. +\n\nThroughout the span of conscious existence,-from the birth of the ego or\n\"T-ness, '' man finds that there is something which’is stable, as compared ‘to\nall the furious changes that go on in his environment. ‘Hence it is reasonable\nto expect that if the ego could at all times detach itself from its mental and\nphysical environment of alternating happiness and sorrow, health and disease,\ngood fortune and-ill fortune, its consciousnéss would be stable, unchanged by\nenvironmental influences. The real \"youth'' man is seeking is this unchange- ।\nable consciousness of immortality and invulnerability against the buffeting\nwaves of the phenomenal sea of change\n\nThe teaching of Yoga is designed to blow'up the bridge of feeling that con-:\nnects our various experiences with the ego. It is feeling that causes us to re-\ngard happiness or pain as affecting us; it is feeling that creates mental attach-\nment to certain things or people, causing us pain when we are separated from\nthem. The destruction of this bridge of feeling does not mean that we attain a\nstate of heartlessness, apathy, want of ambition, or indifference, as if we\nwere merely moving fossils. It means that we take joy or sorrow calmly and\nexperience everything willingly, without being inwardly affected by the paltry\ndesires, likes or dislikes, and:whims of the ego. To be able cheerfully to\nexperience health or disease (while sensibly seeking a remedy), sudden in-\ntensive pleasure or pain, is the way to attain mental stability. This ‘stability :\nis the real fountain of lasting mental youthfulness. “^ “`\n\nThe man who establishes himself in'the everlasting consciousness of the\nsoul may retain physical youth if he so desires.

If any further fortune were\nfound, half of it was to be given to the queen and half to the people of the king-\ndom. The will stated that, in all, a sum of twelve million dollars in gold\ncoin was hidden in the royal gardens.\n\nOf the ten brothers, the eldest was saintly and the eighth and ninth broth-\ners were very wicked.

As he was digging, under the surveillance of the other nine\nbrothers, he suddenly struck a box of gold containing one million dollars.\n\nHe promised that later, ona little mound in the garden, he would distrib-\nute the money equally among them. The brothers did not know that previous-\nly he had secretly hired men to dig a ten-foot-wide and twenty-foot-deep moat\naround the mound, which he then had covered with thin sticks and loose earth,\nwith a little concealed bridge of solid planks leading to the middle of the mound.\n\nHe asked his brothers to stand in a certain spot near the brink of the moat\nwhile he went to the mound via the secret bridge.

Some persons have\nlearned how to relax physically, but not mentally. And even mental relaxation\nis only one of the first states of metaphysical or super relaxation, in which there\nis complete, voluntary withdrawal of consciousness and energy from the entire\nbody, and full absorption in one's true identity: Spirit. This release of conscious-\nness from the delusion of duality affords the highest kind of mental relaxation.\nBefore the mind can be free of all distractions--those induced by sensory impres-\nsions from witha and within, and those created by restlessly wandering thoughts\n--some degree of physical relaxation is necessary. Those who are very strong-\nminded may be able to overcome physical distractions by the command of mind\nalone; but usually the beginner yogi finds that it is easier first to overcome physi-\ncal restlessness by some physical method.\n\nMETHOD OF RELAXING A When you want to relax any one of the twenty body\nPARTICULAR BODY PART parts (as categorized in the lessons on the Recharg-\n\ning Exercises), gently tense that part low, mediun,\nand high, and relax; then keep it still. This is the scientific way to remove any\npossible tension in a particular body part and to relax it completely.\n\nBEST WAY TO RELAX For complete relaxation of the whole body, first\nENTIRE BODY QUICKLY tense the entire body and then \"let go.\" It is\n\npossible to withdraw the energy from muscles and\nlimbs in this way, so that your body will feel like a mass of lifeless flesh and\nbones--like a helpless jellyfish. Remember that if you are holding one arm even\nslightly apart from the body, you are tensed--you are burning energy in that part\nand hence you are not completely relaxed.\n\n"}

You can relax the whole body\nthis way while standing, sitting, or lying down. Repeat twice, to insure relax-\nation by removing all tension from all body parts.\n\nThis is conscious muscular or motor relaxation. The purpose of this method\nof relaxation is to withdraw consciousness and energy from the muscles at will.\nThe complete absence of motion and tension from the muscles and limbs is\n''relaxation. '' If the body seems jellylike, as if without bones or muscles, you\nhave attained perfect muscular relaxation.\n\nThere is also unconscious muscular relaxation, an imperfect method that\nconsists in moving the limbs about vigorously and then being quiet. Those who\ntry this generally do not succeed in keeping more than half the muscles relaxed.\nSome people remain completely tensed, only imagining that they are relaxed.\n\nPassive Sensory Relaxation or Sleep Sensory Relaxation or Slee In muscular relaxation as described\n\nabove, the mind and energy are relaxed\nor withdrawn from the muscles but not from the sensory nerves or from the\nsense seats in the mind that receive perceptions via the optic, auditory, olfac-\ntory, tactile, and gustatory nerves.\n\n| । ` ~ When thé soul becomés satiated with the material experiences of the day, it\npassively switches off the life force and mind from the senses to create the state\nof sleep. During deep sleep, the mind and energy are passively and unconscious-\nly withdrawn from both the motor and sensory nerves, and even thoughts are\nbanished.\n\nSleep can be induced at will also. Lie down on the back, quickly relaxing\nthe whole body, closing the eyes and quieting the thought processes. Try this\nuntil you learn to sleep at will.\n\nDreams can be induced in the following manner: With closed eyes, visualize\na different room from the one in which you are resting, and fall asleep thinking\nof it.\n\nSUPER SILENCE METHODS That which can be done passively and un-\nconsciously--i.e., the practice of silence\n\nby going to sleep at will--can also be attained consciously. Through long and\n\ndevotional practice of the SRF techniques of meditation, one can achieve complete\n\ncalmness in the heart, lungs, and other organs. When the muscles and inner\n\norgans are freed from constant motion by relaxation, the breaking down of bodily\n\ntissues and the accumulation of wastes is temporarily inhibited. This helps to\n\nkeep the bloodstream pure, and hence is important to higher states of mental\n\n@ि and metaphysical relaxation.\n"}

When this process can be stopped, even momentarily, an exceptional\ndegree of physical rest is attained.\n\nFirst of all, with the cessation of ordinary cellular activities of growth,\nassimilation, and elimination, there is no need for food and oxygen, which are\nbrought to the cells by the bloodstream or for carrying off impurities of waste\nmaterials, which are borne away by the bloodstream also. The heart is thus\nrelieved of its immense burden of pumping blood. (From the standpoint of actual\nweight moved, the heart pumps twelve tons of blood in a day. )\n\nThe cells and tissues then live directly by subtle life energy. Bloodborne\nfood and oxygen being no longer required by the cells, there is a temporary\ncessation of activity on the part of the heart and also on the part of the lungs,\nwhich releases to the rest of the body an enormous quantity of life current ordi-\nnarily used by these two great engines.

Those who can enter a high state of mental relaxation,\nat will, find that physical relaxation comes automatically.

With deep calmness you can arrest the\nactivities of the entire physical machinery, consciously and voluntarily.\n\nEvery morning, after practicing physical relaxation, enter into absolute\nsilence, and banish thoughts for several minutes each time. (There is an impor-\ntant difference between banishing thoughts from the mind--a conscious act of\ncontrol of the thought processes--and in relinquishing control of the thoughts in\norder to enter a passive, unconscious state of mental blankness.

Hence this life force is an intelligent magnet-\nic energy imbued with instinctive powers for creating different bodily designs\nout of different kinds of protoplasm, and for creating the different mental\npatterns of living beings.\n\nThe intelligent life force works through the sexual creative impulse in\nanimals and human beings to express itself, giving birth to desire-inflicted,\ntendency-guided animal and human beings in animal and human bodies. Every\nhuman being should be thoroughly cognizant of the earth-binding nature of the\nimpulses of the sex creative force.

It is\ntherefore extremely necessary to transmute this physical-creation-desirous\nimpulse into a spiritually productive impulse.

The sex instinct of parents becomes depraved owing to ungoverned\nprenatal tendencies and ungoverned sex impulses of this life. These uncon-\ntrolled impulses are born in children who also had ungoverned sex appetites\nin their last incarnations. Such children attract specific parents who, like\nthem, have undisciplined sex appetites.\n\nह | ~~~ “Social persecution and admonitions cannot correct evil habits of sex in\nchildren, youths, and adults; only the knowledge of how to destroy the deep-\nseated prenatal and postnatal causes that make sex impulses ungovernable\ncan correct them. It is a shame that people unable to control sex impulses\nare not psychophysiologically and spiritually treated instead of being gossip-\nlashed and socially persecuted.\n\nGossipmongers who talk about the moral weaknesses of others usually are\nthemselves not free from sex weakness; they have to persecute others just to\nfeed their own secret sex weakness indirectly, thereby mentally bringing\nothers to their own low moral levels. Such people think that they themselves\nare all right because their weakness is not discovered.\n\nCharacter detectives deliberately searching for moral weakness in others,\nand gossipmongers who enjoy advertising the moral weaknesses of others, are\nnot true reformers capable of giving real spiritual uplift. A spiritual uplifter\nnever talks about another's moral weakness; he never rejoices at his short-\ncomings. Instead, he pictures himself in the other person's position and feels\nsorry for him and tries to lift him up, if that help is wanted. When he sees\nsomebody morally sick, he says: ''But for the grace of God, there goes my-\n\nself.\"\n\n© The man who has attained to the all-encompassing cosmic consciousness\nof the soul is not satisfied merely to spiritually transmute his own physical\n\n"}

When one is illumined, he sees himself as the one Spirit throbbing with-\n\nin all minds and bodies. Sucha person, after liberating his own body, tries\n\nto liberate spiritually all other bodies belonging to his own Self; that is, Spirit.\n\nHOW TO TRANSMUTE The best way to transmute sex impulses is to inhale\nTHE SEX IMPULSE and exhale deeply during sex excitement until the\n\n-sex energy is transmuted into oxygen in the lungs.\nWhile transmuting this sex consciousness, and during inhalation and exhala-\ntion, the mind should be kept busy affirming: 'I want to transmute sex ener-\ngy into spiritual energy. I want to turn it Godward to create spiritually. ''\n\nImmediately after the sex impulse has been dissipated by inhalation and\nexhalation, read some holy scripture or begin to meditate on the joy of the\nSpirit within. Whenever the sex impulse revisits you, continuously inhale and\nexhale deeply. By inhalation and exhalation, tremendous energy is concentra-~-\nted in the heart and lungs. Then the heart and lungs become magnets of living\ncurrents pulling energy away from all other parts of the body, especially the\nsex region. Then when the mind becomes engrossed in the deep God-peace of\nmeditation, or busy with deep spiritual thoughts, the brain becomes a spiritu-\nal magnet pulling all the transmuted energy accumulated in the heart and lungs\ninto the cerebral spiritual reservoir.\n\nThe more one indulges in sex life, the more the intelligence and life force\ngo downward into the sex nerves and compel the deluded soul to live more and\nmore on the sex plane. Now the spiritual law is that the more you try--by the\nforegoing yogic method--to send the life current back into the heart and unite\nthe heart current with the brain current, the more you will overcome the sex\ntemptation and be able to redirect sex impulses to create beautiful spiritual\nchildren of joy, peace, and happiness in the soul.\n\nLast of all, by deeper meditation you will be able to connect the conscious-\nness and energy that have been withdrawn from the sex region into the brain\nwith Cosmic Consciousness and Cosmic Energy. When Cosmic Consciousness\nand Cosmic Energy become trapped in the body by the snare of physically\ncreative tendencies, these tendencies strive to keep the soul tied to a series\nof incarnated bodies, busily creating vehicles for earthbound souls. But when\nthe soul's attention is directed more and more toward Spirit, by disengaging\nits attention from the powerful creative sex impulses, it eventually becomes\nliberated from creating earthbound beings and hence from remaining on the\nplane of reincarnations.\n\nIf you deeply and regularly practice the foregoing method, striving con-\ntinuously and consciously to live on the spiritual plane--not by imagination |\nbut by actually transmuting sex impulses into creative activity on the heart,\nbrain, and spirit plane--you will attract a true life companion who can help\n\n"}

Ever Since,\nphysical creation has taken the place of creating by will power. An original\nerror in creating by flesh has thus become the present law of creation. Be-\ncause of this, imperfect and sometimes undesirable children may be imposed\nupon man by the protoplasmic law of heredity.\n\nIn mental or immaculate conception children could be created \"'to order\"\neven as God originally created perfect beings endowed with free choice. Adam\nand Eve, being divine children, inherited from the Father this free choice;\nbut they misused that freedom and wandered away from God's perfect laws.\nEveryone who finds his self-control waning should remember that yielding\nwill hasten his flight toward the pitfalls of disease, premature old age, men-\n\n~ tal dissatisfaction, loss of ambition, boredom, unhappiness, and premature ~~”\n\nunhappy death.\n\n1.\nTHE LOVE OF GOD AND NATIONS--Part 3\n\nThe ninth brother jeeringly replied: \"It doesn't matter what you say.

A shot rang\nthrough the silence. The eldest prince was now bleeding from a wound and\nyet he advanced, saying: ''Brother, you may give me death, but I will give\nyou love instead. Kill me first. Shoot again and find out how wrong you are.\n\n11\n\nFor my life, spare the others.\n\nAt this, the ninth brother threw his gun and dagger away and fell at the\nfeet of the eldest prince.

By steady rains of diligence in self-discipline may I remove:\nfrom my cities of spiritual carelessness the ancient debris of delu-\nsion. Let the deluge wash away the disfiguring slums of narrow- `\nmindedness and race-and-creed prejudice. O Lord, may the soiled,\nuntidy thought-children of my realm bathe in Thy waters of purity and\n\norderliness.\nKKK\n\nANALYSIS OF THE MIND--Part 1\n\nDogmatism limits man's mind if a little knowledge prevents him from see-\ning beyond the wall of his own ideas. Such a person may try to see other view-\npoints, but anything that is beyond his intellectual conception he is inclined to\ndoubt, or even to consider untrue. A man once came to me preaching the supe-\nriority of the mind, but when I analyzed him I found that his mind was concen-\ntrated on his body. The vulture soars high but its mind is on the creatures in\nthe canyon below. Similarly an intelligent person's mind may be roaming in\nthe realm of ideas and yet be centered on the body and the attachments to which\nthe body is subject. He whose concentration is on his person--on the exertions\nof the body, the muscular activity produced by the nervous system, is a material @\nbeing. Rising above body consciousness does not mean neglect of the body nor\nof one's work. One should care for the body and perform one's work with his\nmind on the divine purpose to be fulfilled by attending to these duties. He who\ncan keep his concentration centered on his inner Self even while he is busy with\nhis work is a spiritual being\n\nRealize that when you can reverse the searchlight of your concentration\nfrom the senses to the inner Self, you change from sense attachment to self-\ncontrol, from restlessness to calmness, from consciousness of the body to con-\nsciousness of soul peace; the searchlight of your attention is reversed--turned\ntoward Spirit. Ordinarily that searchlight in man is pouring its beam outward\nthrough the senses, illumining the world of matter. When man's attention is\nthus constantly engaged in the observation and enjoyment of the outer material\nworld, he naturally becomes materially attached. When he seeks to withdraw\nhis consciousness and life force from its preoccupation with the material world,\nhe should begin by concentrating on peace, the quality of the soul that is felt\nwhen there is an absence of any disturbance of thought waves in the ocean of\nmind stuff\n\nAVOID MENTAL AND Peace should not be mistaken, however, for mental\nPHYSICAL LAZINESS and physical laziness, which are extremely detri-\n\nmental to spiritual realization. Occasional physical @\nidleness may be necessary for relaxation from overwork but no one should allow\n\n"}

The lazy person's whole being becomes\n\"ossified'' when he delays his spiritual progress. Laziness in body or mind must\nbe driven away before the spiritual aspirant can emerge from the dark clouds of\nignorance into the bright kingdom of God. As soldiers who are getting ready for\nbattle are not allowed to indulge in idleness, so a spiritual warrior should not\ncountenance mental lethargy in himself, nor should he disregard his rightful\nmaterial duties. Most people are unsuccessful in life owing largely to mental\nand physical indolence. Physical idleness may be excused sometimes, but men-\ntal idleness should not be tolerated, because mental laziness is due to the ener-\nvation of thought that results when there is insufficient contact with the super-\nconscious mind. Never let yourself think that work is too much for you. Remem-\nber that God is creating universes and He is never tired. You are made in His\nimage, and if you want to be like Him you should emulate His tremendous capac-\nity for activity. Our capacity grows as we become more aware, through ever-\nincreasing contact with superconsciousness, of the unlimited nature of our being.\n\nWhatever duties you are performing, act always with the thought that you\nare doing God's work. Each day say to yourself, ''What can I do for God today?\"\nA spiritual leader has to have a vision of the future, but he should never be\nworried about it. God will take care of everything. Do your best today and for-\nget tomorrow. Do not harass the soul with petty worries. Every day create\nsomething in your mind. In that way you will reproduce your spiritual experi-\nences in your conscious life. You should have a constant flow of spiritual expe-\nriences, no matter what you are doing. Always be superconsciously active,\nengaged inwardly in divine communion. \"In waking, eating, working, dreaming,\nsleeping, serving, meditating, chanting, divinely loving, my soul constantly\nhums, unheard by any: 'God! God! God!' !!\n\nThe spiritual man does not even let himself go to sleep at night until he has\nmeditated. He says: \"I have something better than sleep. My body is too much\nused to the habit of sleep.'' Let your body sleep awhile each night, but be awake\nin God while you are asleep. When you can do that you will be in the supercon-\nscious. That is the deeper meaning of overcoming mental inactivity.\n\nHOW YOU CAN FULLY WITHDRAW By complete relaxation man can withdraw\n\nENERGY AND CONSCIOUSNESS his consciousness and life force at will\nFROM THE PHYSICAL BODY AND from the physical body. It is necessary\nCONCENTRATE IT IN THE SPINE to detach oneself from all motion,\n\nbecause motion brings about the death\nof spiritual consciousness. Spirit is that vast stillness which is behind all created\nthings. In creation, everything is in motion, in flux. You can sit still, but are\nyou relaxed? By the slightest movement that you make you send energy into the\nmuscles, and you are then not relaxed; you are using life force and energy in\nthose limbs and muscles.\n\nWhen trying various ways of relaxing by withdrawing energy from the mus-\ncles and directing the conscious mind away from the material world, it is\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 574, "text": "S-3 P-72 4\n\nnecessary to realize that mental effort alone is not enough to withdraw thought.\nYou cannot withdraw your thought successfully from any object unless you also\nwithdraw your energy. That is, wherever our muscles and bones are working,\nwherever we perform activities, there our minds are engrossed. That is why\nwe must not only withdraw our thoughts but also our energy from the body in\norder to concentrate fully on God. Motion sprang from God, but God is not\nmotion. ''Beyond the trackless track, beyond all motion's motion, there--in\nthe land of perennial peace--I am.'' Motion, plus Spirit, is projected in the\nether, but pure Spirit is entirely without motion. Only one part of space mani-\nfests motion; another part has none. We cannot say ''space and time\" in describ-\ning motionless Spirit, for that phrase is meaningful only to the material con-\nsciousness.\n\nSo, the first step toward withdrawing the consciousness and energy from the\nbody into the spine is to withdraw the consciousness from all the muscles. And\nthe best way to accomplish that is to relax the muscles: tense the whole body\nand let go quickly. If you do not practice this method of relaxation, there are\noften many little places in the body where waves of energy continue to dance.\nEven in the act of relaxation you move some parts of your body; and in moving\neven a finger you are being active--conscious energy is active in that part of\nyour body. Wherever you keep your mind and energy engaged, there your con-\nsciousness will be tied. Little knots of energy and consciousness in the muscles\nkeep the mind tied to those parts of the body. When the body is in motion, the\nconscious life energy is tied to the entire body. Relax: untie the knots. I\nbelieve it was Socrates who said that a human being is a knot of consciousness\nand matter. A tangle of knots, actually! The first knot to untie, in order to\nrelease the Spirit within, is the knot of muscular consciousness. It is necessary\nto remove all tension and send relaxation to the knots--big and small-- in the\nmuscles. When you move involuntarily without willing to move, you area\nslave to the muscles, you are bound with the knot of muscular consciousness.\n\nIt is vitally necessary to release one's consciousness from muscular\nmotion, because the soul as ego has become so used to the muscular activity\nof the physical vehicle that it thinks it is involved and identified with it. You\nwill see that when you are absolutely still, and relaxing your consciousness\nfrom the body, you can still feel the weight of your body within yourself. You\ncan feel that weight when you jump. What makes you feel weight? Conscious-\nness and energy. The yogi can feel the weight of his body even in a perfectly\nmotionless posture. Remember that muscular relaxation, though it is not easy,\nis extremely important for spiritual development. Muscular relaxation means\nwithdrawing energy and consciousness from the wave of muscular motions; it\nis not a simple thing.\n\nAlways meditate in a sitting posture; if you lie down, your body has a ten-\ndency to fallasleep. Habit centers your mind on the subconsciousness, and\nyou drowse and dream. But when you meditate in a sitting posture, it is\neasier to keep awake and ready; and when the divine energy comes--released\n\n"}

This\nrapacious robber lived by pillage, murder, and plunder. It is said that the\ntiger--even though it may be gorged to the throat with meat-- will go on killing\nanimals just for the thrill of killing. Similarly the tiger-bandit Rakusha\nexcelled in the art of cruelty. Flouting and ridiculing every spiritual law, he\nwas truly an incarnation of wickedness. The following incident is but a sample\nof his supreme perversity.\n\nRukusha had started with his band to plunder a poor little village at the out-\nskirts of a forest. As he passed through the woods he carried on an orgy of\nkilling songbirds just for the thrill of it. When he arrived at the end of the\nforest he perceived a mile-long dirt road leading into the village. This road\nwas lined by talltrees. One of the bandit gang remarked that the trees must\nafford travelers welcome shade from the sultry heat of the Oriental sun ''Well,'\"'\nsaid the bandit leader, ''all of you get busy and circle those trees, cutting their\nbark so that they will die. No longer shall they be liberal with their shade to\nthe villagers.'' His orders were obeyed\n\nAs the band of robbers were about to enter the village, they found that they\nhad to walk over some loose bricks laid down as steppingstones in a muddy\npuddle of water. After they had crossed the puddle, the bandit king thought:\n\"Let me remove the bricks, lest anyone else have the comfort of walking over\nthem and thus miss an unpleasant contact with the mud.'' However, on second\nthought he remembered that he himself would have to cross the puddle again,\non his way back to his den beyond the forest. He therefore refrained from\nremoving the bricks.\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 577, "text": "5-3 77-72 7\n\n© As the bandit and his followers were entering the village, several holy men\nhappened to be leaving it, and they were delighted to walk on the bricks in the\nmud puddle, thus avoiding soiling their sandals.\n\nThe bandits plundered the village, slaughtering men, women, and children,\nand started on the return journey to their cave. Again the bandit king had to\nwalk on the bricks over the mud puddle; but, after he and his ruffians were\nthrough using the bricks, the leader pushed them with his long spear into the\ndeepest holes of the mud puddle, lest any one else use them.\n\nShortly after this, Rakusha was treacherously killed by one of his subordi-\nnates, who wanted to rule the robber group. It is said in the Hindu scriptures\nthat every man has two angels, each with a recording book; one resides invisi-\nbly at his left shoulder and the other at his right. The angel on the left writes\nin his book all a man's misdeeds, and the angel on the right records all his\nvirtuous actions. When Rakusha's soul was being escorted to a particularly\ndark and hideous part of Hades, the leader in charge of Heaven and Hades, to\nmake sure that no injustice be done, asked the robber's two angels to look in\ntheir records and say what they found. The angel on the left said, ''Honored\nSir, the book of sin is so full of this man's wicked deeds that I had to write all\naround the margins of all the pages. \"'\n\n@ ‘find a single record of a good action performed by this cruel bandit.\"\n\nae be continued)\n\naK\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nI feel God as a bursting voice, leading,\nguiding, teaching secretly in the soul temples\nof all men and of all created beings.\n\nThe angel on the right said: ''All the pages of my book are blank.

Lead me to Thyself, who art my home!\n\nin\nTHE ANALYSIS OF THE MIND--Part 2\n\nAs soon as you withdraw your consciousness and energy from the conscious\nplane, you reach the subconscious; then subconsciously induced dreams and\nhallucinations, somnambulism, psychic states, semisuperconscious dreams,\nconsciously induced dreams, and superconsciously induced dreams may be\nexperienced. All these stand in your way just as you are passing from the\nmotion picture house of material or waking consciousness into the motion pic-\nture house of the subconscious. You should not keep the searchlight of your\nattention and your life force centered on the subconscious motion picture house,\nbecause hallucinations and dreams hold your attention and they will keep you\nconcentrated there.\n\nVisions are different. The soul may uSe its intuition together with life\nforce released from bodily activities during the relaxation of sleep to project\ntrue visions on the screen of the subconscious. Visions may show events to\ncome, as the soul can use its intuitive power. to 'photograph\" future happen-\nings. But a vision does not appear until sufficient energy has been relaxed\nfrom the heart and from the ordinary waking consciousness (as in sleep) to pro-\nject it.\n\nSleep brings a state of muscular-sensory relaxation. The subconscious\nmind, working with the ego and a few subconscious films of past experiences,\ncan then produce a dream. The thought film of certain events that has been\nlodged in your brain is vivified by the energy relaxed from the rest of the body\nduring sleep and is used to produce a subconsciously induced dream.\n\nClairaudience comes when your mind is able to concentrate so powerfully\non listening that the tympanum catches vibrations not only from sounds around\nyour body, of which you are normally aware according to the capacity of your\ntympanum, but also sounds you would not ordinarily be able to hear with the\nphysical ears. Those extraordinary sounds come from far off; hence clair-\naudience is sometimes called intuitive hearing.\n\nThe powers of all our senses can be stimulated by the governing power of\nthe mind. It is not the physical eye that sees. It is the mind that uses energy\nto photograph objects through the eye. That energy in the eye is powerful, like\nan X ray. Well, you may say, the X ray can photograph bones in the body; why\nthen, if the eyes are powerful as Xrays, cannot we see the bones inside the\nbody with the unaided eye?

The power in the\neye is more powerful than the X ray, but the sense of sight in the average per-\nson has become limited, owing to hereditary limitations of the mental proces-\n\nses that govern it.\n\nLIFE FORCE The life force is the source of all the rays of sensory percep-\nIS SOURCE tions. The difference between the life force in the body and\nOF ALL RAYS _ the X ray is simply a difference in rate of vibration. Life\n\nforce is semiconscious. The electricity in a bulb does not\nproduce the bulb, but the life force in a little sperm, when united with an ovum,\ndevelops the human body. Since the life force is responsible for making the\nentire body, and is the source of all rays, there is a strong relationship be-\ntween the life force in the body and all the rays around the body.\n\nWe could not eat a stone and derive nourishment therefrom. Why? Not\nbecause the stone is not food--for it may contain elements found in some foods--\nbut because its vibration is not akin to that in the body. Vegetables, water,\nand air are on a vibratory scale that is more or less harmonious to the vibra-\ntion of the body; hence their rays are more quickly absorbed by the body. Rays\nare the first emanations of life force. Gases, chemicals, salts, and minerals\nare but different kinds of rays, each with its own vibration. The Lord has giv-\n\nen us four forms of vibration: solids are the densest; liquids are finer; air is\n\n- still finer; and energy itself is the finest of all.\n\nGod is the Supreme Intelligence. The Word is intelligent vibration, or the\nintelligent Cosmic Energy that has produced protons, electrons, atoms, and so\non. All these are actually rays, and include X ray, electricity, ultraviolet,\nand infrared rays. Rays, according to their rate of vibration, become gases,\nliquids, or solids. A solid might be defined as ''frozen\" liquid; liquid as ''fro-\nzen'' gas; and gas as ''frozen'' rays; rays are ''frozen\"' electricity; and electric-\nity is ''frozen'' energy. What is solid is actually material vibration or energy;\nliquid is simply liquid energy, and gas is gaseous energy. All are forms of\nenergy. All matter is energy in different forms, or different rates of vibration.\n\nCLAIRVOYANCE Clairvoyance is made possible when the life force in the\npower of sight has been attuned to certain vibrations of\nmatter which are finer than those ordinarily perceived with the physical eyes.\nPersons who understand how to make the vibratory power of vision more\npowerful will find that just as an X ray ''sees\" through a wall, so the power of\nsight may be developed to see through solid matter. Those who have developed\nthat vision are called clairvoyant. You can be clairvoyant when you increase\nthe intuitive faculty of the eyes, or when you increase the vibration of the life\nforce inthe eyes. That vibratory power can penetrate into anything, and you\ncan see into the astral counterpart of the physical universe. The universe we\nsee is adream within a dream.

We\nLIKE X RAYS were meant to be able to see with our eyes as one could\n\nsee with a fluoroscope. Why then are we so \"blind''?\nWhy must we use instruments to see through matter? If power were not in the\neye, we could not see through the instruments. We have made ourselves be-\nlieve that we need instruments; but in reality all the sensory powers lie in the\nsoul. ''They seeing see not; and hearing they hear 7100\" (Matthew 13:13). We\nthink that we cannot see behind the scenes without the aid of scientific appli-\nances. Yet if we were only to develop our own visual powers we would be able\nto see that the world is absolutely different from what it now appears to be to\nour limited material vision. What fine rays are dancing! What color there is\nin the sunshine! The spectrum that we see has only seven colors; it is nothing\ncompared to the colors of the astral sphere. Do you know why leaves turn to\na more or less orange color when they are dying? They are retiring to the\nInfinite. Color is a certain rate of vibration. Anything that goes toward Spir-\nit changes to certain colors inthe process. By clairvoyance we may see the\nastral counterparts of matter, if we are developed enough; but in true visions\nwe have the spiritual X-ray power that can penetrate through the astral world\nand see even the saints. Saints are sometimes hidden behind the astral world\nand it requires great concentration to receive their vibratory projections.\n\nIt is possible in two ways to see people who have passed on: If you love\nsomeone very deeply, you may project from within yourself the concept of that\nperson. Or if you think of a person very strongly you may force his astral\nbody to project so that you may see him. By the law of attraction his astral\nbody may be projected, either with or without his knowledge.\n\nThose who are able to see spiritually or clairvoyantly can photograph on\ntheir mental screen the images of real saints that move in the ether. Clair-\nvoyance in itself is not detrimental to spiritual progress; actually in that state\nyour consciousness is reversed from the plane of matter to the plane of Spirit.\nBut certain subconscious pictures or astral images of a lower rate of vibra-\ntion may intrude upon your mental screen and these may be detrimental to soul\nprogress.\n\nRelax your consciousness and energy from preoccupation with the motion\npicture of the material world; and then relax consciousness and energy from\nthe subconscious, which perceives the astral world. That is the way to the\nInfinite. The first process is to withdraw the energy and life force from the\nplane of the senses; then from the subconscious movie house. As you are\nwithdrawing your consciousness from the motion picture of matter, you can\nforget completely the subconscious, and become aware of a higher plane.

The bandit soul, in great glee, at once ordered the bull\nto drive his long horns into the body of the angel leader. Seeing his doom ap-\nproaching, the angel with his assistants began to race through space to find\nshelter behind Heaven's safe gates, fiercely pursued by the bandit. The keep-\ners in Hades sent telepathic broadcasts to Heaven about this terrible outrage.\nArchangels flocked to the rescue, but according to the decree, none could\nwithstand the attack of the flying bull under the command of the wicked bandit.\n\nThe bull entered the pearly gates hot on the heels of the fleeing angels.\nThen Heaven was in anuproar! At last, just as Rakusha on the flying bull\nreached the golden throne of His Majesty, the Lord, the bandit's two hours of\nfreedom were up; the bull suddenly stopped his unbridled goring.

My joys are blaz-\ning into bliss.\neK\nTHE ANALYSIS OF THE MIND--Part 3\n\nDREAM STATE Waking consciousness is the state experienced during\n\none's waking hours; the subconscious mind works then\nas memory. When we are using the conscious mind, the ego orders the senses\nand the muscular processes and the thought processes in the body to produce\ncertain activity. At the same time, just behind the thought processes of the\nconscious mind, the subconscious is working through memory. The conscious\nmind sleeps at night, but the subconscious is always awake--in the daytime as\nmemory, at night as dreams or as the feeling of peace accompanying deep\nsleep.\n\nWhen you do not dream, but sleep peacefully, you are ina state called\n\"semisuperconsciousness.'' When you can consciously retain this dreamless\nstate of subconsciousness, it is called ''superconsciousness.'' The soul mani-\nfests superconsciousness through its intuitive process. Dwelling behind the\nconscious mind are the subconscious and superconscious minds.\n\nThe average person uses the conscious mind most of the time. In dreams\nhe passively experiences the activity of the subconscious mind; and in deep\nsleep he has a glimpse of the semisuperconscious and the superconscious\nstates. One can willfully operate the subconscious mind to produce conscious\nhallucinations; and by meditation one can consciously operate the supercon-\nscious mind to perceive true spiritual visions.\n\nThe ego is the false consciousness of material limitation that the soul\nassumes upon entering the body and becoming engrossed in sense perceptions.\nEgo has many names: ''my body,\" ''my name,\" \"my nationality, '' and so on.\nIts perceptions extend upward into the realm of the subconscious--at the ut-\nmost to the semisuperconscious. Ego perception cannot go beyond into the\nrealm of superconsciousness, because ego is the delusive consciousness of\nidentification with the physical body; whereas superconsciousness is the di-\nrect intuitive perception of the soul when it beholds itself as a reflection of\nSpirit.\n\nVISIONS Superconsciousness and intuition are the same. Intuition is the\ndirect perception of the soul, and is different from reason, which\n\nis dependent upon sense perception. When the soul uses intuition, and intu-\n\nition only, plus the energy that accumulates in the brain during sensory and\n\n"}

These are called visions.\n\nSemivision occurs when the soul uses a mixture of waking consciousness,\nsubconsciousness, and superconsciousness to produce certain half-true visions.\nThey are called ''semivisions'' because during the vision you may also dream.\nYou may be seeing a vision, but you are not able to concentrate on it exclu-\nsively because your attention is partially deflected into the subconscious or\nconscious state. Part is true and part is untrue. The conglomerate experi-\nences of conscious, subconscious, and superconscious minds, plus relaxed\nenergy of the body processes, produce semivisions. Generally speaking, all\nhallucinations may be classified as subconscious experiences; they are detri-\nmental to higher spiritual attainment and the experience of true visions.\n\nSUBCONSCIOUSLY When the ego retires from the chamber of waking con-\n= DREAMS sciousness into the chamber of subconsciousness, it\n\nutilizes relaxed energy produced by sensory relaxa-\ntion, and also certain stored-up comedy or tragedy films of experiences\nlodged in the subconscious mind, to produce dreams,\n\nCONSCIOUSLY At times, perhaps just as you have fallen asleep after\nINDUCED DREAMS _ viewing a harrowing war film, or perhaps a ghost story\n\nfilm that greatly impressed your mind, you have seen\nthese things again; with certain little changés, in adream. The conscious\nstimuli became mixed with certain subconscious experiences, then you pro-\njected them into a dream.\n\nAll experiences that are filmed by the conscious mind through the lenses\nof the senses are stored in the subconscious mind where they may later be\nprojected into that kind of picture or dream. The only difference between con-\nsciously and subconsciously induced dreams is that the consciously induced\ndream immediately follows the conscious experience, whereas, in the subcon-\nsciously induced dream, the record of the experience may have been stored\nfor some time, even years, before it is projected in the form of a dream.\n\nNot all consciously induced dreams are the outcome of certain experiences\nbefore the state of sleep, however. Dreams may also be consciously produced\nin the following way: before you retire at night, make the light dim and begin\nto behold or visualize the area of the room that is lighted, with all the things\nin it. Concentrate with open eyes with the whole attention, but with complete\nrelaxation. Keep on visualizing the room and if you fall asleep doing so, you\nwill find that you have converted this visualization into a conscious dream.\n\nPressure on certain parts of the brain produces certain mental pictures.\nOnce I was sleeping on my side and certain dream-pictures came. I turned\non the other side and immediately the pictures vanished. Then I sat up in the\nmeditation posture, saw superconscious visions, and again slept. It was won-\nderful to experience so many states of consciousness in such a short time.\n\n"}

Superconscious experi-\nences are projected as semiconscious dreams or visions. You can see a\nvision with either open or closed eyes, in daylight or at night; it makes no dif-\nference.

The soul arouses itself, and using\nintuition undergoes an experience so that the ego, when it wakes up and re-\nmembers the dream experience, may be warned or entertained.\n\nHallucinations are produced by the subconscious mind, using certain ener-\ngy released by the relaxed body to produce a mental picture which you can see\nwith open or closed eyes, but which has no corresponding reality.\n\nSomnambulism includes motion of the limbs and other strong muscular\nactivity, accompanied by hallucinations.\n\nDuring unconscious trance you remain outwardly inert, physically uncon-\nscious, but inwardly you stay on the borderland of semisubconsciousness or\n=| The internal experience is peace, plus certain\nsemisuperconsciousness, and sometimes superconscious dreams.\n\nDuring unconsciousness you are unconscious outside, and you may or may\nnot be conscious inside.

He walked all\nover the flower-bedecked garden, but met no one. He went into the dining\nroom of the palace and found steaming hot, delicious food invitingly awaiting\nhim on the table, but no trace of waiters or servants. He thought: ''The Lord\nis good to me; He has materialized this palace, and wonderful food, fit fora\nking, just for me. It is just-as I wanted it.

Just at this moment the servants of the palace,\nwho had been out gambling, rushed in and in great excitement shouted: ''Who\nare you, eating the food of our king who is out hunting and is expected to\narrive any minute?'' The saint, thinking that it was a test of the Lord, replied\nin acalm, loving tone: \"I ama friend of the Great King; I have come here at\nHis command to enjoy royal happiness for a day.\"\n\nThe servants, noting his cosmopolitan air of assurance, took the saint to\nbe truly an august guest of their king, and let him finish the royal dinner.\nThen they ushered him to sleep inthe royal chamber, not dreaming that the\n\"Great King'' the saint referred to was not their earthly ruler, but the Lord.\n\nTwo hours passed. The herald of the king arrived with a message from\nHis Highness, stating that he was detained and would arrive at the end of\nthree hours and would like to have a hot dinner ready.

The ego has limited power, and so it cannot photo-\ngraph distant events. But when the soul banishes its ego consciousness, by\ndissolving its identification with the body, it becomes the pure, true reflec-\ntion of Spirit, the exalted soul cameraman who can photograph the operations\nof the law of causation in the objective world in the light of energy relaxed\nfrom the senses and concentrated in the brain.\n\nIntuition or superconsciousness can project these films of future events\nas visions--glimpses of the fourth dimensional world--that can be seen in\nthe dark spacial movie house behind closed eyes, or even with open eyes in\ndaylight or at night. The power of intuition, using the secret inner liferay\nwithdrawn from the senses, can photograph any subjective dream scene or\nany objective worldly scene, even though it is not present before the physical\neyes, and can project it on the screen of human consciousness as an objective\nvision any time, anywhere, as a true vision (in the human wakeful state), or\nas a true dream (in the subconsci ous dream state).\n\nThe illusory motion picture of worldly objects is produced by God's pow-\ner of cosmic delusion in conjunction with human consciousness and human\nlife. The motion picture of true dreams (dreams which come true) is caused\nby God's power of cosmic intuition operating in conjunction with the soul's\npower of pure intuition or superconsciousness, and pure life, withdrawn from\nthe senses and concentrated in the brain, reflected from Spirit in ego-less\nsoul.\n\nSuperconsciously induced dreams are those in which the soul takes a real\nintuitive experience and from that intuition projects a dream. Such dreams\nare projected by the soul operator on the screen of subconsciousness in the\npassive state of sleep. In this case the soul does not take film from the sub-\nconscious (as in ordinary dreams) but photographs events from the ether by\nintuition, and projects them as superconscious dreams in the dark chamber @\nof subconsciousness.\n\n"}

When the human consciousness and energy are\nconcentrated in the brain during the relaxation of sleep, the blind ego produces\nuntrue motion pictures of dreams, whereas the pure soul, by concentrating\npure consciousness and energy during the relaxation of sleep can produce true\ndreams. When one liberates the soul by practicing meditation during the wake-\nful state one can learn to project true dreams in the subconscious state. An\nadvanced yogi finds his soul able to withdraw life and energy from the senses\nconsciously, and to photograph future events or distant scenes and film them\nas Ssuperconscious visions, which may then be viewed with closed or open\neyes in the wakeful state also.\n\nCOMPOSITION Your usual habit of sleep indicates your usual state of\n\nOF DREAMS mind. There is a way to distinguish all these different\nstates. These are the fine things that you should know, be-\n\ncause they are 21] roads to Self-realization.\n\nNever forget that there is the element of energy in dreams--energy com-\nbined with imagination. Without energy you cannot see. Energy materializes\nthe thought. God's thought, combined with Cosmic Energy, was materialized\nto produce this universe. He shows us that if we have control over energy and\nconsciousness even as He does, we cancreate just as He does. Ina passive\nstate, with energy relaxed from the senses and concentrated in the brain, we\ncan create miniature dream pictures. =” हु ।\n\nBehind nature is Cosmic Intelligence, plus energy. Energy is the miss-\ning link between matter and consciousness. Energy and consciousness are\neverything. Likewise, God shows us in dreamland that we can create a repli-\nca of this world, provided we have the necessary concentration of conscious-\nness and energy. It is also true that if energy could somehow be kept away\nfrom the brain, you would have no hallucinations. If you are peaceful and\ncalm every day, you will not have dreams. But by consciously inducing ener-\ngy in the brain and controlling it properly, you may See visions.\n\nWhen by self-control during meditation the devotee astrally disconnects\nthe life force from the sensory nerves, it begins to flow inward and becomes\nfocused into an opalescent light at the point between the eyebrows. This in-\nward astral flow, and the inner light, are the oblations of human wisdom to\nits ancestors of soul, ego, and intuition. The human wisdom must offer these\nvitalities to the soul faculties with the oblations of inwardly flowing spiritual\nperceptions and the light of the spiritual eye, or the soul faculties will remain\ndormant, degradingly undeveloped.\n\nDreams are made of consciousness, relaxed energy, and an idea. The\nidea is the film, the relaxed energy is the current and the ego is the projector.\nFor example: In the projection of a dream, the subconsciousness is the\nscreen; the relaxed energy from the nerves gathers in the brain, and the film\n"}

The medulla oblongata serves as the projection booth. So whena\n\nperson is dreaming his energy has relaxed into the brain; the ego is taking\n\nthe current of relaxed energy and passing it and its ego consciousness through\n\nthe experiences in the brain cells, and these are being projected as subcon-\n\nscious dreams; i.e., the ego, plus relaxed energy, plus experiences located\n\nin the brain, produce images. |\n\nNightmare dreams come under the heading of subconsciously induced\ndreams. During a nightmare, more energy will be used by the heart and the\ncirculation, and the breath will be more excited than in superc onsciously in-\nduced dreams, which have a rather peaceful effect on the body. During a\nsuperconscious dream your breath, heart, and all physical and vital process-\nes will be decidedly less active than when you have a nightmare.\n\nVISIONS--DREAMS __ Sleep is unconscious sensory and muscular relaxation.\nYou do not know how the energy retires, for it has been\npassively, or unconsciously, relaxed by you. When your mind becomes pas-\nsive and your energy relaxes from the brain, the relaxed energy passes through\ngrooves of the subconscious, where the experiences that you see in the ordinary\n\ndream are stored.\n\nVisions are produced when you are able consciously to withdraw the energy\nfrom the muscles and heart region and direct it to the spiritual eye as taught\nin preceding Lessons on concentration and meditation. As soon as supercon-\nscious vision comes, your breath and heart will be still. Semivisions are\nthose that are not consciously induced but have a touch of the superconscious.\nA superconscious dream is materialized like a vision, but in it the supercon-\nsciousness is not directly active, operating only through subconsciousness.\n\nHY PNOSIS--SOMNAMBULISM Some students confuse hypnotism with som-\nnambulism. The two are quite different.\nIn somnambulism ego not only uses certain subconscious films to produce a\npicture, but also employs the muscles and limbs to act out the movie. It is\nsubconscious control of the conscious processes. When you are consciously\nच. you know that you are. consciously willing yourself to do so. In som-\nnambulism such movement is controlled by the subconscious; it is very dan-\ngerous. Certain subconscious experiences take hold of the conscious process-\nes and the body works out that subconscious impulse.\n\nIn hypnosis, however, by certain suggestions someone else arouses your\nsubconscious mind and makes it control the conscious mind. This state usual-\nly lasts only a little while. If you are fully under the spell of hypnotism, the\nhypnotizer is able to make you think and say what he is suggesting. The yogis\nof India claim that hypnosis takes away mental freedom. Hypnosis makes use\nof the subconscious; the danger lies in the repeated overpowering of the | ।\n\n"}

''Tramp'' souls are\nalways moving in the ether, seeking passive mentalities through which they\ncan express. Hence the danger in \"letting the mind go blank.\" This is quite\n\na different process from that employed in meditation, in which a conscious,\ncontrolled effort of will and attention are employed to stop the flow of restless\n(1. €. , uncontrolled) thoughts and to concentrate instead on some idea of God\n\nwhich the devotee desires to meditate upon and intuitively realize. A true\nguru is able to point out step-by-step methods (such as the Self-Realization\nFellowship Hong-Sau and Om meditation techniques) by which the God-seeking\ndevotee may safely attain his goal.\n\nSaints and seers of all times have described the result of correct medi-\nES as a state of exalted awareness, of blissful consciousness--not mental\nblankness.

God has given you the power to create, so\ncreate with your mind the things you want most.\n\nWhile you are dreaming everything is real to you. The only difference\nbetween this world and the dreamland is that the world is a more sustaining\ndream. God is suggesting a universe to us and we cannot get rid of that\nthought because it is so powerful. God is dreaming through us. When your\nthought becomes elevated enough to be in tune with God's thought, then you\nwill be able to realize that this life is but a dream. You must first lift your\nconsciousness to the plane of God. Then you will wake up in the Infinite.

To lecture,\nto run a religious organization, to earn money, or to sell something, requires\nthe application of business principles.\n\nThe true and ultimate success of any business depends upon its having an\nefficient head and capable associates. Sometimes a man tries to operate his\nbusiness alone in order to keep expenses down, but most large successful con-\ncerns are of necessity run by a group of qualified men. Whena business run\nby a single individual begins expanding, the owner has to employ others in\norder to conduct it adequately; but no matter who his business associates are,\nthe owner of a business should always keep the controlling interest in his own @\nhands.\n\nBUSINESS ASSOCIATES Since many companies that fail do so owing to a lack\nSHOULD PRODUCE of qualified business associates, it is necessary that\nBEST OF REFERENCES prospective employees and members of the firm be\n\njudged by their previous record of success and their\npresent demonstration of creative intelligence. Silken-tongued, sleek, but inef-\nficient employees are abundant and easy to find, but such may ruin you complete-\nly. Avoid also as business associates those persons who foolishly ''rush in\nwhere angels fear to tread. '' Such people will retard the progress of your busi-\nness, if they do not entirely ruin it.\n\nIn order to select administrative employees with superior qualities you\nshould depend not only on references but use also keen vision, careful observa-\ntion, intelligence, and open-mindedness to support your own judgment and\n\nintuition.\n\nTEST ABILITY To attract honest, loyal, friendly, intelligent employees\n\nAND CHARACTER who will make your business their business, and your ambi-\n\nOF APPLICANTS tion their ambition, is the real way to conduct a business\nsuccessfully. Look for creative ability, intelligence, and\n\nabove all trustworthiness in your business associates. It is good to take young\n\nmen into partnership with you and teach them your business if they will agree to ©\n\ncooperate fully with you.\n\n"}

Be sure to\ntest him out directly or indirectly through other friends, former business asso-\nciates, or even detectives, if his duties are to involve the handling of money.\nSubject him to temptation and see how he reacts. Try through mutual friends\nto ascertain whether your business associates ever talk against you, and find\nout what their intentions are. Forgive every minor fault twice or thrice, but\nnever overlook treachery. A business associate who is treacherous toward you\nonce will repeat the same act when you are least expecting it, and may do irrepa-\nrable damage. If a business associate drinks too much, or otherwise dissipates,\nand shows no shame when criticized for his conduct, excuse him several times,\ngiving him a chance to repent and reform. If he still fails to show signs of\ncontriteness and improvement, discharge him.\n\nHONESTY AND LOYALTY Don't employ a slow-to-understand person or a\nIN BUSINESS RELATIONS mentally and physically lazy person. A mental-\n\nly lazy person is one who grunts and moans, and\nconsiders it a terrible expenditure of energy if he takes any time to create, plan.\nor think about your business success.\n\nDo not keep a dishonest person in your employ. You never can tell what\nsuch a person might do to your business. Be sure to find out confidentially\nfrom the previous employer about the character, ability, and honesty of the\nman you are going to engage. Onthe other hand, if you are an employee and\nyou repeatedly hear something very detrimental about your employer, then try\nto find another position so that you can stay away from him altogether.\n\nNever let a friend take advantage of you just because you are his friend.\nBusiness must be conducted strictly on business principles. Those business\nassociates who stand by you in your troubles and business depressions are your\nbest friends. Never take into business with you a friend who is inclined to be\ntoo familiar, and who probably would capitalize on that intimacy and not take\nnecessary orders from you or follow your advice.\n\nREAD CHARACTER THROUGH THE EYES\n\n~ Intuitive Way: Remember, the whole history of a man is in his brain, and\n\nthe contents of the brain are reflected in the eyes. The\neyes are the index of the mind, character, habits, and soul of a person. Beware\nof shifting, untrustworthy eyes, cruel eyes, and crafty, sarcastic, revengeful\neyes. Beware of hate-projecting eyes, and lack of straight-forwardness in the\neyes. If you feel an automatic, intuitive shrinking after looking fully in the\neyes of an individual, then beware of that person. Leave him or her alone.\n\nThe Spiritual Way: After deep meditation--while concentrating your attention\nat the point between the eyebrows--with closed eyes visual-\n\nize the eyes of your prospective employee or partner and study the feeling that\n\narises in your heart.

All difficulties\ncan be overcome, but only by your continued planning and pertinacity. Refuse\nto acknowledge defeat and you will win. If you don't succeed in the business\nyou are trying for some time, then try something else, and keep on trying\nuntil you succeed in something. Try to make good in the line of business that\nyou have some knowledge of, or in which you have had some experience.\n\nKK\n\nA GREAT FAILURE WHO MADE SUCCESS HIS SLAVE\n\n(The following true story is about a man who was a perennial failure, but\nwho, by pursuing Self-Realization Fellowship teachings, was able ultimately to\nremove the real cause of his failures and to make success his slave. For\n\nobvious reasons his real name is not given here.\n--Paramahansa Yogananda)\n\nJust as there are naturally successful people, so there are habitual fail-\nures. My friend and student John was such a \"'born\" failure. He was young,\nintelligent, diligent, and painstaking in his pursuit of moneymaking, but it\nseemed that no matter what job or business he gave his attention to, the result\nwas always complete failure. Penniless and harassed by creditors, deserted\nby his other friends, he sought the shelter of my advice.\n\nI questioned John as to the cause of his troubles. He replied: \"817, 1am\na great failure. For some mysterious reason, not only do 7 lose my job wher-\never 1am employed, but usually my employer loses his business too after\nemploying me. I have come to dread seeking a job for fear of destroying the\nbusiness of my new employer through the deadly influence of my failure vibra-\ntion. I figure that I would lose the job ultimately in any case, forif the busi-\nness goes bankrupt after employing me, they would have to let me go. I have\nno right to cause the business failures of other men merely because of my\nconnection with them. Iam labeled a failure by all my friends, and as a result\nof my experiences I myself am thoroughly convinced that Ican never succeed. @\nI am indeed the greatest of failures.\"\n\n"}

Please\ntake me out before it goes on the rocks completely. I shall lose my job anyway\nwhen it fails. Perhaps my resignation now will save the business from destruc -\n\ntion through my unlucky vibration. \"\n\nI laughed and paid no attention to what John said, but told him to continue\nhis affirmation of success and to hold on to his job. After a fortnight John\ncame to me one evening, and with a sigh of relief exclaimed: \"It happened!\"\n\"What happened?''I asked. \"Well, the business concern I was in collapsed,\nas Itold you it would. \"'\n\nI remonstrated: \"Every night and every morning, when you have been say-\ning the affirmation, 'Day by day I am getting better and better, ' you have only\nbeen parroting the words, because in the background of your mind a little octo-\npus of obstinate doubt has kept on mentally saying: ''You little simpleton, day\nby day, in every way, you know that you are getting worse and worse, no mat-\nter how much you repeat that you are getting better.' Isn't that true?'' He\nadmitted that I was right.\n\nI advised John to be sure to cast out all strong negative vibrations as soon\nas they visited his mind, especially during a positive affirmation, because a\nconvinced conscious mind influences the subconsciousness, which in turn--\nthrough the law of inner psychological reciprocity--influences the conscious\nmind by the power of habit.\n\n\"However, ''I said, \"'the repeated affirmation of a positive mental habit\nuntil it is established in the subconscious mind only removes the subconscious\nmental barrier created by discouragement from repeated failure; it cannot\ncreate a new cause of success. Success is conditioned by creative ability,\nenvironment, and prenatal and postnatal habits and tendencies; only if you con-\ntact the all powerful, unlimited superconscious mind can you create a new\ncause to bring about the success that has thus far eluded you. ''\n\nWell, I succeeded in getting John into another, bigger, business concern.\nAfter six months (the longest period he had ever held a job) he said to me one\nevening: ''Sir, get me out quick. Business is getting pretty bad.\"\n\nI paid no attention to John's misgivings and relentlessly told him to go on\nwith his job. One day a few weeks later John, smiling wryly, told me: \"517,\nthe second position you got me into has evaporated also. \"I pretended to feel\nsorrowful at his plight, but did not look puzzled; and I calmly said: \"Never\nmind, John, I will get you another job.\"\n"}

A year passed and nothing happened, although almost\nevery week John wanted to give up his job, expecting that he would cause the\ncollapse of the third and biggest concern in which I had placed him.\n\nFinally, Iasked John to invest his money in a business of his own. He was\nat once overwhelmed by fear and remonstrated with me: ''There you go again!\nIf I invest the money I have saved I am sure to lose it.'' I firmly assured him,\n\"Of course you must invest your money and energy in some good project, like\nthe order supplying of stationery, which requires no large investment nor over-\nhead, and Iam sure that you will succeed. \"'\n\nWell, John found himself, in the course of a few years, in possession of\nlarge capital assets, including ownership of a few chain stores.\n\nWhen John was thoroughly convinced of his success, he found himself\nsucceeding in everything that he undertook. One day he laughingly said:\n\"Through God and you I am now changed from a great failure to a great success.\n1 am a man who has conquered failure. But though I can understand how my\nown repeated failures were due to lack of understanding on my part, I cannot\nreason out why I succeeded in demolishing the business of other people by the\npower of my failure vibration. ''\n\n‘You did not cause the collapse of the businesses you were in,'' I replied.\n\"The law of attraction, which governs people of like vibrations, operated in\neach case. Your being a failure attracted you to a business about to fail, and\nvice versa. Two lighted bombs rolling down the side of the hill together are\nlikely to explode at the same time. You were a failure and the business was\nabout to fail too. So by the law of inner affinity, you went down the hill of fail-\nure together to explode at the same time. \"'\n\nLet it be remembered, in connection with the foregoing story, that absolute\nsuccess signifies ''the power to create at will what you need by developing your\nunlimited superconscious power.'' This superconscious power can be awakened\nby knowing the definite technique of meditation, as taught by the God-realized\nmasters of India. India has specialized in the art of controlling the mental\nmachinery of the mind factory in order to produce prosperity, health, success,\nwisdom, and God contact at any time, at will, and without limitation.\n\nWestern brothers and sisters need to learn that the mind is greater than\nits inventions.

Remain\nalways open before me, that I avoid the pitfalls in the path of life and\nkeep to the highway that leads to Thy palace of peace.\n\nEK\nHOW TO DEVELOP CREATIVE INTUITION\n\nIntuition is that directly perceiving faculty of the soul which at once knows\nthe truth about everything. Intuitive perception requires no medium of sense\nexperience or reason. Intuition connects true reason with the ego and soul.\nLike many of his other divine powers, man's intuitional faculty remains unde-\nveloped in the average person. Without exercise, no faculty can be developed.\nThe nature of intuition should be better understood, and methods of developing\nit considered.\n\nEveryone demonstrates the power of intuition more or less. It peeps\nforth through the loopholes of calmness produced in the interwoven materials\n\nof thoughts and sensory perceptions. Intuition gives knowledge of things with- .\n\nout requiring any objective or inferential data. We all know this from exam-\nples in our own lives.\n\nTrue intuition comes to you as a calm, haunting feeling, as distinguished\nfrom disturbed emotional obsessions. This intuition comes to you as an inner\nvoice, or whispering. You must be careful to distinguish that inner guidance\nfrom the delusive fanciful voices of the subconscious mind. Real intuition can\nnever be wrong. It does not consist merely in believing a thing firmly or\ndoggedly, but in knowing it directly and unmistakably. Intuition does not con-\ntradict but is always supported by a right sense of perception, reason, and\ninference. All things known by intuition are invariably true, both materially\nand intellectually; but the opposite is not always true.\n\nSEMI-INTUITION Depending upon an undeveloped intuitional faculty is\n\ndangerous. Errors are made by people who fail to dis-\ntinguish between a real intuitional feeling and their convictions born of intel-\nlectual experience, superstition, partial uniformity of events seeming to jus-\ntify the same prediction, habits, shrewdness, or the delusion of ''because it\nhappened many times before it must happen again. \"'\n\nMen of keen understanding and women of pure, undisturbed feeling usually\nhave semi-developed intuition as a result of an unconscious but proper devel-\naT of reason amd feeling. Pure reason and calm feeling lead to intuition.\nDistorted, skeptical reason and emotional feeling overcloud intuition. There-\nfore, the first requisite in developing intuition is to calmly reason and calmly\nfeel everything. Never be skeptical; never be excited or emotional.\n\n"}

Or sometimes you feel all day long that something good or bad\nis going to happen; then, when it happens, you are astonished that your premo-\nnition proved valid. These are examples of the sudden uncontrolled appear-\nance and working of the all-knowing power of intuition buried within.\n\nMAN MUST DEVELOP THE In order to live rightly and have a successful\nPOWER OF THE SENSES life, it is necessary to develop the powers of\n\nthe five senses of touch, smell, hearing,\nsight, and taste, by stimulating them with concentration. Most important is\nthe development of the all-knowing faculty of intuition. Just as there are\nseveral windows in a house, so there are five windows of outer physical senses\nand three inner windows of consciousness fitted in the house of life. Through\nthese the soul contacts the outer world. If the windows in a house are frosted,\nvisibility becomes poor. Inthe same way, if the sense and mind windows are\nbefogged with ignorance and sensual and mental weaknesses, human under-\nstanding becomes clouded.\n\nThe average person blunders in his search for knowledge because he uses\nhis undeveloped sensory perceptions and the power of inference, which is\nbuilt on the data furnished by the senses. If the data is wrong, the inference\nis bound to be wrong. For instance; seéing a cloud of dust on a hill in the dis-\ntance, one may take it to be a fire, although it is not a fire. The power of the\nsenses depends upon the sense organs, and the power of inference depends up-\non the senses for information; but intuition is knowledge from within, and does\nnot depend upon any data offered by the senses or the mind.\n\nMost people, equipped with poor senses and an undeveloped mind, make\nmistakes in everything--from the study of health and business up to the study\nof philosophy and religion. Thousands of persons make wrong investments\nbecause their thinking is distorted by greed-befogged concentration instead of\nbeing scientifically guided by intuition. Some people follow a hunch once ina\nwhile. Supermen--those who live in the superconscious state--use their in-\ntuition in everything they do.\n\nTRAIN YOUR INTUITION Sense perception, inferential reasoning, and\nTO SOLVE PROBLEMS agama (intuition) constitute the whole proof\n\nabout the nature of anything. The word agama\nis supposed by many to mean \"authority of scriptures, '' but this interpretation\nis not correct because authoritative statements, from however sacred a source,\nhave to be received through the medium of sense perception (hearing, seeing),\nor through studying or inferential reasoning. Hence, agama really means\n\"soul-perception. '' This intuition may awaken memories in you through a cer-\ntain taste or smell associated with some event that you have experienced.\n"}

When you are successful in doing that, then employ your intuition\n\nin the solution of big problems.\n\nThe angels of heaven, roaming in the hall of Cosmic Consciousness, have\nneither eyes, nor ears, yet they can see, hear, and soforth. They can do\neverything by means of intuition, which is their all-seeing eye, all-hearing\nears, all-tasting mouth, all-smelling nostrils, and all-space-feeling touch.\n\nIn the hall of Cosmic Consciousness no one sees, hears, smells, tastes, or\ntouches, for everyone feels and does everything through intuition. When you\ntoo are able to feel everything this way, you will understand that intuitive feel-\ning constitutes the body, eyes, ears, intelligence and consciousness of the\ninvisible angels.\n\nMeditate regularly for at least half an hour every morning and before go-\ning to bed at night. Then sit quietly after meditation, feeling a calm peace.\nThe feeling that makes you enjoy peace immediately after or during deep medi-\ntation is called intuition. If you keep exercising this power daily, it will de-\nvelop itself and will be ready for your service every day. Sometimes during\nthe day, this intuition will seize your attention, even when you are not thinking\nabout it, and will foretell future events. An intuitional forecast about a given\nobject may be seen ina vision. But to tune in with the real intuition of the\nsoul, first be sure to rid yourself of all hallucinations born of negative silence-- | ।\nor imaginary silence, which is different from the positive silence enjoyed by\nthose who practice real techniques of meditation, such as are taught by Self-\nRealization Fellowship.\n\nALL-SEEING POWER Those persons who seek any kind of success, no\n\nOF INTUITION matter what it is, should first practice for several\nmonths the method suggested in this Lesson. When\n\nthey feel that their intuition is well developed, they should sit still and be calm,\n\nand feel that power of intuition immediately before they seek to solve any im-\n\nportant business, social, or spiritual problems.\n\nRemember, even the most intelligent man and the most poised woman can\nmake mistakes in investments, or in choosing the right vocation, the right\nbusiness associates, the right companions in their lives. This shows that\nreason and feeling, no matter how pure, are not intuition. That 18 why self-\nsufficient business men, and semi-intuitive, feeling-guided women should be-\nware. In order to know the truth about a business, it is necessary to see,\nhear, and judge the problems. Even then you may arrive at wrong conclusions.\nBut if you use the all-seeing power of intuition, you will not have to investigate\nanything, for you will know about it instantly. God has no eyes, ears, or mind\nthat depend upon any senses. He has the all-knowing power of intuition. By\nthis power He knows instantly anything that He wants to know. That is why,\nthrough this omnipresent power, God has the power to see, hear, smell, taste,\nor touch anything, anywhere. Man being made in the image of God, has this\n\n"}

Then concen-\ntrate simultaneously at the point between the eyebrows (Christ Consciousness\nGenter) and the heart. Lastly, ask God to direct your intuition, so that you\nmay know what you should do about your problems.\n\nUsually, persons who want educational, business, or spiritual success\nthink that they can gain their objective through the study of books, or by at-\ntending business college or theological seminaries. Most Western professors\nthink that education lies in pumping ideas into the brains of students. The\nEastern masters first evaluate the receptive faculties of an individual before\nthey consider teaching him anything. They say that, just as you cannot pour\nan ocean into a cup, so you cannot instill specific knowledge into deficient\nminds that have only a limited power of sensibility and understanding.\n\nMany books and courses of study are prescribed for students in Western\nschools, but nothing is taught them about concentration and the development\nof the sixth sense--intuition.

There\n\n| । ~ -- is always God's way, the perfect, harmonious way--the answer to His call to\nreturn to His house of Oneness.\n\nMKS\n\nLESSON NO. 53 Love is not merely an emotion. It is a very real sub-\n\nstance. When it is consciously directed, it finds its\nway unerringly to its mark, and is the one ''weapon\" that cannot be withstood.\nYou may try many ways to find God, but He will elude you until you pour forth\ngreat love to Him from your heart.\n\nIf you feel that you are not making the spiritual progress that you should,\nthe first thing todo is tointrospect. Take stock of yourself and your habits,\nand find out what is standing in your way. Often it is inertia, or lack of defi-\nnite, undivided effort and attention. Sometimes there are habits that need to\nbe weeded out of the garden of your life, so that true happiness may become\nmore firmly rooted.\n\nYou should gain complete dominion over yourself and all your activities\nby self-discipline and by deeper and deeper meditation. If you can hold your\npeace and be calmly active and actively calm in all you do, you have identi -\nfied yourself with your real Self that dwells always in the inner chamber of\npeace. No matter what happens, through all experiences and seeming dis-\n\n@ turbances, your eyes and your whole attitude should always reflect restful-\nness and poise.

As the body becomes like\nthat upon which it feeds and to which it gives attention, it has become gross\nand dependent upon outward sources for sustenance, instead of upon God's\ncosmic energy. The beautiful body that God created to be charged by cosmic\nenergy, and to live in an unlimited divine state, has become caged within the\nbars of the senses, and so is subject to suffering if the senses are not gratified.\n\nLESSON NO, 54 .

You must consciously still all outer\nactivities of mind and body, and give recognition to God by contacting Him in\nmeditation. 2. Then hold that consciousness of divine identity, that presence\nof God, in your body temple, and subjugate all outer activities to that inner\nconsciousness. By daily discipline and eternal vigilance, train your mind\nand body to obey instantly your God-identified consciousness. You are not the\nbody; you are not the mind. ''Thow art That.\"'\n\nWhenever you want something with great intensity of desire and feeling,\nit is constantly in the background of your mind, no matter what you are doing\nor where you are. By unceasingly revolving in your mind, the thought of this\ndesire gains momentum and dynamic power. This ''mental whisper\" 18 far | ।\nmore effective than a mechanical prayer, which is no deeper than lip move-\nment.\n\nMentally whisper your love to God constantly, all through the day's activi-\nties. You are never too busy for this. When your desire for God and your love\nfor Him become sufficiently deep and intense, He can no longer withhold Him-\nself from you.

Also follow the rules for right human behavior and self-\ndiscipline, for this is the way to bring your outer self into complete control.\nThen you can reclaim the \"lost'' image of God hidden within you. By heeding\nHis intuitional responses to your mental questions, you can control your des-\n\ntiny.\n\nLESSON NO. 56 As electricity is stored ina battery, so life force is stored\n\nin the human brain. And the similarity does not end there,\nfor the radiant energy stored in the brain is electrical in nature. Brain energy\nis constantly being used in every movement and thought, whether thoughts are\nconsciously willed or created by so-called involuntary or automatic running of\nthe human machinery. Hence a great amount of energy is needed. Through\npractice of the Self-Realization Fellowship Energization Exercises, energy\nmay be consciously drawn from its limitless Source.\n\nThe brain is also a mental ''radio, ' since it has the power both to receive\nand to broadcast messages. In order to use this power, one must keep his\nmental ''radio'' properly attuned and in good condition. Now and then our mind\nradio gets mysteriously tuned in with the thoughts of others, and we have what\nwe call ‘hunches. '' Occasionally, when we think intensely of others, and of\ncertain things we wish them to know, they do receive our thoughts. But this\nis not the usual thing: - ---- ---------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ---- - te\n\nHowever, by keeping the mental radio in good order, you may consciously\nbroadcast and receive at will. Restlessness, noisy passions, and sense-rule\nare very harmful to the mental radio. Deep calmness and silence, the Tech-\nnique of Concentration, and physical discipline are essential to perfect attune-\nment. When the hands are lifted up in the air, the sensitive fingers act as\nantennae to receive or broadcast thoughts. Try to feel the vibrations through\nyour hands. As sounds pass through ether, our thoughts pass through Cosmic\nConsciousness, which pervades our souls and all material substances. Your\nfirst attunement should be with God, and your first broadcast: 'Father, make\nme realize again that Thou and I are One. ''\n\nLESSON NO. 57 Worry thoughts are a habit. They act like a poisonous\n\ndrug on the mind. It is a good plan to go on short worry\nfasts to begin with, taking an hour in the morning and at noon, and three hours\nin the evening. Absolutely refuse to allow a single worry thought to enter your\nmind during these periods. Then extend the period to a whole day, thentoa\nweek, a month. Soon you will have broken the insidious hold of these habitual\nworry thoughts, and you will discard them forever.\n\nThen you should have good mental food for the convalescing mind. First\nyou should have laughter and joy. Associate with joyous persons, for joy and\nlaughter are contagious. Add courage and wisdom to this diet.

Physical attraction 6. Idealism\n\n2. Aesthetic attraction 7. Emotional liking\n३, Mental unity 8. Material greed\n4, Vocational likeness 9. Social position\n5. Moral inclination 10. Call of the soul\n\nPersons who plan to marry should give careful study to, and understand,\nthe basis of their impulses with regard to each other. They should be certain\nthat their desire to marry is based upon those good influences which grow and\nstrengthen as the years pass, and which cement a relationship into true unity\nin the love of God. They should unsparingly pull out of their garden of love\nall such weeds as mere physical attraction, material greed, and any selfish\ndesire for the material possessions or advantages that the marriage might\nbring.\n\nCommon likes and dislikes should be taken into consideration, but these\nmight change in time. Physical beauty changes; so if love is based chiefly upon\nadmiration for a beautiful face and body, some day love may fade. Money,\nsocial position, emotional excitement are poor foundations for a continued,\nhappy married life. Unless there is true inner beauty, and the call of soul to\nsoul, it is far better for one to wait and seek further for a life mate.\n\nLESSON NO. 59 Real love of the heart and soul is divine love.

And so God teaches divine love\nthrough the medium of idealized human love.\n\nIf the human marriage relation is fettered by mere sex attraction, it may\nnever rise to the heights of pure happiness and lasting love; and it will soon\ndisintegrate. Physical harmony is necessary in the marriage relation, but it\ntakes third place in importance.\n\nMental unity is second in importance. It requires mental breadth and un-\nderstanding, and must include common interests and liking in activities. Every\nwoman should learn to emanate sincere smiles and wear the rouge of sincerity\nand true love on her face. She should learn to attract others by spiritual mag-\nnetism only, for this will draw spiritual souls. She should acquire the real\nmagnetic qualities of wisdom, understanding, consideration, true learning and\nall-round efficiency.\n\nSoul unity must be foremost. In this is embodied the urge for mutual\nspiritual progress and perfection, toward ultimate, complete union in God. In\nreal soul marriage, love is undying and unconditional. As real love increases,\nphysical consciousness decreases; and then human love changes into divine love,\nall-complete love, in which souls are wedded to God.\n\nSome souls do not need to pass through the fusing flame of human love.\nThey have already attained oneness with God. Human-ties are not necessary\nto them, for they know, \"I and my Father are One.''

Forgiveness and forgetfulness of all errors must be the rule.\nSilently correct your own faults, and remove their cause from within yourself.\nIf your mate displays unbecoming speech or action, refrain from indulging in\nlike behavior, for in so doing you only soil yourself in the squalor of undisci-\nplined feelings.\n\nIf it is necessary to part company, do so in kindness and understanding,\nand seal your lips forever from unkind recriminations.\n\nMeditate deeply and always remain in the impregnable castle of happiness.\n\nLESSON NO. 62 It is only through love that man may find his way back to\n\nGod. God is the pure essence of love in father, mother,\nand child. Love is always pure, divine, but it becomes colored by the person-\nality of the outer human self--as clear water appears colored if placed ina\ncolored glass vessel; the vessel itself must be crystal clear in order to re-\nflect the purity of its contents. A pure mountain stream flowing down through\na clay river bed or through contaminated soil takes on impurities. Remember\nthat although the water itself is pure, it must then be filtered to remove the\nsediment and contamination. Conjugal love, passing through the filter of pa-\nrental love, expands and expresses more of its divine qualities as it flows in-\nto a third heart--that of a child.\n\nThe relation between parents and children is a metaphysical inexorable\nordinance of God. It is in accordance with a divine plan. Mutual regard is\nthe altar of unity through which God's love is manifested.\n\nParents should look upon their child as the honored temple wherein their\nconjugal love will be purified and expanded. Kindness and strong loving guid-\nance should always prevail--never harshtreatment. Children should consider\n\n"}

Obedi-\nence and respect should activate their behavior.\n\nFamily life is a character-building corporation. God is the president,\nand divine love is the product. However, it is not necessary for everyone to\nmarry to perfect human love. Human love may be changed into divine love by\nthe superior way of wedlock of the individualized soul with the Spirit in the\ntemple of meditation.\n\nLESSON NO, 63 In order to overcome stage fright, it is a good thing to\nunderstand the causes of it, and then take care to elim-\n\ninate them. Fear is the all-inclusive reason. The causes which generate\nfear are:\n\n1. Infrequent performance. 5. Lack of mastery of technique.\n\n2. Timidity. 6. Overeating before a performance.\n3. Nervousness. 7. Drinking or using narcotics.\n\n4. Inferiority complex.\n\nMaster the best techniques that you know; then study and practice the\nfollowing special exercises and methods for overcoming stage fright:\n\n_1) Deep breathing, while concentrating at the point between the eye-_\n\nbrows, just before a performance.\n\n2) Mentally visualize yourself giving a masterful performance before\nan enthralled audience.\n\n3) Take a bath about two hours before your performance.\n\n4) Be humble.\n\n5) Study the best technique with the best teacher available.\n\n6) Eat sparingly several hours before a performance, else the energy\nwill be diverted from the brain to the work of digestion.\n\n7) Avoid drink or narcotics. Become intoxicated with inspiration.\n\nInspiration consciously stimulates feeling, will, reason, and all the\nsenses to do their best willingly, with the feeling of joy.\n\nAbove all things, get your mind quiet, and remember that all the power\nyou need is within you. No matter what you do, remember that God is the\nflood that fills all the channels of your powers. God is working through you.\n\nLESSON NO, 64 An understanding of what actually takes place in healing\nis a great aid in establishing a consciousness in man's\nmind of the identity of his own life with a Cosmic Life.\n\nAny method of healing is effective according to its power to arouse or\nstimulate the life force. Medicines and physical manipulations are relatively\ngross methods, whereas electricity and rays are of a finer nature and affect\n\n"}

The cosmic electric force is the direct source of life.\nAnd here the body of man may well be compared to an automobile battery,\nwhich depends for its life upon two sources, chemicals, and an electrical re-\ncharge. In man the cosmic electrical force is the direct source of life, and\nconverts the food, oxygen, and sunlight into living energy.\n\nAn extremely important point to recognize and remember is that the life\nwith which you are charged is a conscious, intelligent cosmic ray. It comes\nto you as pure life energy. What you do with it, how you direct or misdirect\nit, whether you allow its flow to manifest in health and happiness, or thwart\nit into inactivity, causing distress and disease, is up to you. Ignorance is the\nroot-cause of all disease and so-called sin. Refusal to listen to the silent\nVoice within, which is ever trying to make itself heard above the willful clam-\nor of the senses, is the cause of badly scorched fingers.\n\nBuild a temple of silence within yourself. There you will find God on the\naltar of your love, and there you will hear His voice. For, though all else\nmay fail to reach Him, love will never fail.\n\nLESSON NO, 65 While physical methods, medicines, and rays all have\ntheir place in the evolution of healing methods by their\nlesser or greater power to stimulate the life force, the supreme factor is\nthe mind. The mind is the builder of the body from its creation. Remember\nhere that the mind with its three divisions, is only one mind, in reality. Only\naccording to the plane of mind on which an individual functions may a certain\nmethod of mental healing be effective. For instance, the imaginative type, in\nwhom the subconscious is predominant, will find autosuggestion most effective;\nthe logical, reasoning person, through an understanding knowledge of the inter-\ndependence of mind and body, will refuse to accept pain and disease, in the\nrealization that if the mind refuses to accept it, it cannot exist.\n\nRemember also you can make little headway with listlessness and half-\nhearted efforts. Will is a potent factor in any undertaking. Enthusiasm and\nwill draw in fresh supplies of energy.\n\nUsing spiritual affirmations with attention and understanding makes direct\nconnection with the ever watchful and all-knowing superconsciousness, and\nreminds the soul of its perfection and oneness with the Father. Spiritual affir-\nmations are statements of truth; all conditions of ''dis-ease'' are but creations\nof the outer human self, and a forgetting of true sonship. When these miscre-\nations of the conscious mind and its imitator, the subconscious, are deprived\nof the sustenance given them through thought and attention, they simply cease\nto exist. When atrue balance and rhythm are established, God's light shines\nundimmed in the body temple.\n\nThrow off sickening thoughts of failure with the tonic of success con-\nsciousness. Smooth away rough inharmony with the chisel of harmony.\n\n"}

But never repeat them without having your full\nattention upon them. Absorb the full meaning of each word; then float the af-\nfirmation into the ether, charged with deep realization and feeling. In your\n\nके - absolute faith in, and acknowledgement of God, you open-the channel for His\nhealing power to flow through you.\n\nIn line with vibratory healing, of which the use of affirmations is one phase,\nit should be remembered that sound of any kind has its effects upon the human\nnervous system. As inharmonious sounds irritate the nerves, so harmonious\nyet stimulating sounds awaken the drooping tissues of the nervous system by\narousing vital energy inthem. Hence, a gentle, kind word, an inspired song,\n\na soul-solacing voice of wisdom, have deeper, more far-reaching effects than\nare ordinarily recognized. Many a sorrow has been dispelled, and many a pain\nlessened by them. Scientifically understood and applied, vibratory healing\nthrough chanting and affirmation has the effect of sending a volley of energy\ndown through the nervous system, healing diseased tissues of the body, mind,\nand soul. This is attunement, or at-one-ment, with the superconsciousness.\nChanting may thus be used both in self-healing and in healing others.\n\nBriefly, the power of healing depends upon the awakening of soul-force.\n\nThe receptivity of the person and the power of the healer must be evenly bal-\nanced. It is always the arousing of the life force within a person that produces\nhealing. A rebellious body and a mind enslaved by wrong mental habits have\nto be dealt with by mental suggestion, reason, and by exciting the imagination\nof the patient, until the sick person is roused from this mental stupor, and the\n\nr life force is stimulated. In order to heal others, you must first have realiza-\ntion yourself. Then you are one with Infinite Spirit; your knowledge is omni-\npresent.\n\n"}

Wisdom-guided will is\nGod's will. A true spiritual healer knows this, and therefore his vision is not\nbeclouded by doubt and fear, as might be that of one whose emotions allowed\nfear of failure to creep in and undermine the healing power. - In healing others,\nboth will and feeling must be roused to a high degree--the will and feeling of —\nknowing God's omnipresent healing power.

The projection of\nit is similar to throwing a searchlight into the hearts of others, and in this\nway gaining a true diagnosis of their troubles. Atrue diagnosis is extremely\nnecessary in healing, for the source of the dis-ease must be healed. Merely\nto allay pain, without eliminating the cause of it, would be to allow the disease\nto increase without warning, because pain is the \"trouble signal, \"' not the\ntrouble itself.

In sun bathing, always give attention to,\nand concentrate. deeply upon, the sun's rays. This will give far greater results\nthan the same thing done absent-mindedly.\n\nIf one constantly keeps his mind concentrated upon the point between the\neyebrows (at the Christ Consciousness center), and sees there the spiritual\neye, and commands it to recharge the body with strength, it will do so.\n\nThe secret is to do these things regularly and not to give up when results\nare not obtained at once. It usually takes time to change the vibratory action\nof the body and to develop receptivity of mind and body to the vibratory healing\npower of God.\n\nLESSON NO, 69 Rejuvenation is a process of renewing, of continually\n\nmaking new, or retaining a state of perfection, instead\nof allowing disintegration to take place. It may be said that to retain a state\nof changelessness, constant change is necessary; but the rebuilding and break-\ning down process must be evenly balanced. If the breaking down process ex~\nceeds that of the renewing, then bodily old age results.\n\nThe physical requirements for rejuvenation of the body are: keeping it\nsupplied with the sixteen elements of the food chemicals that it needs, plus\nsunshine and regular proper breathing. _ ॥]]& ---- --\n\nPractice the following breathing exercise every day: While walking,\ninhale, counting 1 to 12. Hold the breath 12 counts, then exhale while\ncounting 1 to 12. Do that up to twenty-four times whenever you take\na walk.\n\nFrom the mental standpoint, man should understand how his intelligence\ncontrols and directs the intelligence of the atoms of his body. When he real-\nizes that his intelligence is a ray of Divine Intelligence, he will know that his\nbody is sustained principally by God's cosmic energy, and that he must purify\nhis body and his mind so that this clear light of Directing Intelligence may\nshine through.\n\nThe mind should never have suggested to it, nor should it accept, human\nthoughts of limitation. It should be kept vitalized and nourished by contact\nwith spiritually progressive minds. Exercise with the instruments of judg-\nment, introspection, and initiative. Feast on the creative thinking of yourself\nand others. Cauterize the disease of ignorance by intensive spiritual study.\n\nIt sums up to this: The state of consciousness is the supreme factor in\nrejuvenation. The \"stepping up'' of the consciousness brings about a ''stepping\nup\" of the physical body to such an extent that the soul may become freed of\nits limitations of body consciousness.

He will realize that he is not isolated from Spirit, but\nthat his body is a number of rising, falling waves of vibrating currents in the\nocean of Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nLESSON NO. 70 The first step in rejuvenation is relaxation, both physi-\n\ncal and mental. If you are tensed even slightly in any\npart, you are burning up energy in that part. The burning of energy results in\na breaking down of bodily tissues and in decay. The waste products are thrown\ninto the venous blood. This necessitates the blood's being pumped through the\nheart and lungs for purification. When the muscles and inner organs are freed\nfrom motion by relaxation, this process is slowed down.\n\nSuper-relaxation, which is complete voluntary withdrawal of conscious- .\nness and energy from the entire body, leads to the release of the enormous\nquantity of life current that otherwise would have been needed in the task of\npumping tons of blood through the system. The neutralized, electrified tissues\ndo not require blood and oxygen. Thus the billions of cells rest and learn to\ndepend upon this released inner sustaining current, and the life energy (Word\nof God), coming down from the medulla oblongata. Thus it may be seen why\nthe art of relaxation is of paramount importance, and why the learning of and\npractice of the techniques are continually stressed in these Lessons.\n\nContact of food and oxygen with the inner bodily system is necessary if the\nlife force is to convert the food and oxygen into energy. The life force can\nassimilate oxygen more quickly than it can assimilate solids or liquids. Even\na person who is fasting can recharge his body with electrons and free energy\nfrom the air and ether by practicing certain breathing exercises.\n\nPractice daily the one to six counting exercise. Study the other breathing\nexercises in this Lesson and practice them frequently, especially when in need\n: 7 energy quickly.

Spirit is that vast stillness which is behind everything.\nAs long as there is motion or tension anywhere in the body, there is body\nconsciousness--you are not relaxed. Reverse the searchlight of your atten-\ntion to Spirit. When all the outer activity of body and mind is completely\nstilled, then you know that you are not only the little wave of the soul, but\nthe ocean of Spirit as well.\n\nCarry this realization with you into activity. You should never be either\nphysically or mentally 1829, but always keep busy doing God's work. Lazi--~ ~~\nness is stagnation. The mind should be ever awake in God, even during the\nsleep of the body. This is being superconsciously active, as you should be\nevery moment of your existence.\n\nPractice the exercises as given inthis Lesson. Before meditation, tense\nthe whole body and then let go quickly, to untie all the little knots of energy in\nthe body. These exercises are for the purpose of removing identification of\nlife force and energy from the muscles and withdrawing it to the spine.\nThrough faithful practice, the path of Self-realization will open up for you.\n\nLESSON NO. 73 It is possible to develop \"ears that hear\" and \"eyes that\n\nsee.'' The world is actually so different from what one\nordinarily sees. The only sounds one hears are those within the range of his\nvibrational attunement. Clairaudience is sometimes called intuitive hearing,\nfor sounds may be heard that are not ordinarily heard by the ear.\n\nIn reality all the power of seeing lies inthe soul. The power of all our\nsenses may be stimulated by the power of the mind. It is not the eye that\nsees; energy and mind \"photograph\" things. Our eyes are as powerful as X\nrays, but we do not see the things that an X ray photographs because we have\nnot developed a response to that rate of vibration. Our sensory perceptions\nare curtailed owing to self-imposed limitations of our mental processes.\n\nClairvoyance occurs when the life force has been sensitized to certain\n\n"}

When it beholds itself as a re-\nflection of Spirit, it is called ''soul.'' The ego is the false consciousness the\nsoul acquires when it becomes entangled with sense perceptions. The egoic\nconsciousness is active in the conscious and subconscious states, and extends\nat the utmost to semi-superconsciousness. Beyond that is the perception of । |\nthe soul. |\n\nIn all types of dreams the energy is relaxed from sensory and muscular\nactivity and is accumulated in the brain.\n\nIntuition and superconsciousness are the same.

They may be visions of the future or.\neven certain experiences of past lives. A real vision is induced consciously\n--consciously you reach the state of superconsciousness, and then produce a\nvision; but a semiconscious dream is produced while sleeping.\n\nAll hallucinations, which are detrimental to visions and higher spiritual\nattainment, come from the subconscious mind.

This\ninner mental environment of thought and mental habits almost automatically\nguides our actions. That is why mental habits, if not good, have to be cau-\nterized at their source; otherwise they keep coming to the surface of con-\nsciousness at unexpected times, just when you think you have them conquered.\nTheir roots have to be burned in the fires of meditation and new seeds of real-\nization planted in their place.\n\nWhen by self-control during meditatim the devotee astrally disconnects\nthe life force from the sensory nerves, it begins to flow inward and becomes\nfocused at the point between the eyebrows as an opalescent light. This in-\nward astral flow and the inner light are the offerings of human wisdom to the\nsoul, ego, and intuition.

Somnambulism is subcon-\nscious control of the conscious process, using of the muscles and limbs to\nact out a subconscious film.

It does not consist in believing a thing,\nbut in knowing it directly and unmistakably. It does not contradict. It is\nalways supported by a right sense of perception, reason, and inference,\nalthough it does not depend upon any data whatsoever offered by the senses or\nthe mind. A real intuition can never be wrong.\n\nEveryone possesses this quality more or less. Like any other faculty,\nit must be cultivated. To rely upon an undeveloped intuitional faculty is dan-\ngerous. Distorted, skeptical reason and emotional feeling overcloud intuition.\nIf the sense and mind windows are befogged with ignorance and sensual and\nmental weaknesses, human understanding becomes clouded.

Therefore, if\nthe data given by the senses is incorrect, the inference is incorrect.\n\nIntuition may be classed as:\n(1) crude,\n\n(2) semideveloped through frequent but unconscious exercise,\n(3) consciously developed through use and meditation.\n"}

We pray to Thee not\nas beggars but as Thine offspring, co-heirs to Thy kingdom. Lovingly\nwe demand our immortal heritage: wisdom, health, happiness, salva-\ntion, eternal joy.\n\nNaughty or good, we are Thy children. Inspire us to seek and find\nThine infallible guidance within us. May we attune our human will (that\nThou gavest us to use freely) with Thy divine will.\n\nSUCCESS THROUGH WILL POWER\n\nThe purpose of human life consists in finding out what we really are. We can\ninquire what human life is because we are endowed with the faculty of reason.\nThe distinctive difference between man and animal is that man has the ability to\nreason and inquire into the source and meaning of his existence, and of the exis-\ntence of other forms of life. Yet many human beings behave more blindly than\nanimals, going sheeplike to the slaughterhouse of death without ever having sought\nthe answer to the mystery of life. Whence did reason come? What is its source?\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN In the zoological garden of life roam all kinds of\n\n\"WISH\" AND ''WILL\" animals of desires. But remember this: to have a\ndesire fulfilled, you must first have the power to\nfulfill it. A wish is a desire that you think cannot ''come true. '' Stronger than\n\n\"wish'' is 'intention--intention to do a thing or to satisfy some wish or desire.\nBut ''will'' means a motivating desire plus application of energy to bring that\ndesire to fruition. It means continuous, concentrated action until that desire is\nfulfilled. How few persons actually \"will\"! Of course one should not use will\npower to perform wrong actions: that is a violation of the purpose of will within\nus, and brings us harm. Man's will should be guided by wisdom. Right desires,\nand will guided by wisdom,lead man to ultimate fulfillment in God.\n\na. wish and to will are different things. We see that people are following\n\nmany different paths to one common goal; all are seeking happiness. Some want\nmoney, some want health, others want fame, hoping that through these they will\nfind happiness. Varied are the desires, but few persons have the will power to\naccomplish them. And how desires come and go inthe mind! Do you realize how\nmany of them have found a place in your heart? Within every man lies a great\ngraveyard of unfulfilled desires. Desires that you feel cannot be fulfilled corrode\nthe heart, and are really just ''wishes.'' Sometimes you hear someone say \"'I\nwish I were a king, '' or something equally unlikely. These are wishes that you\nknow may not be fulfilled. Not all people have the same desires; what may inter-\nest one doesn't necessarily have any attraction for someone else.\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 639, "text": "S-4 P-79 3\n\nMany people think they should not use their own will power to accomplish\nwhat they desire, lest they \"interfere\" with the scheme of life in some way. But\nin order not to use will power one would have to lie down and not move at all. If\nyou move even a finger, you are using your will power. You must use will power\neven to eat. The only time your will power is inactive is when you are under\nchloroform or are otherwise rendered unconscious. When the power to will\nleaves the body entirely, man dies.\n\nWHY DO PEOPLE Do you know why people fail? It is because they give up.\nFAIL IN LIFE? I often say that if I had no job, I would shake up the whole\nworld so that it would be glad to give me a job to keep me\nquiet. You must exercise your will power. If you make up your mind and go\nforth like a flame, every obstacle in your path will be consumed. The man of\nrealization walks safely even where bullets fly, for the divine will is behind him.\n\nRouse this will power from the sleep of ignorance, How can you develop it?\nChoose some objective that you think you cannot accomplish, and then try with\nall your might to do that one thing. When you have achieved success, go on to\nsomething bigger and keep on exercising your will power in this way. If your\ndifficulty is great, deeply pray: ''Lord, give me the power to conquer all my dif-\nficulties. '' You must use your will power, no matter what you are, or who you\nare, You must make up your mind. Use this will power both in business and in\nmeditation.\n\nSuch will power lies within youthat if you really put it to use there is nothing\nyou could not accomplish. Will power has created everything--even your body.\nIt is the will that leads you from one desire to another until with all your might\nyou try to succeed in accomplishing your greatest desires. Rarely do people\ndevelop the true potentiality of will power! The will develops in man by normal\nevolutionary progress, but its evolution may be hastened by right thinking and\nacting.\n\nCarrying a thought with dynamic will power means holding to it until that\nthought pattern develops dynamic force. When a thought is made dynamic by will\nforce, it can create or rearrange the atoms into the desired pattern according to\nSad mental blueprint you have created. When youcontinuously develop your will\nuntil its dynamic force manifests, you can heal others by your will power; you can\nsay, as Jesus said tothe leper, \"व will; be thou clean'' (Matthew 8:3). You can\ncontrol your destiny by will power; you can command a mountain, ''Be thou\nremoved, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done\" (Matthew 21:21).\n\nHuman will guided by ignorance leads to error and unhappiness; but when\nhuman will is guided by wisdom to right actions, and thus tuned in with divine will,\nit then operates for man's highest welfare and happiness. That is what Jesus\nmeant when he said: ''Thy will be done. '' God wishes us to tune in with divine\nwill, that we may be guided by His wisdom to find the real fulfillment of all our\ndesires, in Him.\n\n"}

But it is necessary to exercise will power, to strive to tune\n\nit with the divine will. When your will revolves continually around one definite\npurpose, it becomes dynamic will. This is the quality of will power possessed\n\nby Jesus and by all other great sons of God.\n\nThe power behind your will is the will of God. This is the way to develop\nyour will:\n\n1. Before you will to do a thing, reason as to what you should do.\n2. Make sure that you are directing your will toward accomplishing\nsomething good and helpful to yourself.\n\nDon't be passive. Your will was given to you so that you may use it and\nbecome a conqueror. Remember, in your will is the will of God. It is His power\nthat you use. Therefore in your heart you must love nothing more than God, who\nisa \"jealous\" God. If you want God, you must have the will to cast away from\nyour heart every desire but the desire for Him. And if you really want God,\nnothing wrong can touch you. Have only one desire: ''May Thy love shine forever\non the sanctuary of my devotion, and may I be able to awaken Thy love in all\nhearts.'' That is my only prayer. I don't even pray for my body. Idon't want\nto enjoy God alone; I want to establish the consciousness of God in the hearts of\nall men. So always remember that the greatest and highest use of will is to will\nfor God alone. God is imperishable and with God everything good will come.\nDevelop your will power. Turn your will power away from worldly desires; it is\nwasted on them. Look at this life as nothing but a dream. Make up your mind to\nwill for God.\n\nIf you know that you have got to find God in order to satisfy soul-hunger\nwithin; and if you use your will power, then you will find Him. But God will not\nanswer unless you know the law. Again and again you must fire the shells of your\nprayer and will power to break down the ramparts of God's silence. He is castled\nin silence, but if you send shell after shell of concentration and meditation, the\nwalls will break and God's glory will burst forth.\n\n4 POWER TIES LIFE There is enough life-energy current in your body\nAND CONSCIOUSNESS to last you several thousand years. Yet as soon\nTO THE BODY as something happens to the body, you discard all\n\nthoughts of energy. Currents of life energy of\ntremendous voltage play around and within you, but because you spend a little of\nit through your muscles, you say: 'Iamtired. My back feels as if it were\n\nbroken. '' The moment you say ''tired, '' the mind gives up! You should eliminate\nthis word from your vocabulary. |\n\nIf you lose your will power and ambition, you are as good as dead already.\nThat is why you should never lose interest in life. If you tamper with will power | ।\nby utilizing it wrongly, you lose your connection with the cosmic energy; but if\nyou exercise that will power, you contact that tremendous life force. We must\n\n"}

You know what happens to persons near death when\ntheir will falters. They become so tortured by pain that they say: \"All right, let\nme go, I cannot stand any more.'' And they give up. If you never let your will\n80, you would never die, for it is will power that ties the life and consciousness\nto the body. There is nothing more powerful than will. Everything in this uni-\nverse is produced by will. :\n\nPhysiological changes may even be made to occur in the body by will power.\nThere is no time element involved; place a thought in the mind and hold it the re,\nand think that the thing is done and your whole body and mind will respond to it.\n\nNor does it take time to acquire or discard a habit if you exercise sufficient\nwill power.

Such a will becomes one with the Divine\n\nWill.\nek न\n\nTHOUGHTS TO LIVE BY\n\nAn unceasing demand for anything, mentally whispered with unflagging zeal\nand unflinching courage and faith, develops into a dynamic power that so influ-\nences the entire behavior of the conscious, subconscious, and superconscious\npowers of man that the desired object is gained. The inner performance of men-\ntal whispers must be unceasing, undaunted by reverses. Then the desired-for\nobject will materialize. The highest desire is to seek the contact of the all-\nsatisfying, all-desire-quenching Bliss of God.\n\nEK नर\nTHE \"MEEK\" MAN AND THE BANDIT\n\nOne day when I was seated in meditation in a public park a rough-looking man\n\ncame up to me and said, ''Give me ten cents.'' I gave him the money without any\nprotest. He started to walk away, but quickly turned round and came a few steps\nnearer. ''Give me another ten cents, '' he said, and 1 again obliged. 1 could see\n\nhe was thinking he had met the meekest man on earth, and that he would press his\nluck further. \"Give me twenty-five cents,'' he demanded, and kept on increasing\n\n"}

And once you are dead it is\nall over and you cannot remember; so why worry?\n\nIf someone is trying to get you in trouble, affirm continuously, ''lam peace,\nIam calm,\" and say it deeply.

Sometimes it is necessary to make others understand that you mean\nbusiness; but you are a child of God and you should never be angry. The more\noften you lose your temper, the longer you will remain in the delusory mortal\nconsciousness; but if you remain inwardly calm, you are demonstrating the poise\nof a true child of God.\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nNothing shall blight my smiles.

You\nare blessed children of God, sent on earth to demonstrate the perfection of\nyour Father, but instead you go from this earth shattered and scarred. Jesus\ntold you the truth when he said that you are made in the image of God. What is\nit then that you are now displaying? Is it an image that has been desecrated\nby the hand of ignorance?\n\nWe are immortal, perfect children of God, sent on earth by our Father.\nBut because we misuse our independence, we suffer from disease and sorrows.\nRemember, no matter what you want, if you seek it from this illusive world\nyou will never find it. Hence life is an amazing paradox, because we are try-\ning to find fulfillment of our dreams through our lives here. We were sent\nhere as immortals, but instead we have started begging, forgetting our divine\nheritage within.\n\nThe sunlight shines equally on the charcoal and the diamond, but only the\ndiamond reflects its light. So, although God's light shines equally on every-\nthing and in everyone, ‘'diamond'' souls, by their own creative quality, receive\nand reflect the light of God; ''charcoal\"' souls, whose divine intelligence is\nbeclouded by worldly delusion, do not allow God's brilliance to pass through\nthem. Although God made us in His image, it still rests with us whether we\nveil that image with ignorance or let it shine forth freely. The great point is\nthat although God made us all--the yellow, white, black, and olive-colored--\nin His image, some do nevertheless receive and reflect His rays more than\nothers. The great ones who have expressed the light of God are the diamonds\namong souls.

It is very difficult for the occult soldiers of spirituality to help\nreclaim the kingdom of peace after it has fallen into the hands of restlessness\nand material desire.\n\nJoy born of meditation is the indication that God has replied to the devotion\nand concentration-tuned radio of your mind in response to your unceasing prayer\nbroadcastings. You should pray until you receive the divine answer. Many\n\n"}

Thus your message will reach God. But do not stop\nthere. Goon affirming: \"I and my Father are One,\" until His joy fills your\nheart and mind. When you let God control you, He awakens you from the night -\nmare fears and sorrows of mortal delusion, and causes His ocean of wisdom\n\nto flow through the little channel of your mind, expanding it with His omni-\npresence and immortality.\n\nTo grow the flower of God-peace and divine inner accomplishment through\ndaily meditation is more enjoyable and lasting than all the wealth of the universe.\nThere is nothing more joyous than God's presence. Once recognized, it is an\neternal possession. Wealth can only be used; it cannot be held forever. But\n= bliss discovered in meditation is ever new, undying. Meditation is the\nmissing link between religion and realization.\n\nEFFORT AND ENERGY Most people who fail and are not prosperous have\nDEVELOP TALENTS come to this pass because they hypnotized them-\n\nselves with the consciousness of their failures, and\nthey did not make repeated, steady efforts to succeed. Creative mental effort\nshould also accompany repeated efforts of will and activity. That is, energy\nand effort should not.be wasted_on a wrong venture, but instead should be.\nexpended on the right business suited to you; what is right for you has to be\nfound out or created by your thinking, penetrating Self. The world is full of\nimitators; there are few creative workers. The one who creates does not wait\nfor an opportunity, blaming circumstances, the fates, andthe gods. He seizes\nopportunities or creates them with the magic wand of his will, effort and search-\ning discrimination. It is not the person who is overeager for success who suc-\nceeds. Many want success, a few strive for it, and a very few perseveringly\nand wisely act to find it. Mental laziness, lack of initiative, and lack of per-\nseverance are the greatest enemies of success. The poor wish they had money;\nand the rich, who feel completely safe in their prosperity, may die poor.\n\nMost people spend all their lives desiring to do something perfectly, such\nas playing the piano or painting, but are too lazy and careless to put forth the\neffort required to reach perfection in the chosen activity. They go on for years\nperforming inefficiently and excusing themselves by saying: \"7 had no time to\npractice or to find a good teacher; anyway, I'm not a genius.'' They fail to\nrealize that extraordinary talent is not as necessary as unswerving purpose\nand unfailing application and effort according to a given spiritwl law. Most [760 -\nple fail in attaining their material, mental, and spiritual desires because of\ntheir lack of definite purpose and sustained effort.\n\nFear destroys business initiative. It paralyzes the desire to repeat success-\nproducing efforts. Fear eclipses the almighty power of the soul. Fear nothing\nelse, but try to fear fear. A mental indulgence in fear will create a subconscious\n\n"}

When you\nbring in your own ego, you hide God within you. So avoid having either an inferi-\nority or a superiority complex; they both retard the progress of the soul. You | ।\nshould feel that God is with you, guiding you, and that God is your greatest love\nand your greatest superior. When you are one with Him you regard yourself\nas the servant of all; therefore you cannot think of yourself as superior. And\nbecause He is within you, it would be untrue to God in you to think of yourself\nas inferior.\n\nAn inferiority complex is born of mixing with weak-minded persons, and\nfrom having an innately weak subconscious mind. A superiority complex is\nborn of false pride and the upstart ego. Both complexes are destructive to Self-\ndevelopment. Both live on imagination and ignore the realm of real facts.\nNeither disqualification belongs to the true, all-powerful nature of soul. Devel-\nop self-confidence by conquering your weaknesses.

Listen to the comfortin\nand inspiring words of the great minds of all ages. Read books after meditation\nCriticize books with intuitive perception. Keep your mind busy most of your\nleisure time with good books unless you are meditating. Good books will keep\nyour mind safe from the company of so-called friends and from idle thoughts\nthat create boredom and dissatisfaction.\n\nRead, mark, and inwardly digest selected passages from great books. Dis-\ncuss important topics with intelligent people. Thinking over logically a given\nidea is the best way to develop originality in your ideas. When thinking, keep\nyour eyes closed and your mind wholly concentrated on the subject of your study.\nDo nothing with only half attention or halfheartedly. Read spiritual books that\ncontain the thought-fruits of others! Self-realization. Such books as the Bhaga-\nvad-Gita (the Hindu Bible) and the Christian Bible should not be read as you\nwould read a novel. Read a passage, think about its meaning, then meditate\nupon its truth. Then try to live that truth. There are two kinds of learned men.\nOne is a ''moving library, '' always collecting books on the shelf of memory. The\nother is always busy expanding his powers of introspection, assimilating ideas.\nYou should never read without assimilation.

Truth is the consciousness that is guided by spiritual wisdom to perform\ncertain actions--not because everybody else says so but because they are right.\nTruth is eternal, yet ever new. It cannot be monopolized by anyone. It will keep\non expressing eternally through the soul of man. Every human being has a right\nand a duty to express it in his or her own life.\n\nSin cannot be thrown away, like dynamite, to explode itself; its temptations\nhave to be stilled by the power of your soul within. If you try to hurt others, you\nwill only succeed in hurting yourself. You should not feel any resentment; do not\nbe mean in anything. Certain sinners may be preferable to certain so-called good\npeople. To be spiritual is to be broad, to understand, to forgive; and if you make\npeople feel that you are their friend, ever ready to help them, you can count on\nthe power of that attitude for good results.\n\nThe man or woman sliding down the path of evil finds no resistance; but as\nsoon as he or she tries to oppose evil habits by following spiritual laws of dis-\ncipline, countless instincts of temptations are roused to fight and foil these\n\nnoble efforts:\n\nKeep busy cleansing your soul of the original temptation inherited from Adam\nand Eve.

May they\nmanifest Thy healing power, just giving to Thee all credit and glory.\n\nKKK\nHOW TO REJUVENATE YOURSELF\n\nProper foods in the right combinations are necessary for the sustenance\nof the body; they exert also a definite influence upon the mind. The sattvic or\nspiritual quality, the rajasic or active quality, and the tamasic or material\nquality of the mind are all affected by the food we eat. The activating rajasic\nquality may dominate or combine with the other two qualities to form differ-\nent mental tendencies in man: spiritually active, intellectually active, or\n\nmaterially active.\n\nEverything we eat produces a sensation on the palate, as well as certain\nchemical effects on the body and brain. The sensations created by the food\ndetermine a specific mentality. Meat eating produces gross material reac-\ntions that develop the material or animal mental tendencies, whereas eating\n\nraw fruits and vegetables helps to reinforce and develop the spiritual qualities.\n\nThe quality of the food's taste and color is reported to the brain through\nthe nerves of taste and sight, and is experienced as specific pleasant or un-\npleasant sensations. These are elaborated by the mind into perceptions and\nconceptions. Dwelling mentally on certain conceptions about foods forms\ndefinite mental habits that manifest as material, active, or spiritual qualities\nof thought and behavior.\n\nFASTING AND SPECIAL DIETS\n\nThe ancient yogis claimed that most diseases can be cured by judicious\nfasting. The following diets and fasts, undertaken under proper medical\nsupervision, will be found helpful.\n\nFasting may be complete or partial. Partial fasting falls into the follow-\ning four broad subdivisions:\n\n1) Limiting the diet to certain foods.\n\n2) Abstaining from certain foods.\n\n3) Limiting the food intake as to quantity.\n\n4) Limiting the number of meals to one or two per day.\n\nSome of these forms of fasting may be combined. For instance, to cure\ndisease or reduce weight, a person may abstain from certain foods altogether,\nand limit the intake of other foods, and so on.\n\n@\n\n"}

He was often visited by a wealthy worldly man who showed\ngreat devotion outwardly. But this rich man--who had at one time been a great\nsinner, but who had apparently reformed--kept company with this great saint\nmostly for the purpose of covering up his old traits and to make it appear that\nhe was becoming religious.\n\nBy way of pretending his great devotion to the saint, this hypocritical\nworldly man asked to take spiritual instruction from him. Accompanied by\nhis wife and two servants, he came to request sacred initiation.\n\nThe saint greeted the rich man and then said: ''First of all, I want you\nand your companions to know that I make disciples only of those who pass my\nspiritual tests. \"'\n\nTne rich man and the two servants spoke up at once: \"Of course! We\n\n-shall-be-glad te-go through your tests; we are sure we can-passthem.'._But-—.\n\nthe humble wife meekly said: ''Only if God blesses my efforts to go through\n\nyour tests may I be successful. \"'\n\nThe saint then left them and went to his banana grove. Soon he returned\nwith eight bananas. He handed two bananas to each of the four persons--the\nhusband, the wife, and the two servants. Thenthe saint said: \"Will you\nplease, each of you, go out singly to the loneliest spot that you can find and\nsecretly eat the fruit; then come back tome. Remember, if you aspire to\npass my test, you must not be seen at all while you are eating the bananas,\nand you must surely return by evening. ''\n\nThe husband confidently sequestered himself in a dark, windowless closet\nin a friend's house. There he brought forth the fruit, which he had hidden in\nhis pocket, and hastily ate them. He returned quickly to the saint and said:\n‘Honored Sir, it is done. ''\n\nRamaka only smiled as he commented: \"It is strange that within sucha\nshort time you could find a really lonely place free from the presence of any-\n\n'\n\n076. '\n\nThe two servants, after a long search, finally went deep into a forest.\nEntering different caves, they ate their fruit and returned to the saint.

''\n\nAt last, when evening came, the humble wife of the rich man returned.\nShe was tired out and depressed. Placing the two bananas in front of the saint,\nshe spoke: ‘Honored sage, Iam sorry to admit that I cannot pass your test.\nAll day long I have tried to find a secret place--in closed rooms, and in man-\nforsaken wild gardens of nature, in deep valleys, forests, ravines, dark\nmountain caves, and inthe secret temple of my mind. But I could not find any\nsuch place where I could eat the bananas. When I went into the vast fields, I\nsaw a Silent Being nodding in the blades of grass. Itried the garden of wild\nflowers, and there I saw Somebody smiling at me through the opened lips of\npetals, mocking at my fruitless attempt to find a lonely place. Itried the\nvalleys and ravines, and Somebody's tall stony mountain neck quivered, and\nI knew I was being watched.\n\n\"Then, desperate, I tried the mountain caves. But as I started to eat the\nbananas, I felt an Invisible Presence. I seemed to hear laughter and Someone\nsaying: ‘Look, Iam the light that shineth even in the midst of utmost darkness | ।\nand in the gloom of mountain breasts.' Il ignored the laughing Voice, and yet,\nas I tried to eat the fruit, the darkness shivered and threw a streak of light\non it.\n\n\"I closed my eyes and made up my mind to eat the bananas without paying\nany attention to the light that fell onthem. Suddenly I saw all my thoughts\nawakened in the dark temple of my mind, and they rebuked me, seeming to\nsay: 'You can't eat the bananas alone. We are all watching you, and our Su-\npreme Father, who gave us our birth, is ever within us, invisible yet tangibly\nwatching you lest you be deluded into thinking that you can find a spot where\nHe does not live and which is free from His all-pervading gaze.' 80 1 gave up,\nand now, Holy Sire, I am at your feet.

Train all my senses to enjoy only that which\nreminds me of Thee.\n\nEK\nHOW TO REJUVENATE YOURSELF (2)\n\nThe following diets and fasts, undertaken under proper medical supervi-\nsion, will be found helpful in the conditions described.\n\nREDUCING DIET:\n\nPractice the Energization Exercises in Lesson 34 six times, twice a day;\nand the stomach exercises (also in Lesson 34) twenty times each. Command\nyour will, while tensing the muscles during exercise, to burn up the super-\nfluous tissues. Practice the running exercise fifty to two-hundred times a\nday. Eat mostly raw vegetables and one boiled yolk of an egg a day. Abstain\nfrom starchy food, fried foods, and sweets. Do not drink water with meals.\nEvery three days fast one day on orange juice.\n\nExtremely stout people can derive much benefit from fasting on orange | ।\njuice seven days and then going on the nine-day cleansing diet, a normal diet\nbeing resumed gradually thereafter. If there should be need for further reduc-\ntion of weight, this procedure may be repeated after an interval of two weeks.\n\nFATTENING DIET:\nThe following foods are of high nutritive value and have been found bene-\n\nficial for those who wish to gain weight. Some of them should be added to the\nusual diet each day.\n\nBananas with cream 2 eggs\n= with cream 1 tablespoon olive oil\n1/4 glass cream 3 1/2 ounces butter\n\n2 slices whole-wheat bread\nWeight has also been gained by eating bananas in abundance, and, for one\nmonth, drinking two glasses of water (moderately hot or cold, not iced) with\n\neach meal.\n\nGENERAL RULES:\n\nTo have faith in God's healing power through the mind, and yet obey dietary @\nlaws, is better than just to have faith in God and mind and disregard dietary\nlaws.

Mix good salad dressings made of thoroughly ground\nnuts, cream, a few drops of lemon juice, orange juice and honey with all\nsalads. Thousand Island dressing is good. A little curry sauce with boiled\neggs or vegetables, once in a while, is a good salivary stimulant.\n\nFOOD COMBINATIONS:\n\nFor best results, one should abstain from all beef and pork products. Do\nnot make a habit of eating even chicken, lamb, or fish. Nuts, cottage cheese,\navocados, eggs, milk, cream, and bananas are very good meat and fish sub-\nstitutes. If you do eat chicken, lamb, or fish have a large vegetable salad\nwith them.\n\nDo not eat too much white sugar. Raw sugar is preferable, and honey is\nre of all. Eat Nature's candies, such as unsulphured figs, prunes, and rai-\nsins. The ingestion of excessive quantities of sweets causes intestinal fermen-\ntation. Remember also that frequent indulgence in fried foods and foods pre-\npared from white flour can be injurious to one's health. Highly refined foods\nsuch as polished rice have been stripped of most of their food value; natural\nfoods are as a rule more healthful. Try to include in your daily diet a large\npercentage of raw fruits and vegetables. If your diet has consisted chiefly of\ncooked foods, let the introduction of raw foods be a gradual one, until your\nsy stem—becomes accustomed-to the change. Cooked vegetables. should be eaten\nwith the juice in which they were steamed.\n\nFast regularly, using your best judgment as to proper diet in accordance\nwith the instructions given above. Eat less; follow dietary rules when you eat.\nMake sunshine, oxygen, and the Energization Exercises a part of your regular\ndaily diet.\n\nDAILY DIET:\n\nYour daily food intake should include as many items as possible from the\nfollowing list of foods that contain all the elements needed for the proper main-\ntenance of the body. If you do not include all the fruits mentioned in a single\nday's diet use larger portions of those you do serve. Serve different fruit on\ndifferent days.\n\n1 apple 3 baked or steamed yellow or green\n1 grapefruit vegetables with juice\n\n1 lemon 1 raw carrot\n\n1 lime 6 leaves of raw spinach\n\n1 orange 1/4 head lettuce\n\n1 glass orange juice (with pulp) 1 teaspoon olive oil\n\n1 tablespoon ground nuts 1 glass milk\n\n1 slice pineapple 1 tablespoon cottage cheese\n\n"}

For instance, you may take the\nmilk at breakfast, bread and egg and vegetable salad at noon, nuts and fruits\nat night.\n\nCatarrh of the alimentary canal often results from overeating at night,\nalso from eating excessively of candy or other foodstuffs which have an\nirritating effect on the mucous membranes of the stomach, duodenum, and so\nforth.\n\nIndividual food habits may be taken into consideration, but if they are\nbad gradually change them. At any rate, add some of the foods in “Daily Diet\"\nlist to what you are used to eating. Omit those foods mentioned above which\ndo not agree with you, eating only very lightly when you feel the need of\nnourishment, and gradually accustoming yourself to a more wholesome diet.\n\nYou may increase or decrease the quantities given in the list in accord-\nance with your individual needs. It is, of course, obvious that the person\ndoing strenuous muscular work requires more food than the sedentary worker.\n\nWhenever one is hungry, he may take a large tablespoonful of thoroughly\nground nuts in half a glass of water or in a glass of orange juice. When\nthirsty, drink a glass of orange juice or water (preferably distilled or\nboiled water if pure water is not available). However, nature's distilled\nwater -- undiluted fruit juice -- is best. Do not drink too much water with\nyour meals. Ice water should be taken very sparingly at any time, but espe-\ncially during and after meals as it lowers the temperature of the stomach and\ndilutes the digestive juices, thus retarding digestion. Never drink ice water\nwhen you are overheated,\n\nMAGNETIC DIET:\n\nAs a rule, the word \"food\" is used only in connection with physical\nnourishment, but there are other kinds of food, namely, mental energy, or\nconcentration, and divine wisdom. The first (material food) recharges the\n= battery; the second (concentration) recharges the mind battery; the third\n(divine wisdom), the soul battery.\n\nHave you ever analyzed your magnetic mental diet? It consists usually\nof the thoughts that you are thinking as well as thoughts you are receiving\nfrom close contact with friends. Peaceful friends always conduce to a healthy\nmagnetic mind. It is easy to tell whether a person feeds on a quarrelsome or\na peaceful environment. Inner disquietude and worries, owing to the wrong\nsort of friends or unappreciative immediate relatives, produce an unwholesone,\ngloomy mind.\n\nThe magnetic diet also consists of such food substitutes as rays and\noxygen, which can be easily assimilated and converted into energy by the\nlatent life forces.

Vitamins are dif-\nferent kinds of rays. When you are eating, you are eating energy. The ultra-\nviolet rays that one absorbs from the sun exert a beneficial vitalizing effect\non the body. The healing of most sores and wounds can be enhanced by exposing\nthem to the sunlight for up to one-half hour daily. The treatment with arti-\nficially produced ultraviolet and infrared rays also supplies the body with\nmagnetic nourishment. Much benefit may be derived from it if it is taken\nunder proper medical supervision. In order to receive electronic energy from\nthe ether, expel the breath, remain calm while sitting in the erect posture,\nand feel the electronic energy surrounding your body and entering through your\nbody cells; or receive energy through your fingers while your hands are lifted\nover your head,\n\nRubbing the whole naked body vigorously and rapidly with the palms be-\nfore taking a bath generates life force and is very beneficial. Bathing in\nsunlight-heated or ultraviolet-ray-saturated water is also very beneficial.\nWhen using a sun lamp on the affected body part, concentrate your entire\nthought upon the feeling of warmth and know that you are absorbing the energy\ninto the atomic composition of the body, and thus electrifying your cell\nbatteries.\n\nTHOUGHTS TO REMEMBER If you are naturally victorious over physical\n__ greed, or if you have acquired self-control by\n\nstrenuous efforts, you have nothing to worry about; but if you find yourself\nbeing carried away little by little, a prisoner of temptation, then you should\ntry to train your armies of self-control. Seek good company. Eat less --\nespecially eat less meat. Fruits and vegetables should make up the greater\n\npart of your diet. Take plenty of exercise. Keep your thoughts busy with the\n\nwonder and peace of God.\n\n**R*\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nI shall behold wisdom in ignorance, joy in sorrow, health\nin weakness, for I know that God's perfection is the only reality.\n\n"}

It is not easy to have a good disposition if you are ill, and\nyou are made ill mostly by eating the wrong food; so study carefully the sub-\nject of food as related to your particular needs.\n\nThe body requires certain elements for its sustenance, but a good many\npeople omit at least some of these elements from their diet every day. That\nis the reason why disease has uncontrolled sway everywhere. God did not\ncreate disease. Mancreates it through continued wrong living. A stucco\ncovering ona house loses some of its constituent ingredients through the de-\nteriorating influence of the weather. So also in the body, cells are constantly\ndecaying, and for that reason the body house needs proper repairing with the\nright kind of food materials for new cell growth and maintenance.\n\nEvery day the tissues should be supplied with the right kind of body-build-\ning materials. In plastering a house, if you mix less than enough lime in the\nsand, or just make a plaster of sand and water and smooth it on your walls, in\na short time the plaster will begin to fall off, although at first you may not |\nhave noticed anything wrong with its appearance. Similarly, our bodies decay\nwhen not \"'plastered'' with the right kind of blood containing the correct kind\nand quantity of body-building elements. The body begins to lose vigor, the\ntissues become flabby, the skin begins to wrinkle, and the cells begin to lose\ntheir building power. So you should be extremely careful to arrange your\nbreakfast, lunch, and dinner in such a way that you can always be sure you\nare giving the body the proper food substances. As it is important to intro-\nduce the right food into the system, it is still more important to develop and\nmaintain the God-given powers of digestion, oxygenation, chemicalization,\nelimination, crystallization, metabolism, and assimilation.\n\nTherefore in connection with food hygiene consider two things:\n\na) selection of proper food materials;\nb) awakening of vital forces by proper exercise.\n\nThe following information is based on the finding of diet authorities and\nthe teachings of the Hindu yogis.\n\n"}

Examples of foods in these groups, and the foods that offer specific\nnutritive values, are given below:\n\nPROTEINS consist of highly complex combinations of amino acids contain-\ning chiefly carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur. Protein may be\nanimal or vegetable, and is needed in the construction of all living cells.\nSources of animal protein are meat, fish, milk, cheese, and eggs. Vegetable\nproteins are found in protein flour, legumes, and nuts.\n\nIf you are used to eating meat, fish, and poultry as your chief protein\nsource, aim for little or no meat inthe diet. If you believe your system de-\nmands = have lamb, chicken, or fish, occasionally. The high protein value\nof these foods is offset by their deteriorating effect on the body; hence it is bet-\nter to depend on other sources such as cheese, eggs, milk, etc., for this vital-\nly necessary food element.\n\nFATS are energy producing and consist of oily matter found in vegetable\nand animal foods. These lubricate the cells and are extremely necessary for\noiling the joints and limbs to prevent wear and uncomfortable friction. Vege-\ntable fats are found in olive oil, corn oil, nuts (nut oils), legumes (peanut and\n\n`. ---5 $ bean oils}; and aveeados; animal fats are found in butter, cream, lard, and\n\nfatty meats.\n\nCARBOHYDRATES are used as fuel, and consist of compounds of carbon,\nhydrogen, and oxygen, including sugar, starch, and cellulose. They are found\nin grain products, potatoes, legumes (peas and beans), corn, winter squash,\ntapioca, honey, sugar, sweet fruits.\n\nWATER 18 the carrier which transports food elements to the cells and car-\nries away waste products.\n\nMINERAL SALTS have great tissue-building powers. They are found in\nall fruits and vegetables, especially leafy vegetables.\n\nVITAMINS regulate various metabolic processes and are essential to the\nnutrition of vertebrates. Vitamins are abundantly present in all raw fruit and\nvegetables. In this form all the valuable properties of the vitamins enter right\ninto your blood without being lost.

There is only one truth, though its aspects are\nmyriad; there cannot be two or more conflicting truths. ''Mine is the only\ntrue religion, the best, '' is the declaration of many persons. But there should\nbe a standard for judging what is best, just as the standard of quality of the\ngoods determines which store is the best in town, even though all claim that\ndistinction.\n\nThe good that formal religion has done through the ages, by reminding\npeople of an ideal, can never be denied. Yet unscientific religion that holds\n2 only through dogmatic reasoning, or fear, or emotion, has caused the\ntyranny of the caste system, for example, in the East; and of the class sys-\ntem, Spanish Inquisition, and the burning of martyrs in the West.\n\nHOW TO AVOID Like slaves of yore, religion is shackled and impris-\nBIGOTRY oned in the dark house of dogma. A great war on ig-\nIN RELIGION norance should be launched in order to free the bond-\n\nslave religion from the hands of superstition. Prime-\nval religion was born in the womb of man's unscientific seeking for the origin\nof the mysteries of his being, of future life, of nature's violent phenomena,\nof God. A few real prophets with intuitive wisdom have risen during the ages,\nexhorting people to believe in their doctrines, but science failed to support\ntheir doctrines by actual investigation.\n\nReligious bigotry based on untested beliefs, and differences between the\nraces have kept Orientals and Occidentals, brother and brother, divided. We\noften concentrate upon ridiculing each other, and that is why we do not see the\nbetter qualities in each other. Ignorance is shared fifty-fifty between the East\nand the West. When ignorant people of the East and the West meet, they often\nquarrel and disagree, owing to their blind self-laudation. But when wise peo-\nple of the East and the West meet, they agree that neither is everything per-\nfect nor everything bad in their respective hemispheres. To develop a perfect\n\n7 oo ~\n\n"}

The reason that dogmatic\nreligion is not universally practiced either at school or at home is because it\nis not scientific; its principles have not been put to the acid test of universal\nexperience. When clergies become bigoted, religion should be taken out of\ntheir hands and given over to unprejudiced scientists who would try to find the\nbest method of living for developing a race of Christlike men--the real super-\nmen. When dogma is sifted out, we can have a religion that will inspire us not\nonly on Sunday mornings, but be supremely useful to us each day in rejuvenat-\ning the body, strengthening the mind, and recharging the spirit with unlimited\nwisdom and happiness.\n\nPUTTING THE CHURCH The method of some churches has been to hold\nON A FIRM FOUNDATION their members by inbred churchgoing habits,\n\nor by extra lectures and musical or festive\nprograms. Such pleasure is only outward stimulation that can better be sup-\nplied by the theaters and other pleasure agencies whose business itis. A\nchurch cannot compete with professional entertainment; nor can. it long. hold ..\nmembers merely by repeating the same untested statements in sermons, even\nthough they are continuously presented in new, interesting ways, and accom-\npanied by good musical programs.\n\nThe role of the church is to offer a distinct, individual, and characteristic\nform of social service by showing the practical, workable way to peace, en-\nlightenment, and spiritual strength.\n\nInstead of preaching untested dogmas and urging people to believe, the\nchurch should be a university of experimental application of spiritual laws. In\nIndia, in little secluded hermitages unidentified by any religious trademark,\nreal spiritual teachers who live the life are experimenting with the worthwhile\neffects of the application of spiritual laws in the lives of true seekers. They\nare not interested in attracting the curiosity seekers who float from one teach-\ning to another and practice none.\n\nThe churches, instead of arguing with one another about the infallibility\nof their individual dogmas, should get together and find the real meaning of\nlife; through following psychoethical laws they should discover the universal\nstandard of the art of living that can really uplift and help their people, daily,\nin every aspect of life.\n\nChurch funds, instead of being almost wholly tied up in ornamental edifices,\noften with heavy mortgages, could better be employed in inducing the greatest\n"}

'' Since in those days\nthere were no hunting restrictions, he gleefully littered the forest with dead\nand dying birds.\n\nThose birds that managed to elude the gorgon gaze of Nishada's guns be-\ncame so intuitively wise that they could hear even the faintest sound of his\napproach, and escape to safety. When Nishada found that he had so frightened\nthe birds that he could no longer even approach them, he began shooting at\nrandom through the thick jungle foliage. But the wary winged ones kept out of\nrange, and Nishada, his cartridges spent, walked dejectedly on until finally he\nemerged from the jungle. The sight that greeted his vision there stirred fresh\nhope in his breast. An orange-robed saint was standing knee-deep in a nearby\nlake; many kinds of game birds were perched trustfully on his head, shoulders,\nand hands, while others peacefully floated in a circle around him.\n\nAn idea suddenly flashed across the mind of the hunter: \"If I put on an\norange robe every day and pose as a harmless saint, then Ican create enough\ntrust in the birds so that they will perch on me and swarm all around me.\nThen, at my convenience, I can club to death quitea few. In that way I can get\neven with the birds for flying away at the sight of me and depriving me of the\npleasure of killing them. ''\n\nSo Nishada stood motionless behind a tree and watched the saint feed and\nthen sing a sermon to his feathered audience--just as Saint Francis of Assisi\nused todo. Awhile later, after his bath in the lake, this peaceful devotee of\nthe Lord of Love started back to his hermitage, while many bright-winged\ncreatures circled above and called to him.\n\n@\n"}

To his\ngreat glee, the very same game birds who used to fly away at the sight of him\nnow fearlessly perched all over his body and swarmed around him like little\nchildren. He could scarcely believe his eyes.\n\nHe was happy beyond dreams, but every time he made up his mind to\npounce upon the birds and strangle them, he found he couldn't do it. He didn't\nhave the heart to betray the innocent birds who so confidently sought shelter\nwith him.\n\nThen Nishada began to reflect: \"I have been a malicious hunter, feared\nand shunned by the birds, but behold, the magic of the orange robe of a saint,\nalthough it covers a wolf in sheep's clothing, has nevertheless led the birds to\ntrust even my hateful self. If the outer garb of a saint can create so much\ntrust and confidence even in birds, how much wholesome influence and trust a\nreal saint, plus the orange robe, could exert and create in people!\"\n\nThinking this, the hunter threw his clubs, knives, and guns into the water\nand walked away, determined to become a real saint. The faithful birds, who\nfollowed him as long as they could, finally reluctantly departed.\n\n__ _ 1118 hunter saint was known to wade daily in the lake, feeding the birds\nand singing to them.

After making friends\nwith birds, he became a great teacher who attracted all kinds of human friends\nas well. Them he served lovingly and long with the song of truth welling from\n\nthe depths of his heart.\n\nWe have seen that the wicked Nishada, even though he began merely by\ncloaking himself in the garb of goodness, ultimately became good. Do not for-\nget that even though you cannot overcome your inner weakness all at once, it\nis all right for: you to wear the garb of goodness if you are really sincerely\ntrying to be good. It is better to imitate goodness than to imitate wickedness.\nEven a person who only imitates good actions gets a chance to smell the allur-\ning fragrance of goodness; whereas one who even hypocritically imitates evil,\ncontacts the contaminating polecat odor of evil. Of course, to deliberately try\nto deceive people is a great blasphemy against God and yourself; but if you are\nsincerely trying to improve yourself, do not be disturbed if people call youa\nhypocrite just because a few of your failings have len discovered.\n\nWe should not expect too much from anyone, nor should we always expect\nperfect results even from one who consistently does his best.

We know that the reason the scientist gets results is because he\napplies the laws of impartial reasoning, and experiments, by application, with\nthe universal laws of nature.\n\nIt is good that religious groups and individual ministers have become more\nscientific-minded. Churches should live abreast of the times. Their members\nshould apply the psychology of experiment in the laboratory of the church and @\ntest the efficacy of faith and of spiritual laws on human beings. If scientists\ndo not get new knowledge by blind prayer, how can the serious religionist ex-\npect to discover laws of life by blind supplication?\n\nDharma means ''those immutable principles of self-discipline and right\naction that protect man permanently from the threefold suffering of physical\ndisease, mental unhappiness, and spiritual ignorance. '' The discovery and\napplication of these principles, which is the purpose of religion, have not yet\nbeen considered seriously by Western scientists as a subject for lifelong re-\nsearch and practical scientific study. Yet such a study would reveal the ori-\ngin, end, and purpose of human life on earth. In India great yogis have dis-\ncovered through their religious experimentations the practical means of des-\ntroying by the roots the threefold suffering of man--body, mind, and soul--so\nthat there is no possibility of recurrence.\n\nThese same religious experimentations also have given India's yogis\nknowledge since ancient times of scientific truths now being ''discovered\" in\nthe West by pragmatic scientific research. There is a definite need today for\nscientific religious experimentation through the yogic methods of India; with\nall the modern inventions and comforts of present-day Western civilization,\nman's life is still uncertain, unsafe.

Cruel wars have been fought under the guise of religious crusades in the\nname of God.

Even protoplasm is immortal. Everything is indestruc-\ntible, even in the world of matter. Then why this illusion of mortality and\n\ndeath ?\n\nReligious effort should be applied to the conscious conversion of the hu-\nman body into its constituent element, intelligent life energy. Then we will\nknow the meaning of this truth: ''Man shall not live by bread (solids, liquids)\nalone, but by every word (vibratory energy) that proceedeth out of the mouth\nof God (medulla oblongata)'' (Matthew 4:4). It is not food but the energy in\nthe human body that converts food into energy that is the direct source of life.\n\nOn that day when man will know how to dematerialize his body, or convert\nit into its constituent electrons and basic consciousness, and how to material-\nize it again into organized living physical flesh--as Christ did, and as great\nHindu Yogis do-- he will be free.

Do not\ndie in ignorance; die in wisdom--to live forever in God.\n\nThe whole-hearted practice of meditation as taught in these Lessons\nbrings deep Bliss. This ever-new Bliss is not born of desire. It manifests\nitself the moment all restlessness and other undesirable qualities melt away\nby the magic command of your inner, intuition-born calmness. Manifest this\nserenity always. It is not an abstract mental state. When Bliss comes over\nyou, you will recognize it as a conscious, intelligent, universal Being to whom\nyou may appeal.

We are waves\nof human consciousness spumed from the ocean of His consciousness.

Subject to Maya--the law of change--\nhumans are born, live, and die. But when a human wave discovers by Self-\nrealization that he is really the Sea, when he knows that the Sea has become the\nwave of his consciousness, he understands that he may pass through many chang-\ning conditions, but the wave of his consciousness will never be lost or annihilated.\n\nIt is by understanding that life continues after deaththat we can unite our con-\nsciousness with the cosmic consciousness of God and find the cord of one life, one\nlaw, one rhythm, and one wisdom uniting us all.

It is wrong of us to say\n\nthat we are mortals when we are essentially made of immortal stuff. It is\ntruth that we are gods, and it is error to call ourselves weaklings. Only by\nrealizing our oneness with God may we completely break our self-created\nimaginary limitations of accidents, failure, lack, disease, and death. God has\neverything--health, efficiency, wisdom, love, joy--and to be one with Him is\nto have, as His own child, access to everything that He has.\n\nTHE MOST HUMBLE GOD\n\nAges ago, Saint Bhrigu of India had a desire to find out the most humble\nform God had ever taken. He wandered all over the Himalayan mountains\nvisiting its holy places in search of some incarnation of God whom he could\naccept as a guru. But, since he wished to follow an example of humility, he\ndetermined that the god must have this attribute outstandingly. He met many\nsaints, whom he questioned as to where he could find such a guru.\n\nAfter a strenuous search, he found that all the saints whom he met gave\nhim the names of the same three forms of God--Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu,\nwho was then incarnated as Lord Krishna--and assured him that one of them\nwas sure to be the right one.\n\nSaint Bhrigu heard that Brahma could create anything, Shiva could destroy\nanything, and Krishna (Vishnu) could preserve anything from annihilation; for\nthey represented the creative, destructive, and preservative principles active\n\nin all creation.\n"}

He himself had great powers, gained\nthrough meditation, which he now employed to leave his body and travel on the\nastral plane, where he succeeded in locating God in the form of Brahma.\n\nWithout any ceremony of introduction, and in a very disrespectful manner,\nhe began to criticize the god: \"Hey, Brahma, what is the matter with you? Why\n\ndon't you stand up and greet me?\"\n\nBrahma was astonished at the audacity of this mortal and retorted: ''Do\nyou know to whom you are talking?\" \"Yes,\" replied Bhrigu, \"of course! I\nknow that I am talking to that despicable god who is the creator of vermin,\nplagues, mosquitoes, diseases, criminals, and all ugly things in creation.\nWhy don't you reform and create only good things?\"\n\nBrahma said threateningly: ''Get back to earth before I convert you to stone\nby the gorgon gaze of my will. \" Saint Bhrigu laughed and turned to leave, say-\ning: 'Oh, no, you won't. You cannot make me into a stone, for God and I are\none!'' At these words, Brahma awoke from his error and apologized. Then\nSaint Bhrigu said: 'I forgive you, Brahma, but I am disappointed not to have\nfound in you what I wanted to see.\"\n\nThen Saint Bhrigu repaired to Shiva, who was just getting ready to meditate\non all the things beyond their prime that must be brought to an end. As soon as\nBhrigu's gaze fell upon Shiva's form, the saint shouted rudely: ''Hey, Shiva,\nyou Cosmic Killer, why don't you stop shattering worlds, murdering innocent\nbabies, and inventing ingenious death-dealing devices? Why don't you cease\ndestroying the beautiful and useful things and beings of the earth and get busy\nannihilating all the wicked things?\"\n\nShiva could not believe his ears--that a mortal man like Saint Bhrigu could\nbe so reckless and free with his speech. He thundered: \"Quiet! or I will\nreduce you to ashes with the burning magnetism of my spiritual eye. '' Saint\nBhrigu derisively retorted: ''Fine use you will make of your spiritual eye! Go\n\nahead, I dare you to burn up the God in me!'' Shiva remained speechless at\nthe awakening words of Saint Bhrigu, who soon melted away from his sight,\nsaying: ''Oh, what a disappointment you are!\"\n\nAlmost despairing, Saint Bhrigu skeptically looked up the third god, Vishnu,\nwho controlled the preserving principle of the Cosmos. But this time he stayed\non earth and sought out the prophet Krishna--in whom Vishnu's great powers\nwere manifesting in a human incarnation. Saint Bhrigu found Lord Krishna\nsound asleep on a sofa in his palace. Bhrigu stood there watching the halo of\npeace radiating from the beautiful face of the Divine One. Then, unable to\nthink of any other way to test him, Saint Bhrigu kicked Sri Krishna on the chest,\nshouting: ''You sleeping fool, wake up and see who is here!\" Sri Krishna awak-\nened with the sweetest, most undismayed, loving smile.

In the beginning of his life he is\nengrossed mostly in his instinctive animal appetites. That is why children are\nanimal-like in early life. They pass the time in eating, digging, fidgeting, and\nfrisking here and there without any purpose, just like the animals. There are\nmany adults too who are only human automatons; they have never grown men-\ntally. Though they may be fifty or older, they don't have the mentality of a\nreally intelligent child. Such people are animalistic in that they act instinctive-\nly rather than according to reason; they can hardly converse intelligently, or\nplan and live life according to a definite ambition.\n\nThe quickening of human evolution is caused by the development of intuition\nthrough concentration. Concentration-born intuition directly perceives truth\nfrom within. Intuition thus developed can reveal the real nature of substance,\nand perceive the Noumena behind all phenomena. The usual method of learning\nby mental conception depends on sense experience and the power of inference,\nwhich can only explain the appearance of things. That is why attaining knowledge\nthrough the intelligence alone seers an endless task. One lifetime does not pro-\nvide enough time in which to learn all the mysteries of heaven and earth through\nthe ordinary mediums of mechanical schooling, sense experience, and inferen-\ntial education. The best way to discover real truth is to use the all-knowing\npower of intuition given to us by God.\n\nThrough intuition you can know any phase of truth correctly and directly\nwithout the medium of the senses. If you are not meditating and thus quickening\nyour intuition, you will roam for many incarnations until you have gathered\nenough intuitional experience to know all truth and thereby become omniscient,\nas Spirit is. You were created as omniscient as Spirit; you have lost that intu-\nitive power by depending for your knowledge entirely upon your senses and mind.\nIn order to quicken your intuition you should start learning truth from inner\nmeditative experience, and not depend for your knowledge solely upon books\nand schools.\n\nBY DEVELOPING INTUITION YOU QUICKEN EVOLUTION\n\nThe education of one's intuition should not wait for youth or adulthood; it\nshould begin in childhood. If children are accustomed to gaining knowledge only\nthrough so-called intellectual smartness, their inner door of intuition is closed\nby the hand of self-sufficiency; then God and infinite truth remain shut out of\n\n"}

Asa result of prac-\nticing these techniques, children should from early life reveal intuitive facul-\nties by which they grasp knowledge with extraordinary quickness.\n\nEducation does not consist in pumping ideas and the contents of books into\nthe brain, but in developing intuition and bringing the hidden memory of all\nknowledge--already existing in the soul--back to the plane of human conscious-\nness. The proof is that whenever a real truth is told to you for the first time,\nyou think as you grasp its import, ''This seems familiar. I feel I already knew\nthis to be true!\"\n\nAll seemingly new truths are in reality old hidden truths of the soul and of\nSpirit; they give us joy by becoming familiar to us again. Older people should\nhave learned by their own errors and ought now to endeavor to save children\nfrom committing similar errors. This is the greatest way to liberate humani-\nty, using wisdom to bring erring brothers back to the heavenly mansion of joy\nand final freedom.\n\nBy developing intuition, you quicken evolution. Teach children to quicken\ntheir own evolution through methods of meditation.

They should be taught to meditate deeply for half\nan hour in the morning and again in the evening, sitting with spine erect and\npracticing calmness, lack of anxiety, and peaceful lovingness.\n\nAS YOU SOW, SO SHALL YOU REAP\n\nYou have read the parable of the man who sowed some seeds. A few fell by\nthe wayside and some fell on stones; some seeds were taken away by the birds\nof the air; other seeds were watered for a little while but later became neglected\nuntil lack of water finally destroyed the tiny plants they put forth.

You must go from this\nearth alone, and everyone else will be powerless to help you. Don't forget!\nEarth-life is only a caravanserai where the soul stops for a while.

It is time we retrace our footsteps Home and reach finally that\ndivine Kingdom wherein we shall be free from all suffering and heartaches.\n\nQUICKEN YOUR EVOLUTION BY CONCENTRATION\n\nYou can quicken your evolution by increasing the power of concentration. By\nincreasing concentration, you will highly develop your receptivity to wisdom.\nWhen you increase your capacity to grasp quickly the meaning and purpose of the\nproblems of life, and to find their solution, then your liberation will be hastened.\nDo not live the unreasoning animalistic life of ordinary people who do not know\nanything better than eating, sleeping and multiplying. By evolution out of ani-\nmalistic life, Imean evolution beyond the plane of mechanical living--of acting\nlike automatons. For adult human automatons and ignorant children both lead\nunawakened, mechanical lives, almost like animals.\n\nNevertheless, children and animals are sleeping immortals. You should\nteach them rightly to quicken their evolution, otherwise they remain helpless,\nunable to give utterance to their sorrows or desires. The intuition of the human\nrace can be quickly developed only through intuitive meditation, and not by the\nendless process of formal man-made education.\n\nTo lift children to the intuitive plane, to spiritualize human automatons, to\ntransmute any animalistic instincts in yourself and thus quicken your own and\nanimal evolution is a great task. You must first find God in yourself and thus\nbe able to behold Him in all other living creatures. When you can really feel\nGod within and without, you will know that it is God alone who has become\neverything, and that all created things are God-vibrations.\n\n"}

Concentration means to gather\nin your attention, focusing it to a point; condensation means to uSe that concen-\ntrated attention to do something quickly that ordinarily would take a long time.\nBy concentration you can condense each experience and garner whatever wis-\ndom is to be learned from it. By condensation of individual experiences you\ncan compress all your experiences, and the wisdom they contain, into a short-\ner length of time and thus gain much more than if you go through life haphazard-\n\nly.\n\nThe world starts the process of improvement with books and material\nmethods. You should start by increasing the receptivity of your intuition. In\nyou lies the seat of infinite knowledge. Calmness, concentration, and conden-\nsation of experiences by intuitional perception will make you master of all\nknowledge.

One\nday long after, as I was bathing in the river, the children came running and\nsaid, ''We have found a deer. '' I ran out of the water and there was my deer. I\nknew God had given it tome. That deer used to sleep in my room and come\nnear my bed--and how I loved it!\n\nOne day, because I was going to be away from the school, I fed the pet\nearlier than usual. I told the students not to feed it again, for I intuitively\nfeared that something serious would happen if they did. Sad to relate, one boy\nwas disobedient and gave the baby deer a large quantity of milk. When I returned,\nthe deer was almost dead. I prayed God not to take my pet away, and began to\nmeditate. Hours later the deer stood up and walked feebly. The boys cheered.\nGod had given the deer back to me. | ।\n\nI stayed up until two o'clock, when I fell asleep. Ina dream the astral form\nof my deer appeared to me and said: ''You are holding me back. Please let me.\ngo! Let me go!\" \"All right, '' lanswered in my dream. Ilawoke immediately\nand cried out, ''The deer 18 dying!'' The whole school awakened, and the boys\nrushed to my side. The deer made a last effort to get up, stumbled toward me,\nthen dropped at my feet, dead.\n\nAccording to the mass karma which guides and regulates the destinies of\nanimals, the deer's life was over, and it was ready to progress into a higher\nform. But by my deep attachment, which I later realized was selfish, and by\nmy fervent prayers, I had been able to hold it in the limitations of the animal\nform from which the soul was struggling for release.

The ignorant man sees only the unsurmountable\nwall of death, hiding, seemingly forever, his cherished friends. But the man\nof unattachment, he who loves others as expressions of the Lord, understands\nthat at death the dear ones have only returned for a breathing space of joy in\nHim.\n\nThe attention, intuition, and evolution of animals can be quickened through\ntraining by an intuitive person.

Most people who do not try to look into the meaning of\nlife lead mechanical existences, doing only the kind of work that happens to\ncome in their path. They have become slaves of the environment in which they\nwere born, and are whipped by their own habits to run in only one direction\nof activity.\n\nThe world influences you to sow the seeds of useless bad habits, material\ndesires, and God-forgetting activities; but the world does not have to answer\nfor your poisonous harvest. You alone are held accountable for the effects of\nyour actions. When you are about to die, the world says good-by to you, leav-\ning you to answer to your conscience forthe effects of activities that you per-\nformed under its evil influence.

You\nshould control your own life henceforth; you should become the ruler of your\nown mental kingdom. Fears, worries, discontent, and unhappiness all result\nfrom a life uncontrolled by wisdom.\n\nIf you are seeking happiness, then in your own interest you should make\nyour life as it should be--calm, confident, and joyous--not a scene of warring\nworries. You should understand that a balanced life consists first in acquir-\ning supreme satisfaction through the attainment of all-conquering wisdom.\nWhen you acquire real mental poise through wisdom, you will automatically\nbe able to acquire prosperity and health. ।\n\nNow we must consider the method of attaining this end.

Concentrate upon one thing at a time one thing at a time.\n\n2. .Perform the most important, useful, and necessary duties of life first,\nand concentrate upon them until they are finished.\n\n3. By the following method, cultivate the power of concentration; apply that\nconcentration on God and reinforce yourself with His power. Then, feel-\ning His powerful presence through actual inner communion, go about life's\nduties with concentration, with one-pointed attention reinforced by God's\nunlimited power. This practice will ultimately secure wisdom for you,\nand any other form of prosperity that your heart desires.\n\nRemember, only attunement to God's unfailing law can give you scientific\nsuccess. To obtain superconcentration requires first that you develop your\nown concentration. It becomes superconcentration when you increase it to\nlimitless accomplishing power by combining it with God's power.\n\nSPECIAL EXERCISE FOR DEVELOPING CONCENTRATION\n\nIn the morning, as soon as your consciousness comes back into the brain;\nfor fifteen minutes during the lunch hour; and also before going to bed, practice\nthe following:\n\nLie motionless on your back. Keep the body relaxed. Offer a deep prayer\nof devotion to God in the language of your heart. Continuously offer this prayer\nuntil you feel that God has responded. Know, through the increase of your\ninner peace and satisfaction, that God has heard you. Forget time, orthat you\nare busy; with your eyes closed, concentrate upon the point between the eye-\nbrows. .(Keep your inner gaze and your mind fixed there throughout the prac-\ntice of this method. ) Now exhale, and while the breath is out, continue to con-\ncentrate on the point between the eyebrows and mentally chant over and over,\nfor as long as you can comfortably remain without breath: ''Om-Spirit-Christ, ''\nor 'Om-Spirit-Bliss. Then inhale.\n\nRepeat the foregoing exercise--starting with exhalation, then chanting ''Om-\nSpirit-Christ, '' and ending with inhalation--at least twelve times; if you have\ntime, repeat it about twenty-four times. After that, offer a deep heartfelt\nprayer to God until you feel His contact through ever increasing peace. The\nsurest sign of the presence of God within you is a strange, living, consciously\nresponding peace looming up from within you. You can feel this only as a\nresult of meditation (in this or a past life) and in no other way. Tne more you\nconcentrate, the longer and more deeply you concentrate, the greater will be\nthe increase of this peace, which is the language of God. Peace derived from\nsuperconcentration is the power of God within you. After you find this deep\npeace within you, then affirm:\n\n"}

Thou art slowly rising\non the horizon of my mind; mists of ignorance are clearing with the\ncoming of the moonbeams of Thy love.\n\n11.\nTHE TEST OF THE SCRIPTURES: DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF GOD\n\nOrdinarily, a phenomenon is known by the senses, perceived by the mind\nand cognized by the inner ego. All human experiences depend for their data\nupon the testimony of the senses. The power of inference comes after and\ndraws conclusions from the material supplied by the senses. A person see-\ning what appears to be smoke rising from a distant hill may conclude that\nthe hill is on fire, because he had seen fire and smoke together before. But\nlet us say that in this case it was not smoke but a cloud of dust on the hill.\nThe data furnished by the senses being wrong, the conclusion is wrong. Al-\nthough the power of inferential reasoning has its uses, still it is subject to\nerror and hence is incapable of proving conclusively the ultimate nature of\nReality.\n\nThe vast physical universe is in reality an ocean of energy lying about us\n--high overhead as rivers of the milky way, twinkling stars, and solar sys-\ntems; beneath our feet as solid earth. Sparkling lakes, great mountains,\nheaving oceans, sky, air, and fire; man's physical body and his ethereal\nthoughts -- all are but vibrations of one Cosmic Energy. Yet the senses\nmake differentiations that tell us a delusive story--that solids hurt us, liquid\ndrowns us, fire burns us, sky does not hold us, and gas suffocates us.\n\nAs the substance we call water may appear as ice, steam, or hydrogen-\noxygen gas, sothe universe appears iin various forms, as the solid earth,\noceans, and vapors. Our senses tellus only of the most superficial aspect\nof matter, deceiving us into thinking that ice is cold, heavy, and solid, and\nthat steam is hot and fluid. Yet all are manifestations of one and the same\nsubstance. All the elements of which the universe is comprised are made of\none electronic energy, conscious Cosmic Energy.\n\nOur senses do not tell us the whole truth: that the electrons ina small\npencil could explode a skyscraper, for example, and that the energy released\nfrom the electrons constituting a human body could explode a part of Mount\nEverest. If our senses conveyed the whole truth to us, we would see the\nearth as rivers and glaciers of electrons, each speck of dust as a rolling\n\nmass of light. | ।\n\n"}

That is true up toa point. We\nhave to remember that all the knowledge derived from the experiments car-\nried on by the help of the microscope, mathematics, and fine instruments has\nto come through the senses; but the senses--and the reason, working on their\ntestimony--have told only a fraction of the truth about the nature of matter and\nall things. Only recently atoms were considered ultimate--now upon further\nanalysis they have been found to contain the finer materials of electrons and\nprotons. Thus neither the senses nor the power of inference that builds know-\nledge on sense testimony can be trusted to tell us all the truth about the earth,\nthe universe, the human body, or the mind.\n\nWe are controlled by something that operates like radio--active and vital\nenergy broadcast by God! Ships can be moved by radio; similarly we are con-\ntrolled by the \"broadcasts\" of the Infinite Spirit, which is present everywhere.\n= the point is this--just as the sunlight falling on the water in a cup that is\nkept moving becomes broken up into myriad suns, so Spirit, being reflected\nin each human body and mind, has become reflected there as individualized\nSpirit or Soul. Now, although this Soul is a reflection of Spirit, it has become\nidentified with the body, and is trying very hard through processes of evolu-\ntion to resurrect itself from the cage of the body and return to the Ocean of\nSpirit. If you have a cup filled with water and you hold it under a lamp, at the\nsame time causing the water to move in the cup, you have a distorted reflec -\n\n` tion of the Iamplight in the cup. Resurrecting the reflected Soul image signi-\n\nfies taking it away from the moving cup of restless consciousness, and re-\nuniting it with the original all-pervading undistorted Light.\n\nThe soul, a reflection of the Spirit in the body, is caged in the body,\nhence it has put on all the limitations of the body and of the mind. Therefore,\nwe must resurrect the soul from the thralldom of the body and the mind and\nreunite it with the Spirit.\n\nREALIZATION AND The followers of every great religious belief claim\nSCRIPTURAL TRUTHS their scriptures to be of divine origin, but how can\none find out which book represents truth? The\n\nnumber of believers cannot be the proof. The belief of the millions of follow-\ners of the Christian Bible or the Hindu Vedas cannot establish the immutable\nuniversal nature of the principles in the scriptures. The Bible is interpreted\nvariously according to man's own degree of development and power of reason-\ning. That is why there are so many cults deriving from a universal teaching\nsuch as that of Jesus Christ.\n\nJesus Christ's teachings cannot be understood merely by reading the\nBible over and over; only by putting them into practice in everyday life can\nyou know the teachings outlined in that great scripture. What you listen to,\nwhat you read in books, try to meditate on long enough to be one with the\nthought underlying it. Then try to manifest that realization in practice.\n\n"}

He lived several centuries before Jesus Christ, and taught that the\nauthority of the scriptures is not proof of their truth, because, no matter who\npropounds them, the scriptures have to be received through the sight, hearing,\nlimited imagination, and reasoning power of the reader. According to Patan-\njali, the real inner teachings of a Christ cannot be understood through the\ntestimony of others, nor by listening to their interpretations, but can be\ngrasped only by the power of direct intuitive perception.\n\nनमेः\nTHOUGHTS TO LIVE BY\n\nEvery theory and belief should be practiced and its truth verified by real-\nization.

On the other hand, skepticism\nis harmful too if it betokens only a refusal to investigate further. In sucha\ncase it leads only to the self-inflicted punishment of doubt.\n\nThe real inner meanings of the Christ teachings cannot be understood\nthrough the testimony of others, nor by listening to their interpretations, but\ncan be grasped only by intuition. Whatever is intuitively true must be spiritu-\nally true, scientifically true, and true in allthe scriptures. Anything that is\nwonderful is always difficult to obtain. That is the strange psychology about\ntruths. Each one who reads the Bible thinks that he understands it all, but it\n18 necessary to crack the shell of these truths and realize their true meanings\nthrough intuition.\n\nIKK IK\nSIX BLIND BOYS AND AN ELEPHANT\n\nee, are numerous legends and stories about elephants. Even the phi-\nlosophers of India used the elephant to illustrate a great moral.\n\nOur legend tells how an Indian mahout (driver) commanded his six blind\nsons to wash the family elephant. The six blind boys took great pride in this\nopportunity given them by their good father, and each one was extremely\ncareful in the diagnosis of his first experience with the elephant. Each boy\nwas given a certain portion of the elephant's body to wash. All were delighted\nto have this chance to learn something about elephants.\n\nAfter an hour, when the elephant washing was over, the six blind boys\n\n"}

The first son, who had been washing the elephant's\ntrunk, scornfully said: ''You are talking nonsense. The elephant is just like\n\na bamboo pole.

The elephant is like two big banana leaves. \"'\n\nHearing what he thought to be absurd remarks from his brothers, the\n\nfourth son, who had been washing the four legs of the elephant, cried out:\n\"You are all wrong. It is ridiculous for you to fight about something you evi-\ndently know nothing about. The elephant is only a large roof of flesh supported\nEq four fleshly pillars.\"\n\nThe fifth son, who has been washing the tusks of the elephant, was beside\nhimself with laughter, and spoke up: ''My blundering brothers, listen to me.\nIdeclare, as a result of personal experience, that the elephant is nothing but\na couple of bones. '' This was too much for the sixth son, who had washed the\ntail of the elephant, and he said: ''All of you must be crazy, or under the\nspell of hallucinations. The elephant is only a piece of rope hanging from\n\nheaven. ' He, being the youngest and quite short, could not reach to the top\nof the elephant's tail, hence he thought that the elephant was a \"heavenly rope\"\nsuspended just above the earth by the gods.\n\nThe father, who had been cooking some rice for the elephant in a nearby\nplace, heard in great merriment all this squabble about the animal, but he\ncame running to his children when their argument waxed into a free-for-all\nfight. ''You assorted young fools, stop this fighting!'' he commanded. \"All\nof you are right and yet all are wrong.\"\n\nThe boys cried in unison: ''How can that 087\" To which the father replied:\n\"It is I who have seen the whole elephant, and I know that you are all right be-\ncause you have each one described a part of the elephant.

My earthly desires shall die,\nand I will live in Thee forever.\n\n५.९४\n\nRK\n\nOVERCOMING FEAR OF DEATH\n\nWhat is Life? A wave of electrons and atoms, a wave of protoplasm, a\nwave of power, a wave of consciousness. Life is intelligent, organized motion.\nIt may mold itself into a clod of earth or melt itself into vapor--it may take the\nform of a living, moving being or that of a still corpse. Stones, animated\nbeings, dead creatures, all are waves in the ocean of life. There is no death\nnor cessation of motion in anything. Everything is living.\n\nA wave is born; it rises to its supreme height, then falls, to rise again\nsomewhere. Like everything else in this vibratory universe, the human body is\na combination of three coexisting waves--of electrons, life force, and intelli-\ngence knit together by a soul--rolling up and down the ocean of Life. The birth\nof the baby is the rise, youth is the crest, and death the fall of the human body\nwave in the infinite ocean of Life.\n\nDEATH IS Physical pain, as in long-continued disease, and mental suf-\nA REWARD fering are sometimes worse than death, which brings cessa-\n\ntion of physical pain. Oft-dreaded death is a natural change\nof the body, a deep sleep earned after a long term of activity in the office of\nlife. Death by suicide, however, is a spiritual crime, because it involves the\nquitting of the duties or the tests of life. The person who commits suicide is\ndenied the privilege of peace that attends the rightly won pension of death. He\nwho deserts this earth as a coward cannot be granted the pension of rest.\n\nBoth physical pain and mental suffering originate inthe mind. A man suf-\nfers more to see his beloved wife operated upon than he would if he were to see\nहै... मे stranger's wife undergoing surgery. He would suffer still more if he had to\nsee his own body being operated upon. Sensations in one's own body or in the\nbodies of others have to be accepted by the mind in order to produce pain or\nsuffering. Sensitive people feel pain and suffering more than others. If a man's\nmind is disengaged from the body by superior means, such as meditation, or\nby artificial means, such as chloroform, and he is operated upon, he does not\nfeel pain. It is absolutely true that if man's mind and feelings were rightly\ntrained, he could watch an operation on his body without feeling pain.\n\nCAGED BIRD As the fear, in children, of going into the dark is aggravated\n\nOF MIND by tales of ghosts and goblins, so the fear of death has be-\ncome instilled in man by ignorant imaginings. One should\n\nrather be consoled at the thought of death as the necessary end of all physical\n\n"}

If we were to acquaint our-\nselves with the real nature of death, we would find there is nothing to fear.\nThe soul grows attached to the physical wave of the body, with its waves of life\nand intelligence, and fears to leave it; just as a bird, long used to a cage, hesi-\ntates to leave it even though the doors are opened. The bird's confinement in\nthe cage has made it forgetful of its free flights in the open skies. The bird\nthinks, ''Where willl go? What will happen to me beyond? Let me remain in\nthe cage.'' Similarly the caged soul, accustomed to the limitations, diseases,\nand frailties of the body, is afraid of the safe, infinite, celestial regions of God,\neven when invited by death to make a change from the limited to a less limited\nstate.\n\n= weight and feeling in the body, the love of sensual pleasures, sunlight,\n\nvoices of friends, ties of family, love of warmth or cold, dependence on oxygen\nfor life, love for food, dress, automobiles, furniture, houses--these are the\ncommon attachments of life that keep the soul body-bound.\n\nThe baby is ''dead'' when it becomes a youth; similarly, when an aged man\ndies, he merely changes one state for another. If life is lived rightly, death is\na reward and a change to a better state. Some quit life, being forced out by\n\n_ failures in health or as victims of the consequences of their own wrong ways of //_\nliving. But even such failures cannot be permanent stigmas on the soul. Each\nhuman being has new opportunities in other schools of life, if he has to be ex-\npelled from this one by the exacting schoolmaster, Death.\n\nACTUAL Many yogis in India can say with St. Paul, ''Verily, I protest\nPHENOMENON by our rejoicing which I have in Christ, Idie daily.'' Death\nOF DEATH may be either an involuntary or a voluntary switching off of\n\nthe life current from the bulb of flesh. Yogis who know how\nto operate the switch of the heart, and to control their heartbeats, can quit the\nbody quickly and at will; or stay in it as long as they wish. I shall try to de-\nscribe the actual phenomenon of death just as I have experienced it.\n\nWhen death comes it is variously experienced by different people, accord-\ning to their earthly mode of living. Just as different people enjoy sleep of vari-\nous duration and quality, so different people have varying experiences of death.\nThe good man who works hard in the factory of life goes to a deep, unconscious\nbut restful sleep for a short while; he then wakes up again in some other region\nof life in the astral world. (\"पा my Father's house are many mansions'\"'--John\n14:2.) A man who neglects the duties of life or who causes confusion and dis-\ncomfiture of others often experiences something like nightmares or terrible\ndreams during death. Tne moral man often has delightful dreams at death.\nThe wise man finds through death an infinitely better, safer haven than this\nmudball of earth flying through the sky.\n\nWhen your leg goes to sleep you can See it, but you cannot feel it as some-\n\n"}

If it had\nnot been for her brother's courage, which had stimulated her will sufficiently\nto energize her fast-deadening and rebellious muscles and nerves, she would\nhave slipped away from the body. It is highly unwise to discuss the condition\nof a dying man within range of his hearing. His body or speech may be para-\nlyzed, but not necessarily his hearing.\n\nOnly those who have practiced control of the heartbeat and who have learned\nto live without oxygen--by eating less carbonizing food and by preventing the\ndecay of tissues in the body through definite yoga training in meditation--can\nconsci ously experience death at will. For them it is merely a rest from con-\nstant muscular activity, particularly from the involuntary activity of the heart,\nlungs, diaphragm, and circulation that we associate with the presence of life.\nThat life is not dependent either on food or oxygen is proved by verified cases\nof men who have lived long ina state of suspended animation.\n\nIn heaven there are no crackers and soup; no breakfast, lunch, dinner; no\nwater, oxygen, sunshine. Mortals who desire to go there should learn to live\nmore by inner energy, unattached to the body. Those who learn in this life to\nlive by Spirit, and who are unattached to the body, quickly realize after death\nthe freedom of the soul from bondage of oxygen, food, and water. Death is\nfeared only by the ignorant human animal--the wise see it as a transition to a\nhigher NES as a promotion to higher grades in the school of life.\n\nEven if you are not yet perfected in the art of living primarily by direct\nlife-energy, as the great yogis of India and as developed Self-Realization Fel-\nlowship students do, you can begin your march toward freedom by ceasing to\nbe attached to the care of the body: eating, sleeping, exercising, and so on.\nPerform your duty to the body with joy but with nonattachment. More and more\nyou will realize this truth, that man_is a soul, but has a body, and you will no\nlonger dread parting with the fleshly garment. Such dread is a self-inflicted\ntorture brought on by ignorant attachment to the body or to material posses-\nsions. Tne unenlightened dying man suffers through imagination even though\nin death he receives freedom from physical pain and leaves a minor, inferior | ।\nstate for a higher one, in which he is temporarily free of the mortal physical\nconsciousness,\n\n"}

The soul itself, being individualized Spirit, manifests only its essential\nundivided relation with the Spirit and the inherent quality of Spirit: ever exist-\ning, ever conscious, ever new Bliss. A reflection of the unmanifested Spirit,\nthe soul is itself individualized, ever existing, ever conscious, ever new Bliss.\nBut as the soul takes on an ideational, an astral, and a physical body, and the\nnormal and abnormal conditions of these three bodies, it also takes on or\nidentifies itself with their natures. This is the ego, or pseudo-soul state of\nconsciousness.\n\nThe physical, astral, and ideational planes all have to be cognized through\nconsciousness and their effects on it. The advancing student on the path of\nmeditation should be extremely watchful of King Soul, in the guise of matter-\nstricken ego, in its wanderings in the different realms of consciousness.\n\nDuring the state of wakefulness, the human ego ordinarily travels in the\nrealm of sensation or awareness of the physical body and of the material world.\nBut when the curtain of sleep is drawn, the ego withdraws to the chamber of\ndreams, where it wanders in a semiconscious state. The ego is not aware of\nactual physical sensations, yet it is dimly conscious of the astral dream-world.\nTaking a rest from the consciousness of the physical world, the ego rises to\nthe dream world on the astral plane, and looks on semiconsciously during the\nmotion picture showings in the dream movie house. This is indicated by the\nfact that the ego is dimly conscious of the dream pictures during their perform-\nance,and is able also to recall those dreams in memory during the ''relapse\"'\ninto the ordinary consciousness of the wakeful state.\n\nDuring the perception of dreams, the ego is only semiconscious of the\nworld, and sense experiences; yet it may be at the same time entirely conscious\nof the dream world. The linking channel between the conscious and subconscious\nminds is unbroken; otherwise, the memories of dreams could not be recalled in\nconscious mental states. There is no actual unconsciousness; consciousness\nmay sleep or rest, but it can never be unconscious. In sleep the consciousness\nis resting, i.e., not active. The soul is never unconscious. @\n\n"}

But consciousness, although divested of its physical sense\ninstruments of expression, still retains, as the subconsciousness, its intuitive\npowers of cognition; through them it consc iously beholds, in the chamber of\nsleep, dreams compounded of subconscious memories, thoughts, and reactions\nof the subtle senses (which are the mental or astral counterparts of the physi-\ncal senses). In dreamland, just as in waking consciousness, you may enjoy the\nsensory experiences of eating ice cream or hot pie, for example. But when the\nego enters the silent chamber of deep sleep, or the chamber of semisupercon-\nsciousness, its experiences consist of unalloyed enjoyment of peace. The\nhuman consciousness, turning interiorly backward here, begins to resume its\nnormal, essential state of divine calmness, peace, and joy.\n\nThe conscious state ordinarily is marked by restlessness; the ego becomes\n\ngrossly excited or pleased in the house of physical sensations. The subconscious\n\nstate is characterized by a mixture of peace and activity as the ego is subtly\n\nexcited or pleased in the movie house of dreams. But peace reigns in the super-\n\nconsciousness; hence the ego is peaceful when, in deep sleep, it enters the bor-\ndering realm of semisuperconsciousness.\n\nDuring its stay in the chamber of sensations in the state of physical con-\nsciousness, the ego remains linked with subconsciousness through the memory,\n\nunmanife sted.\n\nTHE TRAINED AND During wakeful hours the conscious mind is predomi-\nUNTRAINED EGO nant; the subconscious and superconscious minds re-\nmain in the background.

The subtle astral subconscious is manifest-\n\ned through dreams and quiet negative sleep, and through memory (which never\n\nsleeps).\n\nTrue yogis and swamis have superconsciousness predominating both in the\nwakeful and the sleep state. Consciousness, subconsciousness, and supercon-\nsciousness are different degrees or states of Christ Consciousness. They can\nnever remain apart, but one state can be stronger than the others. The ordinary\nman works with the waking consciousness predominant, and the yogi works with\nsuperconsciousness predominant.\n\nAsk yourself during the day at different times: ‘What consciousness is pre-\ndominant in me?\" Constantly strive to change your center of consciousness from\nphysically conscious to superconscious predominance.\n\nPsychological and physiological states being closely connected, certain\npsychological states are attended with certain corresponding physical manifesta-\ntions, and vice versa. Be angry and your face will show it. Then reverse the\nprocess: Adopt an expression of anger in the facial muscles; keep on showing\nanger by imitating its physical reactions, and you will begin to develop psycho-\nlogical anger.\n\nThe accomplished yogi, by adopting certain psychological states, can pro-\nduce certain physiological states; and, conversely, by manifesting certain physi-\ncal states he can instantaneously produce corresponding psychological states.\nFor example, during subconscious manifestation the eyes are closed; by closing\nhis eyes, the accomplished yogi is able to produce instantaneous sleep anytime,\nanywhere. Further, he knows that during the state of wakefulness the eyes are\nfully open, generally leveled; by keeping the eyes level, the determined yogi\ncan remain consciously awake indefinitely. He knows also that during the super-\nconscious state--and at death, in which the soul races toward the superconscious-\nness--the eyes turn upward. So, by lifting his eyes upward and concentrating\nhis vision in between the eyebrows, he can switch off at will the motion pictures\nof subconscious dreams or of physical sensations and launch his consciousness\ninto the land of luminosity where electronic life-forces, peace, and joy reign--\nthe kingdom of Spirit.\n\nमे मर मर\n\n"}

He carried a knapsack containing flour and a piece of sourdough\nfor making bread. A gold seeker might disappear for months in search of nuggets\nof gold, and his life depended upon the chance caribou meat he might obtain by\nhunting, and upon the leavened bread he made from sourdough, In fact, these\nprospectors were called ''sourdoughs\" because of their habit of carrying sour-\n\ndough everywhere they went in pursuit of gold.\n\nAn amusing fantasy is told about one of them. It is said that by a stroke of\nluck (good karma) a sourdough chanced to slip into Heaven, where he created\ndiscomfiting mischief for the gods. The heavenly deities, with their bright\ngolden automobiles, had a hard time bumping over the streets of Elysium, which\nformerly had been smoothly paved with gold, because the sourdough had rutted\nthe streets by digging them for gold, All the celestial inhabitants complained to\nSt. Peter about this gold-greedy sourdough!s persistent and ceaseless gold dig-\nging on the highways and byways of Heaven.

Meanwhile something may turn up\nto save all of you from this mischief-making sourdough.

The gods had to take to walking\nsince the heavenly policemen had declared the roads impassible. One day, St.\nPeter was standing pensively by the Pearly Gates, brooding over the possibility\nof getting rid of the troublesome sourdough, when a rusty-looking, shabby man\narrived, ''Well, who are you?\" St. Peter challenged. The old prospector replied:\n\n11\n\n\"I am a sourdough; let me in.\n\n\"Oh, no indeed!'' replied St. Peter. ''You will have to go back, for we are\nhaving a rough time already with one wily sourdough who has marred every golden\nstreet in Heaven.'' The prospector was insistent: \"St. Peter, I promise you\nthat I will not dig up the streets of Heaven; and I will vouch for the ejection of the\nother sourdough if you will let me in.\"\n\nAt this St. Peter finally yielded.

Then I shall behold the in-\nfinite perfect light forever dancing on God's fountain of\n\nbliss.\nKKK\n\nREVERSING THE SEARCHLIGHTS OF THE SENSES--Part 2\n\nSELF -REALIZATION Self-realization is attained only through step-by-\n\nstep development. By means of maya, the cosmic\ndelusive force, God is holding the searchlights of your senses so that you are\nattracted toward matter. The minute you try to turn your mind toward God,\nit wants to turn you senseward.\n\nIt is essential that you sit upright. This is the first step toward success-\nfully practicing the techniques. When you sit with your spine bent and you\nlean over, what do you immediately think? That you are ready to give up.\nYou must sit as if you mean business. In India we had to practice that for\nmonths before we were permitted to receive any spiritual instruction.\n\nA bent spine is an enemy of Self-realization Self-realization. Your mind will be on the\nbent spine; you will be muscle-bound. The electric currents of your life force\n\nwill be busy with the muscles and flesh, and you will be unable to concentrate\nupon God. Practice this discipline over the body, and your mind will be free\nto lift your consciousness from the body to the Infinite.\n\nThe next step is to cultivate the feeling of expansion. As often as you\nlook at the little body, so often are you conscious that you are limited to the\nbody. You forget that your kingdom is Omnipresence. Look in the mirror\nand see what you have done to yourself. Age is nothing in itself, but when you\naccept the idea of age and its limitations for yourself, that is bad. You should\nalways be sparkling within with infinite wit and light. God is twinkling behind\nyour eyes, but you screen Him off. Remember that behind the darkness of\nclosed eyes is the light of God. And that kingdom is yours. Your soul nature\nis omnipresent. Your home is eternity.\n\nSo you see, all possessions of the earth, no matter how great they may\nbe, are limited compared to that which is already yours. If you merely roll\non the top of an emotional wave, you cannot feel God, for your comprehension\nis limited and superficial. Meditation is the way to expand your consciousness\nfrom the body to the Infinite. You don't have to forget the body, but include\nyour body in this expansion. You must be able to feel this expansion. You\nmust be able to feel space, and the thoughts of others. Your consciousness\nthen will be omnipresent. The feeling of expansion is not a blind negation of\n\n"}

All the different techniques of meditation that have been given to\nyou will expand your consciousness. The sense of expansion has many steps\nbefore you reach the consciousness of Omnipresence. How many of these.\nstages can you feel? How much of what lies about you can you feel?\n\nAs soon as you enter a room, your consciousness is almost omnipresent\nin it because you are feeling the movements of other people around you, and\nsensing sounds and noises and perceiving shapes and colors. Your mind is\nmore expanded. It is awakening, not falling asleep. You should expand that\nawakening, and in meditation you should feel that same awakening and expan-\nsion. Some people fall asleep during meditation, but that is no better than\nbeing dead. You don't want that. You must be wide awake. If you have a\nspell of sleepiness, shake it off; tense the body all over and sleep will disap-\ntj Fresh air helps to keep one awake too.\n\nBefore meditation you should prepare your mind so that it will be calm.\nSelf-realization is just like a tender seedling. You must water it with medita-\ntion and grow a hedge around this little plant so that marauding dogs of wor-\nries, fears, and anger will not destroy it. Meditate and keep your mind con-\nstantly pointed toward the north pole of God's consciousness. Be like the\ncompass: no matter where it is turned, the little needle goes back to the\n__..__north pole; so should the needle of your consciousness be constantly attracted 2\n@ toward God. Be with God every minute. Enjoy everything in companionship\nwith the Infinite and you will be happy in that consciousness.\n\nEXERCISE FOR PRACTICE Sit erect. Close your eyes. Throw the\n\nbreath out. Calm yourself. Say: \"I behold\nmy thoughts as a forest of dark trees. I feed my flame of perception on these\ntrees of dark thoughts. The conflagration of my perception is spreading\nthrough all space and all space is a sphere of flame, a sphere of happiness.\nIam that. In the light of Self-realization I behold myself as an infinite sphere\nof flame. 11 Continue to visualize this.\n\nRelax your body ina sitting posture, leaning against the back of a com-\nfortable chair. Close your eyes; forget your worries; say farewell to rest-\nless thoughts; become passive. Become mentally listless, let go, reach the\nborderline between consciousness and the subconscious state. Try to doze.\nRepeat this several times until the minute you close your eyes and throw the\nsearchlights of your eyes downward and switch off the optical currents, you\ncan instantly be submerged in the subconscious which lies just beyond the\nborderline of waking consciousness.\n\nThen when you are heavy with sleep, quickly tense the whole body, and\nlift your drooping eyes; level them in front of you. Keep looking at one object\n| । without winking; banish sleep at will. Then close your eyes, relax, and fall\nasleep again.\n\n"}

Keep on suggesting to the subconscious me\nuntil it obeys. Sleep with the thought that you must get up at the appointe\nhour, for you are going to catch a train to go to a certain place to put over a\nmillion-dollar deal. After you have given the command through deep sugge 8-\ntion, direct your gaze between the eyebrows and instantaneously go conscious -\nly into the state of deep peace--deep intoxicating joy. Keep your inner mind\nfree from disturbing thoughts. Every time such thoughts come, throw them\noff; then meditate on peace. Be drunk with it. Be merged in it.

Then\ncome out consciously; level your eyes, and let your gaze roam among the\nflowers and beautiful scenery of the earth; then lift your vision up into the\nregion of the eyebrows and move into the kingdom of peace.\n\nWhen you are able to shift the searchlight of attention and energy from\nconscious to superconscious dreaming, enjoying peace at will, you shall feel\ncomplete freedom from the troubles of this mundane world. At will, you shall\nfly from the planet of sensations to the planet of dreams, or to the sphere of\neternal peace. Remember that as you change your consciousness to the sub-\nconscious, your body also should manifest all the signs of sleep: the life\nforce and energy must be switched off from the lamps of billion-celled mus-\ncles, and from the eyes and ears, and also from the olfactory and tactual\nnerves, and the nerves of taste. When shifting from the conscious to the\nsuperconscious plane, your lungs must be breathless, your heart calm, your\ncells inactive, your circulation stilled; and you must be listening to the sym-\nphony of the cosmic vibration of Om.\n\nWhile in the superconscious state, one experiences complete cessation\nof unrest, and obtains fruition of peace and soul-expansion, unhampered by\nthe friction attending sensations in the realm of ordinary consciousness. It\nwould be ridiculous to claim that one can sleep while running, for healthful\nsleep is always accompanied by sensory or motor relaxation. Just as foolish\nare people who profess to have attained Cosmic Consciousness without having\neven learned to relax at will. The first signs of the attainment of Cosmic Con-\nsciousness are: the fixed gaze, the consciously stilled heart, and breathless-\nness. If one cannot demonstrate these he has not attained Cosmic Conscious-\nness.\n\nweek\n\nTHOUGHTS TO LIVE BY\n\nThe little searchlights of our mind's attention and of the five senses ordi-\nnarily are focused on imperfect matter.

But He saw that there was no one to enjoy Him but Himself,\nso He began to create universes and to people them with beings who, although\nthey were actually a part of Himself, could enjoy Him and His dream creation\nas separate individualities. Since everything is actually part of God, the only\nway that He could give created beings such a feeling of individuality was to\ncast over all the illusion of separateness, which is called maya, or Cosmic\nDelusion. God is the ocean, and creation is the waves. As long as the storm\nof maya whips the ocean there will be individual waves; but if the storm of Cos-\nmic Delusion were to cease, the waves would all sink back into the ocean. In\norder to perpetuate the creation-making storm of delusion, God gave it indi-\nviduality also, and the power to go on independently creating and maintaining\nuniverses. This intelligent cosmic delusive force is known as Satan, an arch-\nangel of the Lord. When Satan saw that all the soul-waves and universes that\nhad been created, would, after a perfect existence, retire again into the cos-\nmic ocean of God, he reasoned: \"If creation goes back to God, then 1 shall no\nlonger exist. So Iwill resist God. For every pattern of good that is created\nI shall create a pattern of evil. Thus I shall perpetuate the cosmic storm of\ndelusion. People will be so interested in the exciting changes of maya that\nthey will forget they are immortal sons of God and that they can return to Him.\n\nHowever, good and evil are but relativities of the mortal consciousness.\nThe innate soul of man is not identified with them. When the ocean produces\nwaves out of itself, it does not change in essence. The ocean of God is the\nessence of goodness, and the individual soul-waves are composed of that same\nessence of Good. When the baby is born you can see the glory of God in it.\nYet at the same time germs are busy at its destruction. A beautiful flower is\nattacked by parasites. All physical forms are battlegrounds whereon a war of\ngood and evil is fought.\n\nSome people say that evil doesn't exist. But that is not true. If your ill-\nness is not real, why do you need healing? When you want to be healed, you\nhave accepted disease, and therefore evil, asa fact. It is inconsistent to deny\ndisease and then to seek healing; or to say that all is mind, that the body does\nnot exist, and yet to go on eating three meals a day.\n\nFor every beautiful process in life there is a contrast of suffering. Wheth-\ner a child is born out of love, out of evil, or out of passion, the pain of the mother\n\n"}

The pain is soon forgotten at the sight of\nthe baby, 80 Sweet and good. But later on that child may become a great\ntrial to its fellow creatures, causing many heartaches.\n\nWhy must we grow old? Why must some die of sickness? Why can we\nnot just melt away into the Infinite? Side by side we find good and bad tenden-\ncies: love, hate, greed, self-control. No doubt our souls are immortal, but\nwe do not express that immortality when our consciousness dwells on the\nplane of duality.\n\nMentally picture yourself with Satan on one side and God on the other.\nSatan is the metaphysical evil that deludes you into thinking that you can find\nin the changeable mortal consciousness a lasting happiness. How can you ex-\npect to find it there? It is the Unchangeable that bestows real happiness. God\nis trying all the time to catch you in the net of His unchangeable love. He is\nseeking you through pure love, pure reason, pure feeling. No matter how we\ntry to drown out the voice of God, it keeps calling us again and again. Satan\ncannot hold us forever in delusion, for delusion is only temporary; we are\neternally children of God. Although Satan has created an evil counterpart for\nevery pattern of good that God has created, His love is the greater force. The\nwrong doer finally breaks his own sword, compelled by Love. The mightiest\nblows ever dealt against Satan have been the examples offered by the lives of\n\nthe saints.\n\nThis world has two general patterns--good and bad. If evil thoughts were\nnot created by us, this world would be a much better place. However, we are\nnot responsible for all the jealousy and misunderstandings, the anger and weak\nthoughts expressed through our minds. We couldn't be! These qualities are\nborn within us and spread their poisonous tentacles until they envelop our lives.\nThis does not mean that we need not bother to try to eradicate evil or seek to\nfree ourselves from delusion. The old way of attempting to explain away evil,\nas not existing, is wrong. To fear evil is wrong too, because if you are\n\nafraid of it you are keeping it in your heart.\n\nDo not deny the existence of evil; acknowledge that it does exist. If there\nwere no evil, then there would be no use of studying anything. People contra-\ndict themselves when they say that there is no evil. Evil may not exist in God's\nconsciousness, but that does not mean that it does not exist in our conscious-\nness. God has His eyes open--He sees the true picture in its entirety--so to\nHim there is no evil. But we perceive evil because we have closed our eyes\nof wisdom and do not see the light of truth. The Christian Bible and other\nscriptures were given to us so that we might learn how to overcome evil by\n\nsubstituting good in its place.\n\nMany people think that the disease of temptation and wrong thoughts that\ncomes into their minds is entirely the result of psychological misunderstand-\nings, but it is not so. From the beginning of time, good principles have been\nfighting evil principles. It is best to remember that jealousy, anger, and\n"}

Every time peace descends after\na quarrel and you have made up your mind to be kind, the Satan in you says:\n\"You're being imposed upon; say something nasty in return. ' Don't let Satan\nwin this tug-of-war. God is all the time talking to you, but if you don't listen\nto Him, how can He help you? Every time, side by side with Satan, God is\ncalling to you. So the question is, to whom will you listen and give authority?\nNo one can influence you without your consent, because you were given free\nchoice, but there is always that delusion originated by Satan. Through the\ngood force we see the solution of problems, but that evil force keeps on creat-\ning new misunderstandings.\n\nPerfection means to be free from all mortal desires. God is almighty.\nHe can destroy Satan in a minute, but He gave that Satanic force freedom, and\nHe would go against His own laws if He destroyed that power. God foresaw\nthat some evil results would come from His creation, but He knew that the\npower of love is the stronger, so He is trying by love to bring us back from\nthe influence of Satan. When He succeeds, Satan also will be taken back into\nGod because he won't have anything then on which to work!\n\nRemember again that you are standing in the middle, free to do anything\nyou want. God is on your right side, and Satan is on your left. Every time\nyou do a good deed, God draws you, and every time you do an evil deed, Satan\npulls you on his side. But Satan cannot keep you forever because you are cre-\nated in the image of God. Love destroys evil. Every time you feel there is\nsomething wrong in you, remember that it is not you, but Satan. You have the\npower to listen to God and to ignore Satan. God never leads us into temptation,\nfor He has given us reason, the power of free choice, by which we can protect\nourselves.\n\nAs soon as hate comes into your heart, remember that Satan is trying to\ndestroy you. As soon as love comes, God is calling you. Remember these\nthings! There are patterns of evil and patterns of perfection. God is display-\ning His patterns to attract you, and Satan is displaying his patterns for the\nSame reason. Be like the saint who, while seeing these changing patterns,\nsang: ''Then life is sweet, and death a dream; then health is sweet, and 81616 = `\nness a dream, when Thy song flows through me.'' Then, you too, can say:\n\"Iam immortal, and death, life, health and sickness are only dreams. Iam\na child of God.\"\n\nTHOUGHTS TO REMEMBER Evil and sin are not inherent parts of our\nbeing.

Long before Jesus was\nborn and called \"the Christ\" the word \"Christ\" was used in India as an appella-\ntion for those great masters who had attained Cosmic Consciousness. Jesus,\nhaving attained that consciousness, and being an Oriental born after the time\nof Krishna (or Christna) was also called Christ.\n\nJadava the Christna, and Jesus the Christ, have therefore a great spiritu-\nal concomitance. Jadava the Christna could project his consciousness into all\nthe Cosmos. Jesus the Christ also had this power, by which he was aware of\nwhat was happening to others (Lazarus, for example) who were far away from\nhim.\n\nThere are many parallelisms in the stories clustered around the lives of\nthese two great incarnations of God. Both Jz2sus and Krishna were born of de-\nvout, God-fearing parents. Krishna's parents were persecuted by King Kansa;\n_-King Herod caused trouble for the mother and father of Jesus. Jesus conquered\nSatan; Krishna conquered the demon Kaliya (ignorance). Jesus stopped a storm\non the sea to save a ship carrying his disciples; Krishna, to prevent a village\nfrom being destroyed by a flood, lifted a hill over it like an umbrella.\n\nJesus was called \"King of the Jews, '' though his kingdom was not of this\nworld; Krishna was an earthly king as well as a divine one. Jesus had women\ndisciples, Mary, Martha and Mary Magdalene, who helped him and played a\nvital role in his mission; Krishna's women disciples, Radha and the gopis\n(milkmaids), similarly had divine roles to play. Krishna taught one of the great-\nest philosophies of India in the Bhagavad~-Gita; in the Christian Bible Jesus\ntaught one of the greatest'philosophies to be adopted in the West. Jesus was\ncrucified by being nailed to a cross; Krishna was mortally wounded by a hunter's\narrow. Jesus and Krishna both performed many miracles to demonstrate the\npower of God. These two divine ones are generally recognized, in the West and\nEast respectively, as the greatest incarnations of God.\n\nThere are many ways in which a devotee can worship God. Inthe Western\nworld the Father and son relationship between God and the worshiper is preva-\nlent. In India, the Mother and son relationship between God and the devotee is\npreferred because whereas the father's love is conditioned by reason, a mother's\nlove is not conditioned by anything.

God can be worshipped as a lover,\nas a beloved, as a friend, as a divine servant, as a master, or as a son.\n\nIt is said that the great woman devotee, Jasoda, wanted to look upon God\nas her son. In time it came about that she could adopt Krishna, who was an\nincarnation of God. Baby Krishna was full of childish pranks, yet he was the\n\"apple of the ९५९\" of the milkmaids and of the other people who lived in the\nsacred village of Brindaban. The milkmaids carried the milk in large pots on\nthe tops of their heads. One of little Krishna's favorite pastimes was to push\nthe maidens unexpectedly so that as they momentarily lost balance, their milk\npots slanted and poured forth milk. The miniature Niagara Falls he thus pre-\ncipitated was caught in the open mouth of Krishna, waiting expectantly below.\nThe milkmaids never complained, but loved to be taken by surprise by Krishna,\nso that he might enjoy the milk.\n\nYoung Krishna was also very fond of cheese; one day he secretly took an\nunusually large piece of cheese and beganto run. After a long chase through\nthe winding corridors of the house, Mother Jasoda caught hold of him, but it\nwas too late, because Krishna, afraid of losing his cheese, put the whole piece\nin his mouth. Krishna tightly closed his lips, but the relentless Mother Jasoda, ©\nafraid that her adored son would be choked to death, forcibly pried his jaws\nopen with her fingers in order to pull the cheese out. Baby Krishna laughed\nand opened his mouth, but behold, there was no cheese; instead, a tunnel of\neternity, with stars and worlds moving there amidst fire, smoke and thunder!\n\nMother Jasoda immediately cried out: ''Nay, nay, Baby Lord Krishna,\nclose your mouth and have your cheese. I don't want to know you as God, but\nonly as my godly baby. '' Krishna closed his mouth, apparently having swal-\nlowed the cheese. Saluting his mother, he went out to play with his neighbor-\nhood playmates.\n\nMother Jasoda, as she had looked into the tunnel of eternity, a spaceless\nforest of vastness blazing with unending light, found herself melting in it; she\npulled away from it, preferring to see God materialized in the tangible form\nof Krishna. God is both finite and infinite. In creation the finite aspect of God\nis emphasized. But pure Spirit, in which creation is dissolved in Him, reflects\nInfinitude. Some devotees like the finite expression of God, whereas others\nprefer the infinite aspect of the Divine. Mother Jasoda loved and found God in\nher son, Krishna. God fulfills all the worthy desires of devotees, as the earth-\nly mother satisfies the wholesome desires of her children.\n\nAFFIRMATION I shall drink the everlasting nectar of joy found in the @\nfountain of meditation.\n"}

We are living in a new\nage. Standards of living are changing. The scientific way to live is to go within\nyourself and ask yourself whether you are doing right or wrong, and be absolutely\nsincere with yourself. If you are sincere with yourself, you are unlikely ever to\ngo wrong; and even if you do, you will be able quickly to correct yourself.\n\nBe master of yourself! You must remain in the safety of your castle of\nreason. If you know how to destroy delusion by the power of your mind, you will\nnot become its victim. Above all, be true to yourself. The old orthodox way is\nto deny temptation, to suppress it. But you must learn to control that temptation.\nIt is not a sin to be tempted. Even though you are boiling with temptation, you\nare not evil; but if you yield to that temptation, you are caught temporarily by\nthe power of evil. You must erect about yourself protecting parapets of wisdom.\nThere is no stronger force that you can employ against temptation than wisdom.\nComplete understanding will bring you to the point where nothing can tempt you\nto actions that promise pleasure but in the end will only hurt you.\n\nLAW OF ACTION All human events are rooted in the law of cause and effect.\n\nThere is nothing called {2४९ . !' From the effects of all\nactions we can trace a cause. In this life you are the architect of your own des-\ntiny. No matter how terrible life is, owing to the effects of past wrong actions,\nit is never too late to change the future, for you are your own savior.\n\nYou think you are free, but you are not really free until you have liberated\nyourself from the effects of past and present actions. When you understand the\nlaw of cause and effect, you can see clearly a just reason for all the conditions\nof life that may now appear to you unjust.\n\nPast actions are not only those that you were performing a few minutes, days,\nor years ago, but include actions of your past lives as well. Would we not con-\nsider God very unjust if He gave to one person the brain of a moron and to another\na brain of high intelligence? God is not partial.

If you con-\nsume the seeds in the fire of wisdom, they cannot sprout into future effects, and\nyou will become a free individual. You cannot be free until you have burned\nthose seeds of action in the fire of wisdom and meditation. You should not allow\nyour actions to be wrongly influenced by custom or environment. You should\nstay away from evil because it is harmful. You should use your wisdom and\nintelligence to choose the ८ anpany and the environment that will contribute to\nyour highest good and happiness, and to resist evil customs or environment if\nyou cannot immediately better conditions.\n\nGUARD AGAINST EVIL Do not get into the power of evil; you can avoid it by\n\n। not forming bad habits. If you form bad habits, evil\nhas already won the battle, and it may be a long time before you will awaken\n= delusion. Satan is working his way into your life through diseases, men-\ntal sorrows, and satiety. When boredom fills your mind, you lose sight of all\nhappiness. The best way to escape is to convince yourself that you are nota\nsinner, but a child of God. You have been a victim of Satan, and you must try\nto correct yourself.\n\nDestroy all darkness by light, evil thoughts by good thoughts, and temptation\nby meditation. Any time you feel that something is overpowering you, meditate.\n“Phat is the best cure. If you aré always kind, darkness will fly. If you have ©\nmade up your mind to be good, then you are no longer a sinner, even though\nyou fail occasionally. You are simply sleeping in ignorance, and you are imag-\nining that you are suffering from poverty, illness, and so on.\n\nYou must always remember that you lead yourself into temptation. True\n\nreason will always show you that you are doing wrong, if you consult it. When\nyour reason and will act, then you will become powerful against temptation.\nYour will power must never become impotent. Do not let anyone control you.\nYou must be able to resist. On the other hand, you must never be stubborn\n\nwhen you should be reasonable.\n\nCONTACT DIVINE SPIRIT First make your contact with the Divine. Satan's\nmethod of temptation is to delude you into feeling\nthe little joy of material things and to not let you feel the higher joy of Spirit.\nGod is the only real possession to have because He is happiness everlasting. We\nshould want God because He is the panacea for all our suffering. He is the\nanswer to all our needs. The very thing that our hearts cry for--love, wisdom,\neve rything--we find in contact with that Complete One. After all, even if you\nare the most famous man in the world, when you die that will be the end here,\nand you will not remember that people adored you. Only the great ones such\nas Krishna or Christ know, because they are omnipresent and conscious. Why\n| । try to have something that you will lose just as you cross the threshold of the\ngrave?\n\n"}

Then he reasons: ''Why can't I enjoy\nmaterial and spiritual pleasures together?\" not wanting to face the fact that this\nonly amounts to wanting to enjoy a poisonous drink and an invigorating tonic at\nthe same time.

Every grape seemed to hold the fragrance and warmth of\nthe sunny valley where they were grown, and their taste was as tempting as that\nof wine. As he fondled and savored and slowly ate the grapes, the Alaskan\nwished that they might last forever. He became so enamored of them that he\ncould think of nothing but reaching the country where they are grown. He disposed\nof his holdings in the north and, through the kindness of the friend who had sent\nthe grapes, secured a job at Fresno where all kinds of grapes grow abundantly.\n\nOn his arrival, the Alaskan was. invited to the home of his friend; and soon\na young lady, who had been told of his predilection for grapes, brought him a\nlarge bunch of his favorite variety.

Still,\nwhen he saw the contents of the basket, he was at once wide awake and filled\nwith joy at the prospect of feasting at will on all the beautiful bunches of fruit\nthis kind acquaintance had brought. ''Oh, how wonderful to have so many grapes:\n\nThank you so much!\"'\n\nWhen his benefactor had left he tasted a few grapes, although in his mouth\nstill lingered the taste of grapes now fermenting in his stomach.

He greeted\nboth the lady and the grapes with just slightly wilted enthusiasm.\n\nOn the fourth morning the vineyard-owner appeared, laden as usual with\ngrapes.

Teach us\nto love Thee above everything, as we cannot live or love anything without\n\nThy life, Thy love.\nKK\n\nTHE LIFE OF A YOGI VERSUS A BUSINESS LIFE\n\nMost people reason that if they first acquire prosperity, they can then\nthink of God. But we must have God first, because He is our greatest need.\nOnce that consciousness of His presence comes, we shall have real happiness.\nGod must be with us always. If but once we achieve that incomparable contact\nwith God, the universe will be at our feet. It is an absolute truth. We should\nnot forget that God is our provider. It isn't what we own, but what we can ac-\nquire at will that denotes real prosperity.\n\nTo live unspiritually is to live a contradictory life. When our whole con-\nsciousness, no matter what our faults are, is yearning and striving toward\nGod, toward the silence, that is being with God. When we perform all the\nduties of life cheerfully, without letting concern for duties upset our inner hap-\npiness, we are experiencing spiritual happiness. Our whole mind and conscious-\nness are going back toward the Source--toward God. Freedom, happiness, and\nplain living are the most desirable necessities of life, so the masters of India\nteach. That is why the masters give the training of plain living and high think-\ning to students from the beginning of their novitiate.\n\nWe are living directly by the power of God. We are supplied with life\nforce and sun and air and food directly by God. Suppose He suddenly changed\nthe climate of earth and made it intolerably extreme. What then? Where\nwould be the food? How would we live? Why not remember that God is the\nsupporter of the life that He gave tous? Even though He made that life depend-\nent upon food, still He is the support behind the food and all other outer neces-\nsities. He is the Cause of everything, and when we lose our connection with\nHim we are bound to suffer.\n\nIt is His lightning splendor that is borrowed by the lightning. All lights\nlose their luminosity before the glory of His light. All beautiful things exist\nbecause of God. Because God is, all things of beauty are beautiful.\n\nTo forget God and live buried in luxury is heathenish. Yogis have learned\nthat God can never be found outside, but that when we go deep within the soul,\nin the temple of God, we can say: ''No one in the whole world cares for my\nhealth, prosperity, and happiness as my Heavenly Father does. He is with me\nalways. Having little material wealth, I yet have everything, for I have God.\"\n\n"}

The yogi says: 'Be free within. Take God as your provider\nand live no more in poverty consciousness. \"'\n\nReal prosperity, and real freedom are attained when we realize that God\nis our provider, and that we are absolutely dependent upon Him. When we\nhave that consciousness, we need not care what happens externally, because\nwe are in the immortal arms of God. Isn't that better than to live unhappily\nwithout God, suffering from poverty? Jesus was not wealthy. Yet he was the\nhappiest person in the world. He had God, and he knew that God was the pro-\nvider.\n\nRiches of the world are perishable, but the riches of God are imperishable.\nA million times a man tortures his soul with earthly incarnations, and the only\nway that he can find release is to find God.

There is no difficulty that cannot be solved provided you believe\nthat you have more power than troubles. You must use that power to explode\nyour difficulties. Very few people try to succeed scientifically. We often hear\nsomeone say: ''Iam lucky,\" or, \"it is fate;'' but there is no luck or good for-\ntune that you did not attract to yourself in the past, and there is no misfortune\nthat has not come through wrong actions here in the present, or else way back\nin the past. That is why some people are born poor and some healthy, rich,\nand soon. Otherwise, if God made us His children, all equal, and then put\nsome in good homes and others in bad homes, where would be His justice?\nRemember, the greatest of all things is to please God first. If the whole world\nis pleased with you and God is not pleased, you have nothing; but if the whole\nworld forsakes you and God is pleased with you, then you have everything.\n\nWe are absolutely dependent for life itself upon God's laws, and He will\n\nshow us the way out of all our difficulties.

If we can reach that state wherein we can say:\n\"What is mine is yours, '' this world will be much better. In this age of selfish-\nness it is extremely difficult to be prosperous. Selfishness must go. It can\nbe destroyed only by everyone's being unselfish.

Most\npeople cannot maintain a balance between the material and the spiritual life.\nThe spiritual man needs money and the material man cannot live happily with-\nout God. The spiritual man works with the consciousness that God is the Doer.\nThe material man works too, but he works and acts with the consciousness that\nhe is the doer, and as such he makes himself miserable through his likes and\ndislikes.\n\nAll business activities, whether for spiritual or material purposes, should\nbe based upon true business principles, employed with discrimination. With-\nout that sense of proportion, everything we do tends to produce misery instead\nof happiness. If a man invites a crowd of poor people to a festivity, and doesnt\nhave the money to buy food for them, that is lack of discrimination, lack of\nbalance in planning. We must understand the law of order which governs our\nactions. It is wrong to use religion for promoting business, although it is good\nto use business methods in furthering religion. There is a universal law of\nhappiness that works. If we follow that law, happiness and prosperity are\nbound to come.\n\nWhen business principles are not based upon truth, they are bound to bring\nmisery and suffering. In business principles there is sometimes a great error\nof untruth, since some business methods are based upon selfishness and on\nmaking people matter-bound through sense-attraction.\n\nMan should purge his consciousness of the selfishness of material luxury.-\nHe should enjoy more luxury in his soul, and so decorate himself with the\nknowledge and wisdom and love of God. We should learn to live simply, and\nby one common principle: looking out for one another's good. That unity of\npurpose can never come if there is selfishness in individual hearts.\n\nThe one-sided businessman who is forgetful of his other duties of life, is\nnot a truly successful man. It requires greater skill to live life evenly, right-\nly, and successfully. He who only keeps his engagement with money is left\nbehind by God. It is true that God has given us the pangs of hunger, so that\nwe get busy and make money to support our physical bodies. Yet it seems\nthat just maintaining our physical bodies is not the goal of life. There is little\ndifference between eating food from a gold plate and from atin plate.

During his reign, Hinduism and Mohammedanism flourished side by\nside in complete harmony. Akbar sometimes dressed as a Mohammedan and\nwent into a mosque to pray, and at other times he might dress.as a Hindu and\nworship in a Hindutemple.

Heralds and bodyguards would\ntrumpet his approach in all quarters of the city. In spite of this great pomp\nand splendor it was Akbar's strict order that the procession be stopped at any\ntime, anywhere, if any of his subjects wanted to offer him a petition.\n\nOne day, as the royal procession passed along the boulevard, the emper-\nor's attention was attracted by two blind men, sitting about twenty yards apart,\nshouting for alms. He ordered the carriage stopped in front of the first one,\nwho kept repeating: ''To whom the emperor gives, he alone can be rich, नि\nAfter listening thoughtfully, Akbar ordered his carriage moved forward in\nfront of the second blind'‘man, whose cry was: ''To whom God gives, he alone\n\ncan be rich. '\n\nFor a month, whenever his procession passed along the boulevard, the\ngreat ruler heard the two blind men shouting their respective demands for rich-\nes from him and riches from God. At last, feeling quite flattered by the first\nblind man's utterance, ''To whom the emperor gives, he alone can be rich, \"'\nAkbar ordered one day that a very large loaf of bread be baked, and that the inside\nbe stuffed with solid gold. This loaf Akbar gave to the first blind man. The\nemperor completely ignored the second blind man, who cried that God alone\ncould make him rich. |\n\nSoon after, Akbar went on a hunting trip. When 16 returned and once again\npassed along the boulevard in his usual way, he came across the blind man to\nwhom he had given the loaf. The beggar was still shouting: ''To whom the em-\nperor gives, he alone becomes rich.'' Then Akbar had the royal coach stopped,\nand he leaned out and asked: ''What did you do with the loaf I gave 90०0५?\" The\nman replied: ''Your Royal Highness, the loaf you gave me was too large and\nnot well baked, for it was very heavy; so 1 sold it to the other blind man for ten\ncents. Iwas happy to get even that much money.'' Akbar looked about for the\nsecond blind man but he was nowhere to be seen. Upon inquiry, Akbar learned\nthat the other blind man had given the loaf to his wife, who had opened it and\nfound the gold. With this they had bought a home. When he heard this, the\nemperor at once realized the lesson implied. With inner humbleness, but with\nan outward show of wrath, he rebuked the first blind man, saying: 'You fool,\nyou gave away my gold-stuffed loaf to your friend who depended upon God and\nnot upon me for wealth. From now on you must use his motto: ''To whom God\ngives, he alone can be rich.\"\n\nThe moral of this story of the two blind men is certainly applicable today!\nMillions of people think that all wealth comes from the banks, factories, and\njobs, and through personal ability. Yet periodic great depressions prove that\nthere are divine laws, aside from known physical laws, that govern the physi-\ncal, mental, spiritual, and material phases of life.

Tell the evil per-\nson to be good and the restless person to be meditative, and they will make\nyou feel that they do not like to follow your instructions, or that they cannot\ndo so. This is due to previous habits and not to the desire of the heart. Hence,\nnever put aside good habits; cultivate them, and develop the taste for their su-\nperior, lasting happiness. You love the outward pleasures of the senses be-\ncause you happened to be held up by them at first, and then you remained their\nprisoner. Evenas some persons get used to jail, so we mortals like outer\npleasures, shutting off the joys from within.\n\nEnvironment and the company you keep are of paramount importance. The\nspecific outer environment of early life is specially important in stimulating\nor stifling the inner instinctive environment or tendencies of a child. How-\never, there is no period in life when environment and good company are not\nimportant.\n\nIt must be remembered that the inner mental environment, or state, of\nan individual is what God judges by. One may be a sinner at heart while living\nin the company of saints, or he may be a saint although in the company of\ntransgressors. But to evolve toa saintly state while clinging to evil compan-\nions would be most difficult. It is most important to know that sinners or\nsaints are largely made through the company they keep. If a sinner is willing\nto mend his ways and lives in the company of saints, he is bound to change,\nwhile a careless spiritual man will deteriorate in the company of wicked peo-\nple. Through reaction to our outer environment, from early childhood on,\nour inner mental environment is formed. This inner mental environment of\nthought and mental habits, plus tendencies formed inthe past, almost auto-\nmatically guides our actions.\n\nNow let us consider mental resurrection, the upliftment of the conscious-\nness from identification with the body. In the beginning of each life, the soul\nstarts out to enjoy manifesting through the body and ends by becoming the\nslave of the body. We must learn to live life above the physical plane. Men-\ntal development is the by-product of physical development; so we find, accord-\ning to natural evolution, that the soul first resurrects itself to the plane of\nthe intellect or the plane of prosperity, and then rises to the plane of spiritual\n\n"}

Intellectual attainments are undoubtedly helpful. Through\nthem gradually we understand the way to resurrect the body into the Spirit.\n\nYou know that the silkworm weaves threads around itself ina cocoon, and\nbefore it slips out of the cocoon as a butterfly, the silkman gets hold of it,\nand the butterfly finds its death in the silken prison created by itself. Wedo\nmuch the same thing. Before the wings of Spirituality grow, we weave threads\nof fear, worry, and ignorance around ourselves until disease and death come\nto destroy us. We find ourselves in bondage created by ourselves. What\nbrings this destruction? Our own thoughts, our own wrong ways of living--\nacting first, without thinking. We must resurrect ourselves from thoughts of\nanger, from thoughts of selfishness, from the clamor of inharmonious living.\n\nPure love, sacred ever-new <= poetic imagination, kindness, wisdom,\npeace, bliss in meditation, and happiness in serving are felt inwardly, first\nin the mind or the heart; then they are transmitted through the nervous sys-\ntem to the physical body and are manifested outwardly. Do not camouflage\nyour soul with the veil of sermons and solemn words. Understand and feel\nthe superior joys of the inner life, and you will prefer them to the fleeting\npleasures of the outer world.\n\nTROUBLES--RESULT OF PAST ACTIONS\n\nEnvironmental troubles are born because of your conscious or unconscious\nactions in the past, somewhere, sometime. You must blame yourself for that.\nHowever, you must not develop an inferiority complex. Trials do not cometo\ndestroy you, but that you may appreciate God more and learn to follow His\nlaws so that you will find real happiness. God does not send those trials, they\nare born of your own making. All you have to do is to resurrect your con-\nsciousness from the environment of ignorance.\n\nFor the most part, the senses promise us a little temporary happiness,\nbut give us long, lasting sorrow in the end. Whereas, virtue and happiness\nwithin do not promise much, but in the end always give lasting satisfaction.\nThat is why I call the lasting inner happiness of the soul joy and the imperma-\nnent sense thrills pleasure.\n\nIf a bad habit bothers you, do two things.\n1) Negatively try to avoid everything that occasioned it or\n\nstimulated it, without concentrating on it in the zeal to concentrating on it in the zeal to\n\navoid it.\n\n2) Then positively try to divert your mind to some good habit,\nand keep it furiously engaged in culturing that desirable\ntrait until it becomes a part of yourself.\n\n"}

They do not blame @\nothers for troubles that can usually be traced to their own actions and lack of\nunderstanding. They know that no one has any power to add to their happiness\nor detract from it unless they themselves are so weak that they allow the ad-\nverse thoughts and wicked actions of others to affect them. Stagnant people\nare unhappy. Extremely ignorant people scarcely know how it feels to either\nbe happy or unhappy. They are unfeeling, like the stones. It is better to be\nunhappy about your own ignorance than to die happily with it. Wherever you\nare, remain awake and alive with your thought, perception, and intuition,\never ready, like a good photographer, to take pictures of exemplary conduct\nand to ignore bad behavior. Your highest happiness lies in your being ever\nready in desiring to learn, and to behave properly. The more you improve\nyourself, the more you will elevate others around you. The self-improving\nman is the increasingly happy man. The happier you become, the happier\nwill be the people around you.\n\nWATCH YOUR PROGRESS Very few people analyze their situation to de-\n\ntermine whether they are progressing or going\nbackward in life. As human beings endowed with reason, wisdom, and under-\nstanding, it is our greatest duty to use our reason and wisdom rightly so that\nwe may know whether we are going backward or forward. If failures invade\nyour life repeatedly, don't get discouraged. They should act as stimulants\nand not poisons to your material and spiritual growth. The period of failure\nis the best season for sowing the seeds of success. Weed out the causes of\nfailure and cultivate with double vigor the field in which you want to accom-\nplish something worthwhile. Death in the attempt to succeed is success; re-\nfuse to harbor the consciousness of defeat. Always try once more, no mat-\nter how many times you have failed. Fight when you think that you can fight\nno more, or when you think that you have fought your best. Every new effort\nafter a failure must be well planned and charged with increasing intensity of\nattention. Begin from today to try to do--one at a time--the things you thought\nimpossible for you to do.\n\nBALANCE YOUR ACTIVITIES Try to harmonize monetary craving with\n\nspiritual Ts Let neither rule the\nother. Don't think that you are too spiritual to wish for material success.\nDon't be so busy with material duties that you have no time for meditation,\nSpiritual study, service, and so forth. One who is chronically unsuccessful\nin material life has not learned all its lessons. The spiritually selfish man,\nignoring material life, is punished with loss of mental balance. All material\nwork is service to your fellow being, if done in the right spirit, and is there-\nfore worthwhile. Don't be one-sided. Lead a scheduled life and grade your\nduties. Duty should consist of work which you do with pleasure and a sense\nof privilege, and not with the feeling of paying a debt which is due. Conscious-\nness of spiritual and moral duty should reign predominantly in your mind,\nabove all other duties.\n\nYou have talent and power that you have not used. You have all the power\n\n"}

Resurrect\nyour mind from the little habits that keep you worldly all the time. Smile\n\nthat perpetual smile of balanced recklessness--that million-dollar smile that\nno one can take from you.\n\nTHOUGHTS TO REMEMBER Tne influence of stars upon human iives is\nowing to the interrelated forces of attraction\nand repulsion of planets and human bodies. First, the evil thought in an indi-\nvidual leads him to an evil environment to express himself in a like manner.\nThen again, by another free act of will, he can change his mind and conse-\nquently change his evil environment. But when one constantly remains men-\ntally in an evil environment, that environment begins to strongly affect him\nand to exert an almost unconscious influence upon him, and in time he almost\nentirely loses his freedom to choose a different environment or the power to\nbecome free from the resented, undesirable influence of the specific evil en-\n\nvironment.\n\nThe man of infinite power, tuned in with God. does not wait for the planets\nto smile; he marches on, influenced only by the Sun of all suns, the Almighty\nSpirit. When aman has faith, or a proper depth of determination, he can\nmove mountains, and planets wait at his beck and call to do what he commands\nthem todo. The man of realization and determination finds a new heaven with\n- @ ———-Spirit-esthe-only environment: _He-sees neo-seeds-of- difficulties latent within\nhim, for he burnt them by the fire of wisdom. He sees that he acts, moves,\nand sleeps under the one influence of a new heaven or God. He consults God\ninstead of the stars for guidance.\n\nSPIRITUALIZING BEFORE BIRTH\n\nSwami Shankara was the reorganizer of the Swami Order, the ancient Order\nof Renunciation. His life was marked by many singular happenings. It is said\nthat he reached his spiritual attainment and established his life philosophy as\nwell at the age of thirty years, when he made the transition into Infinitude.\n\nThis uncommon achievement on the part of Swami Shankara was due to the\nfact that when he was in the embryonic state his soul received high scriptural\neducation, administered through the subconscious mind of his mother.\n\nSwami Shankara's father was an extraordinary yogi. He tuned his wis-\ndom to the subconsciousness of his wife for some time before baby Shankara\nwas born. And the mother tuned her consciousness to that of the sleeping\nembryonic Shankara. In this way the realization of the truths acquired by\nSwami Shankara's father were automatically transferred to the unborn Shankara\nthrough the medium of the subconsciousness and superconsciousness of his\n\n@ mother.

Like the boy Jesus, who deliv- @\nered sermons to the wise men in Jerusalem, the divine lad Shankara started\n\nimparting his wisdom to others at a very early age\n\nThe subconscious mind never sleeps. It is alert day and night, ready to\nmemorize all important experiences through the phenomenon of memory. All\nstudents of Self-realization should therefore remember that even the environ-\nment in which they sleep, as that in which they live, directly or indirectly\naffects them. If they live with drunkards or dissipated people, they will un-\nconsciously assume their traits, and mental lassitude will creep over them.\nIt is desirable to sleep in a house with harmonious, good people, as one will\nthus attract their good characteristics during one's sleep state. That is one\nway of becoming worthy and noble without much effort of will power. In the\n\nwakeful, conscious state, people learn from, and absorb the vibrations of the\nspecific company they contact, through their imagination and conscious will,\nas well as through their subconscious mind. This is why a baby helplessly\nmanifests the characteristics of his environment. If an American baby is\nbrought up in an Oriental environment, he will act like an Oriental; similarly,\nif an Oriental baby is brought up in an American environment, he will act like\nan American. Parents should also remember that their mental attitudes and\nspiritual development can make it possible for spiritual children to be born\nto them. Each mother carrying a child should remember that her particular\ngood or bad nature, her salutary or ignoble thoughts, and her actions toward\nher family and others, will greatly influence the nature of her baby.\n\nIf modern scientific breeding can produce fine animals to order, why then\ncannot proper human beings be made to order? Many parents are responsible\nfor burdening the earth with misery by ignorantly producing criminal children.\nInstead, spiritually developed parents could save the world and make it heaven-\nly by creating spiritual children and by living a life of moderation, self-\ndiscipline, and meditation.\n\nsk Hook\nAFFIRMATION\nHaving Thee, O God, as the deepest joy of\ndeepest meditation, I know that all rane\n\nprosperity, health, and wisdom--will befadded\nunto me.\n\n"}

Teach me to perform every work just to please Thee.\n\nKK\nHOW TO SEEK GOD, AND WHY--Part 1\n\nThe vaguest of all conceptions is the human idea of God. Man's research-\nes about food, finance, health, and human relationships are quite extensive\nand definite. But do you realize how easily you are satisfied with untested\nconcepts of God? You see a little work of God in nature, you hear people talk\nabout God, you read the scriptures about Him, but did you ever set out with\na definite aim or intention actually to verify your beliefs about God, or to find\nout for yourself what God is?\n\nSome people wonder who made God. The question is born of ignorance,\nand this short dialogue shows why. AnArabian once met a Hindu. The\nArabian, who lived mostly on dates, asked the Hindu if dates grow in India.\n\"No,' replied the Hindu. ''Well,'' queried the astonished Arabian, \"how do\nyou Hindus live?\"\n\nSo, we reason according to our own mentality. We ourselves are results\nof causation; therefore we think all things are froma cause. But that isn't so.\nGod is causeless. In Him there is no cause and effect. He is like the ocean.\nThe ocean may have a storm whipping up waves upon its surface, but the\nocean is not created by the storm. Nor can the waves say: ''We were created\nby the storm, therefore the ocean is made by the storm.\"\n\nSuppose there is a jar of salt water in the ocean and the opening is corked.\nIf you take the stopper out, the salt water inside the jar will become one with\nthe salt water of the ocean. Similarly, a human being lives in the ocean of\nCosmic Consciousness, but he does not know God. A portion of God is locked\nup in the jar of flesh and closed by the stopper of ignorance. In this manner\nwe are moving in God without being aware of Him.\n\nWhen nothing else was, Spirit was. What is Spirit? It is ever-existing,\never-conscious, ever-new joy. When Spirit began to create, it became three:\n\n1) the consciousness of God beyond creation, which is\n\"God the Father\";\n\n2) the consciousness of God in creation, which is Christ\nConsciousness; and\n\n"}

But how do\nmost people use this priceless machine? Asa rule, it wakes up in the morn-\ning, eats breakfast, goes to work, goes to lunch, then goes back to the office,\ncomes home, has dinner then perhaps goes to the movies; then it goes to\nsleep, to wake up next morning and do the same thing all over again, day in\nand day out.\n\nWe are controlled by radio-active and vito-active energies unleashed by\nGod. Just as ships may be moved by remote-control radio, so our beings\nare motivated and controlled by the Infinite Spirit which is present every-\nwhere. But the point 18 this: Just as the sunlight falling on the water ina\ncup which I keep moving becomes divided by reflection into a million suns, so\nSpirit is reflected in each human body and mind as individualized Spirit, or\nsoul. Although this soul is a reflection of Spirit, it is identified with the body.\nHence it is trying very hard, through processes of evolution, to free itself\nfrom the cage of the body and return to the Infinite Spirit.\n\neo ae क held-a cup filled with water under a lamp, at the same time causing” ~~\nthe water to move inthe cup, I would have a distorted reflection of the light\nin the cup, and that reflection is not the real light; but if you could not see the\nlamp you might be deluded into thinking that the distorted image or light in the\ncup is real. Resurrection signifies taking the reflected soul image away from\nthe moving cup of restless consciousness, and reuniting it with the original\nall-pervading, undistorted light.\n\nThe soul is reflected from Spirit in the body, and it is caged in the body,\nso the soul seems to have all the limitations of the body and of the mind; there-\nfore we must resurrect the soul from the thraldom of the body and the mind\nand reunite it with the Spirit. ।\n\nThought is infinite. Every word represents an ideal conception of the\nInfinite, because behind every word and thought there is a manifestation of\nthe Infinite. Many waves of thought are dancing in the waves of consciousness,\nbut behind that there is the great unceasing ocean of truth. Our expressions\nare waves of the ocean of understanding.\n\nWe say that God is invisible to us, but in reality He is visible in the\nmighty manifested universe. God is everything--not just one thing. One\nwave is not the whole ocean--the ocean and the waves together constitute the\n\n@ ocean. Thus all manifested things and the unmanifested pure Cosmic Con-\nsciousness constitute Spirit.\n"}

Don't seek the recogni-\ntion of man in the spiritual path; seek the recognition of God. Whom God pro-\ntects, nothing can destroy; but if He is displeased, although every one else is\npleased, their approbation is worthless. Your first duty is to please God.\n\nWhy should you give your time, your energy, to the world and to worldly\npursuits when the world will not be responsible for the effects of your actions,\nnor will it stand by you when you get into trouble? You alone will suffer. Do\nyou realize that you are alone and friendless in the world if you cut off God,\nand that you are ungrateful if you completely forget Him who is with you al-\nways whether you know it or not? He came with you in the beginning; He has\nbeen with you all the time; and He alone will be with you when you take the\nnext step in your evolution. Make peace with Him now. No duty is more im-\nportant than your duty to God, for no duty is performed without God's power.\n\nDo not let your environment and temptations control you. A virtuous,\nspiritual life is far more charming than indulgence in material temptation, but\nthe trouble is that the precedence of sensuous experience and the constant\npresence of this temptation controls people. From the beginning of life on\nearth one is subjected to material temptations, and becomes accustomed to\nthem long before being attracted by the spiritual way of life. But if God once\ntempts you with His love, nothing else can ever tempt you away from Him.\n\nThe five senses are very dangerous because they are always making us\ninvestigate those things which are not good for us. God has given us the senses\nthrough which we apprehend the various aspects of matter;.and because we\ndwell on the sensations produced by those senses, we like things that taste\ngood, feel good, or smell good, but that is only a habit. Many people develop\nmaterial habits because they have no sense of comparison; they cannot com-\npare sense joy with the joy of the soul because they have not experienced soul\njoy. There is no chance to compare until one has renounced all pleasure of\nthe senses and found a greater joy. The only way to avoid being trapped by\nworldly temptation is to know that there are higher things than temptation.\n\nWhen temptation comes, you must first stop the action or force, and then\nreason. If you try to reason first, the temptation will often compel you to do\nthe thing that you should not do. Stop the force, and then reason, after that\n\n"}

Don't say,\n‘I should not do this because...'' Just say, ''No!\"' and leave the place, or turn\nyour attention elsewhere, as the case may be. That is the surest way to de-\nfeat temptation. The more you develop this ''won't'' power during the advent\nof temptation, the happier you will be, because all happiness depends upon\nthe ability to do those things that you should do.\n\nA bad habit sits octopus-like in the brain and commands you to do a cer-\ntain thing. You don't want to do that thing and yet you do it. So never let\nyourself reach a point where you become a victim of wrong habits. No matter\nwhat you do, remember that you must be the governor of yourself--since you\ntake the consequences. Do not let anything or anyone run you. Remember,\nif any undesirable thought or act becomes a habit with you, it is time to stop\nthat thing. Asa rule, Ido not like commandments: Whenever you command\nsomeone not to do a certain thing, that person seems determined to do it. So\nIonly suggest that you command yourself. The taste of forbidden fruit is\nsweet in the beginning, but bitter in the end. You should be very careful not\nto let anything interfere with your ultimate happiness.\n\nGOD SPEAKS Through meditation you come in contact with your real\nTHROUGH Self and you forget what you imagine that you are. You\nMEDITATION have been in a state of hallucination, thinking that you are\n\na mortal, struggling and suffering. Every day you should\n\n“give attention to your true status. Sit quietly and say: 'I am not the earth, `\n\nnor the sky; no birth nor death have I; father, mother, have I none; I am in-\nfinite happiness. '' If you repeat this often, and think about it day and night,\nthen you will realize what you really are. Only those who meditate realize\n\nthat behind the superconscious mind there is a land of eternal happiness.\n\nThe more you feel peace in meditation, the closer you are to God. He\nmoves nearer and nearer to youthe deeper you enter into meditation. The\npeace of meditation is the language and embracing comfort of God. There-\nfore, God is present right on the throne of peace within you. Find Him there\nfirst and you will find Him in all the noble pursuits of life, in true friends, in\nthe beauty of nature, in good books, in good thoughts, in noble aspirations.\nFinding peace within you, you will know that whatever in life gives you lasting\npeace, is declaring to you the presence of God without as well as within. When\nyou know God as peace within, then you will realize Him as peace existing in\nthe universal harmony of all things without.\n\nStop watching the little toy-show of this world. Close your eyes and\nplunge behind the screen of inner darkness. By deeper effort of meditation,\ntear the veil of darkness. Lift the veil of silence and hear the magical, sooth-\ning, tolling music of planets--behold the fiery light of multi-trillion colored\ndancing atoms.

One of his customers was the village priest. a\nfellow almost as slippery as the fisherman's daily catch. The priest continu-\nally charged the fish he bought, but was always very difficult to find when the\nfisherman tried to collect his bill. The unpaid debts of the priest eventually\nbecame very large and the fisherman, after a long search, at last found and\n\n- @ accosted the priest with this-proposal: ----- ---- Ti tia ~----- ------\n\n“Your Holiness, why do you avoid me? If you would only teach me a meth-\nod of walking on the water, so that I can go freely to the places where large\nschools of fish are known to swim, and it is easy to net them, I will present\n\nyou with a large fish free of charge and I will cancel your debt to me. \"\n\nThe disbelieving priest had only one thought, to get rid of the fisherman,\nwho he thought must be crazy. So the priest whispered into the attentive ear\nof the faithful fisherman: ''Son, all you have to do is to write three times on\nthe surface of your palm the sacred word Om. Then you will be able to walk\nover the Ganges to whatever spot you wish to catch fish. \"'\n\nSome days passed before the fisherman was again able to intercept the\npriest, who continually dodged the encounter. The fisherman finally succeed-\ned, however, and, proffering a large, choice fish tothe priest, he said: \"I\nhave been trying to get hold of you in order to give you some fish and cancel\nyour debt tome. Everything came through your grace, as you said it would.\"\n\nAstonished, the skeptical priest looked at the large fish the fisherman\nwas holding and cried, ‘'How did you get such a fine big 1787?

''\n\nThereupon the fisherman wrote the sacred word Om on the palm of each\nhand of the priest. Then casually, nonchalantly, in utmost divine faith, the\nfisherman took the priest by the hand and began to walk swiftly over the water\nof the holy Ganges. And lo, the priest was walking over the water also. But\nin a little while the skeptical priest began to fear getting his cloak wet, and\nthen came the thought of drowning. He began at once to sink, and cried out,\n'\"Fisherman,:-l am drowning!\"\n\n“Well, Your Holiness, you can't walk on the water and at the same time\nentertain fear of drowning or worry about your cloth's being drenched. Look\nat me and see how I walk on the water with complete faith. '' So saying, the\nfisherman led the trembling priest back to shore and left him to meditate on\nhis weakness and lack of faith in God.\n\n‘Jesus said: ''If thou dost believe and say unto this mountain, 'go into\nthe depths of the sea,’ it shall 280. '' But do not expect the mountain to obey if\nyou goto it and say with a timid, unbelieving, squeaky voice: ''Mr. Mountain,\nwill you please go into the depths of the sea? I don't really believe it possible,\n\nIam just saying what Jesus said. '' | ।\n\nMiracles are simply the working of universal super-laws and they can be\nperformed ordinarily, in a common way, when one is acquainted with the\nscientific relation between matter and mind. Jesus walked on the waters and\nsaved the skeptical, drowning Peter.\n\nBut remember, do not try to do difficult things unless you know the real\nmethod of working the miracles of faith and will power. Do not try to walk on\nwater when your spiritual consciousness is relatively undeveloped. Develop\nyour faith first and try to work it to solve small difficulties. Then you will -\nbe able to open the Gordian knots of the most abstruse problems of life.\n\nThis story shows that you must know the appropriate spiritual technique\nas well as have absolute faith and abandonment in God if you aspire to work\nHis miracles; and-that if you are skeptical and nevertheless try to perform\ngreat miracles you may be beset by severe difficulties.\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nWith the love of all saints, I will. love Thee.

When tigers of worries, sickness, and\ndeath are chasing you, your only sanctuary is the inner temple of si-\nlence. The spiritually deep man lives day and night in a calm interior\nSilence into which neither menacing worries nor even the crash of col-\nliding worlds can intrude. Those who enter that temple of silence are\nable to commune with other God-bent souls; they comprehend the conversa-\ntion of flowers and of all living creatures.\n\nThe more you are silent the more happiness you will find. What joy\nawaits discovery in the silence behind the portals of your mind, no\nhuman tongue can tell. But you must convince yourself; you must medi-\ntate and create that environment. Those who deeply meditate feel a\nwonderful inner quiet. This stillness within should be maintained even\nwhen in the company of other people. What you learn in meditation,\npractice in activity and conversation; let no one dislodge you from that\ncalm state. Hold on to your peace.\n\nWhen you meet people, do not become affected by their state of\nconsciousness. Be one with those who are ever singing of God; remain\naloof from those who reveal undesirable qualities. Be with people in\nsilence; don’t spend precious time and energy in idle talk. Eat in\nSilence; work in silence. God loves silence. Even when death comes,\nmaintain your silence in communion with Him; depart from the body say-\ning, \"I am a king of immortality, sitting on the throne of silence.\"\n\nIn your inner temple of silence receive God with your awakened\nintuition; you want to touch Him with devotion and place Him on the\naltar of your superconscious bliss. You meet God first on the altar of\ncalmness, a negative aspect of His presence; but when you go deeper, in\nsamadhi-oneness you will meet God on the altar of His omnipresent bliss.\n\nFeel that in the temple of silence you are coaxing God to come, that\nyou yearn to meet Him, to touch Him in devotion, and to keep Him there\non the altar of your peace. Then go deeper and enter the temple of\nsamadhi, the highest oneness with Him.\n\n"}

By the penetrating heat of intuition, engendered when\nconcentrating upon the spiritual eye, each human soul-chick can bore a\nhole in the roof of the space shell and through that slip out into the\nvast Infinite.\n\nA person in a lighted room whose windows are shuttered may enjoy the\nbeautiful furnishings of the room, but can see nothing beyond unless he\nopens the shutters and looks out. Similarly, we live in a sunlit deco-\nrated hall of earth, but we cannot behold the territory of the Infinite\nunless we open the window of the spiritual eye.\n\nThe human eye changes its position and angle of vision according to\nour changing thoughts. In sleep, eyelids are closed and the eyeballs\nare comparatively still. In wakefulness the eyelids are constantly\nwinking and the eyeballs are continually in motion. In the supercon-\nscious state the eyeballs turn upward and the gaze becomes fixed on the\npoint between the eyebrows.\n\nThere is a correspondence between the position of the eyes (and\nकि - - hence the -direction_of the gaze) and the mental state. _. By merely showing.\nanger on the face one can produce this emotion in the mind; by closing\nthe eyes one can invoke sleep, and by concentrating the eyes on the\npoint between the eyebrows in meditation one can induce the supercon-\nscious state.\n\nA man who is running cannot convince me he is sleeping, because his\nbody and eyes do not manifest the characteristic signs of sleep. Nor am\nI fooled if a person who is winking rapidly and breathing heavily claims\nthat he is in the superconscious state. In the conscious or ordinary\nwaking state the body, mind, breath, eyes, and pulse are restless. In\nthe subconscious or sleep state, the body, most muscles, the limbs, and\nthe senses are inactive. The pulse, breath, and heart motions are slow-\ner, and the eyelids are closed. In the superconscious state, the body\nand muscles are still; the heart, pulse, and breathing are very slow --\nalmost entirely quiet -- and the eyes become still and fixed on the\npoint between the eyebrows.\n\nThe eyeballs of pure-minded babies, undisturbed as yet by earth\nexperiences, will be found to be turned upward during sleep. At death,\nthe eyes of devoted people, or of people in a trance, tend to turn up-\nward. This happens because the light that flows from the actual lumi-\nnous eye in the medulla oblongata into the two physical eyes turns back,\nduring trance or death, first to the point between the eyebrows -- the\n\nछे Single astral eye of light reflected in the forehead from the medulla --\n\nand then reverts to the point of origin in the medulla.\n\n"}

The human body in standing pos-\nture with feet spread apart and arms outstretched at the sides is the\nepitome of the star of Cosmic Consciousness residing in the center of\nthe spiritual eye.\n\nThough the light of the spiritual eye may be seen by pressing the\nclosed eyes gently, its secret door can never be opened just by physical\npressure. It is only by deep concentration and fixing the eyes on the\npoint between the eyebrows, and by being able to hold the light before\nour inner gaze for any length of time with open or closed eyes, that we\ncan gradually learn to send the consciousness and the life force through\nthe spiritual eye into the Infinite. This signifies the wise men (or\nwise concentrated thoughts) following the telescopic star of the spiri-\ntual eye to behold the infinite Christ Consciousness.\n\nThe star also represents the mouth of the \"dove\" descending from\nheaven. The two halos of blue and gold are the wings of the dove. This\nspiritual emblem of the dove is called the Holy Ghost. “And the Holy के\nGhost descended in a bodily shape like a dove\" (Luke 3:22). Whosoever\nsees it during meditation, or is shown the third eye during spiritual\ninitiation, is baptized with the Holy Spirit. \"I saw the Spirit de-\nscending from heaven like a dove\" (John 1:32).\n\nThe two physical eyes are given to us by our human parents to cognize\nthis world of matter, i.e., a limited range of vibrations; owing to their\nlimited sensibility, the physical eyes see only certain vibrations of\nmatter. But by opening the spiritual eye man may behold God. A guru --\nliterally, one who leads from darkness (\"gu\") to light (\"ru\") -- is he\nwho is sent by God to help aspiring devotees to open the spiritual eye.\n\nThe life force is present in all the sensory motor nerves and cells\nin the body, but it is very strong in the eyes. Pressure on the eyes\n‘causes the energy or astral light to be squeezed out and made visible in\nthe darkness of the closed eyes. A blow on the head produces \"stars\"\nbecause the astral light wants to be separated from the physical. If\nthe head were hit hard enough, we would see these star sparks of life\nforever separated into space. Many people think that this is a physical\nlight and has no significance -- an utterly erroneous idea. The light\nis astral, and it can be seen with eyes either closed or open, or during\nmeditation, or at death. Many adepts, remaining conscious at the time\nof death, have beheld the: tunnel of light in the spiritual eye ushering\nthem into the Infinite.\n\n"}

Jesus’ great disciple John said: \"God\nis light\" ( John 1:5). Students who practice breathlessness, as given\nin the Hong-Sau Concentration Lesson, will say: \"Ah, death is not a\nchoking without air; it is escape from the clutch of breath into the\nbreathless Spirit.\" At the time of death the Self-Realization Fellowship\nStudent can say within: \"Oh, I see; this is the lesson of breathlessness\nI already know.

The yogi, on the other hand, practices throughout his\nmortal existence seeing this path of the spiritual eye situated between\nmatter and the Infinite, and thus is able to follow this path conscious-\nly during the transition of the soul from its temporary home of deathly\nchangeable matter to the ever existing, unchangeable Infinite.\n\n“The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single,\naa । thy whote-body shail be full of tight\" (Matthew -6:22).\"And. the light.\nshineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not\" (John 1:5).\n\nkkk\n\nTHOUGHTS TO REMEMBER As sunshine is given to everyone, yet some\n\npeople choose to live in utter darkness, so\nthe sunshine of God’s wisdom is scattered all over, yet some persons\nlook at the world through the dark glasses of their own ignorant thoughts.\nThose who live in the sunshine of wisdom are the happy ones. Develop\nyour mental powers. God knows everything, and you, being a child of\nGod, have His all-seeing and all-knowing power within you. When you\nincrease your perception and feeling, when the all-seeing eye is open,\nand when the all-accomplishing power is felt, then you will automatical-\nly absorb truth from the book of nature. Absorb truth within, not only\nthrough the limited power of the senses, but from the depths of silence\nwithin, through the unlimited power of your spiritual perception, of\nyour intuition.\n\nNo matter how many mistakes you make, if you have a sincere desire\nto know God’s truths, you will find them revealed to you.\n\nkkk\n\n"}

It would be quite audacious of the waves in\nthe sea to think that they create, preserve, and dissolve themselves\ninto the sea without the aid of any superior force. The storm creates\nthe wave, preserves its shape, and ultimately dissolves it in the sea.\n\nThere is an old story in India that, in the beginning of creation,\nthree intelligent godlike beings: emanated from God: Brahma, the creator\nof all things, Vishnu, the preserver of all things, and Shiva, the de-\nSstroyer of 211 things. The waves of creation were lifted into being by\nBrahma; they were sustained by Vishnu; and were dissolved by Shiva.\n\nOnce upon a time these three gods materialized themselves into human\nforms in order to visit this earth, one of the playgrounds of their\nomnipresent activities.

Study of books on the subject may clarify\nyour conception of concentration, but books do not give you the power of concen-\ntration. You must know how to achieve concentration and then practice in order\nto acquire the power.\n\nConcentration is the gateway to heaven. It is the gateway to power latent\nwithin you. Concentration means to gather the attention at one point. But how\ncan you do that if your attention is distracted? The root cause of many failures\nin life is lack of concentration. Attention is like a searchlight; when its beam\nis spread over a vast area, its power to focus ona particular object becomes\nweak, but focused on one thing at a time, it becomes powerful. Great men are\nmen of concentration. They put their whole mind on one thing at a time.\n\nOnly when the attention is free from sensation, thoughts, and memory\nthoughts, can you focus it on God. To thus detach attention from the senses and\nthoughts, and place it on God only, is called meditation. Sit quietly and medi-\ntate on the joy of silence. Think of that joy as communion with God. The more\nyou meditate, the more you will realize that nothing else can give you that\nrefined, increasing joy of silence. That experience of joy in meditation is com-\nmunion with God. Pray deeply, with devotion, first for God's love, then for\nwisdom, happiness, health, prosperity, and then for the fulfillment of any speci-\nfic legitimate wish.\n\nThe meditating devotee must do away with little body-attachments. He must\nlearn to be proof against warm or cold climates. He must learn to remain calm\nin the face of difficulties. He must learn to overcome hunger and pain. He must\nlearn to conquer all the appetites and attachments that have been allowed to\ngovern the body, for as long as the mind is focused on the body and its relation-\nship with the limited material world, the soul cannot remember its omnipresent\nnature.\n\nThe meditating saint is not in a negative state of stupor.

The heart\n\nand the medulla oblongata are the two switchboards\nthat control them. When the heart stops involuntarily, as at death, man loses\nthe use of these five instruments.

But the fact is that when\na sensation reaches the brain, that sensation immediately rouses thoughts.\n\nMan receives his sensations through the sensory nerves, and reacts through\nthe motor nerves. For example, pinch yourself onthe arm. That sensation is\nreceived by the brain through the sensory nerves, and is reacted upon by the\nmotor nerves as your arm twitches or pulls away. Your greatest enemies are\nsensations. If no sensations registered in the brain, you could not be disturbed.\nThoughts are the result of sensations or memories of sensations; if you can stop\nthem you can stop the thoughts.\n\nThrough Self-Realization Fellowship studies you have been learning how to\nwithdraw your life energy from the senses and rechannel it to the centers of\nhigher awareness in the spine and brain. Then you can go to the Infinite con-\nsciously. Most people do not know how to go into that state of silence. It is not\nan unconscious state, but an expansion of the consciousness from the boundaries\nof the body into boundless eternity. In this expansion of consciousness you know\nthat you are not limited by your little body. You live in the actual knowledge\nthat God is with you, and that all you have to do when you want to use your cre-\native power in any way is to remember that the unlimited way is through God.\nBy concentrating consciously, you can throw the searchlight of attention on God,\nand as soon as you become locked in communion with His joy, you can hear the\nsong of God--Aum, the music of the spheres. In that sound is the creative intel-\nligence of God. You want to attune yourself to that in order to achieve the high-\nest results--spiritual, mental, or material.\n\nSensations do not exist on the periphery of the body. You enjoy or suffer\nfrom them in the brain. The popular way to do away with thought is by diver-\nsion, but the scientific way is to shut off the senses so that one may easily and\ncompletely withdraw the attention from disturbing sensation-arousing objects.\n\nUnless you completely free the temple of attention from disturbing thoughts,\nGod will not manifest there. If you are thinking of something else when you are\npraying to God, He will not answer. Why should He? Your inattention is an\n\n"}

God doesn't\nsurrender Himself unless He is absolutely sure that every worldly thought is\nremoved from your mind. He is like a candle flame that cannot withstand the\ngust of restlessness. His light will burn steadily in your temple of meditation\nwhen you are free from restlessness. You must be completely attentive when\nyou offer unto the Divine Beloved the bouquet of your devotion. Call to God with\nyour heart and with your soul, that you may by the divine fervor of your heart\ncoax Him to reveal His face everywhere--evermore.\n\nMEDITATION EXERCISES . When by relaxation you withdraw the energy from\nthe body, you know with absolute assurance that\n\nyou are not the body; you are the energy burning in the lamp of flesh. Relaxa-\n\ntion, when it precedes meditation, is the way to the Infinite. The following med-.\n\nitation exercises will help you to release your soul fromconfinement in finitude\n\nto eternal freedom in Infinity. Practice these exercises during your morning\n\nor evening meditation periods, when you are in a quiet place.\n\n1. Sit upright, look out of the open window into the limitlessness of the sky.\n(If you cannot see the sky from your window, mentally visualize it.) Men-\ntally picture your mind watching your body, the room, and the sky simul-\ntaneously as its encasing body. Keep on meditating for a few minutes until\nyou feel that you are the body, the room, and the sky. This same medita-\ntion can be very fruitfully practiced either in the daytime or in the moon-\nlight, when on a mountaintop or at the ocean or in any beautiful scenic sur-\nroundings. 1\n\n2, Meditate in the following way: Sit upright on a chair or on your bed. Close\nyour eyes. Think that you are sitting on the center of the floor of your world\nhome, of which the sky is the roof; then picture this world home, decorated\nwith snow on the north and south poles, and inlaid with mountains, rivers,\nand pools of oceans filled with frothy, pure-white lilies of wavelets. Behold\nthe ferns of forests which bedeck your earthly house; now behold in your\nmind's eye all your relative nations, races, families, your loved ones,\nfriends, and so forth, gathered around you playing the drama of life on the\nstage of time. Then mentally say: ''Hello, everybody! my white, brown,\nred, and yellow fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and friends.'\"' Try\nto feel all races as your very own family and loved ones. Mentally say\nagain: ''Let us all bow to our One Father, God, who made us allinHis _\nimage. Let us bow to our same grandparents, Adam and Eve, whose one\nblood runs in all our veins. Let us thank God for putting us in our one big\nhome of the earth; let us live happily and harmoniously and do His will, that\nour home may become what He wants. it to be. \"'\n\n3. Meditate with closed eyes. Mentally say: \"I dissolve my body form in dark-\nness.'' Watch the limitless dark space of eternity spread above, beneath, in\nfront, behind, ahead, within and without--everywhere. Quickly visualize\nyourself as surrounded by a sealed rainbow balloon of light, a balloon of\n\n"}

Throw\nthe breath out very slowly and visualize this balloon of light as being\nexpanded by your luminous breath until it becomes big enough to contain\nthe star clusters, universes, and planetary and solar systems, including\nyour earth and your body--everything.\n\n4, Close your eyes. Look up mentally and keep on traveling mentally as far as\nyou can go into the sky. Look to the right mentally as far as you can, and\nthen look to the left as far as you can. Look down as far as you can; then\nbring your eyes to a focus between the eyebrows and concentrate at the cen-\ntral space in the heart and mentally say: \"I ama tiny speck of space in the\nheart, and Iam all space, alive with everlasting, ever new Bliss at every\npoint of space, spreading from within my body to the limitless beyond. My\nbody, mind, brain, intelligence, body cells, organs, and so forth, all con-\nstitute the living, intelligent space into which I swallow and absorb every-\nthing, and out of which I disgorge the glittering universe according to the\n\nwill of Spirit in me.\"\n\nBy constantly holding the peaceful aftereffects of meditation in mind; by feel-\ning immortality in the life force in the body; by believing in eternal life instead of\n\nbeing hypnotized by the illusory changes of temporal life;.and by feeling the ocean\nof immortal Bliss-God underlying the changeable waves of the experiences of\n\n____past lives--and the waves of perceptions of childhood, youth, and age in this\n\nlife--the soul can find not only perpetual rejuvenation in-itself, but also in the\nbody.\n\nJust as soon as man finds that the body is not isolated from Spirit, but is\ncomposed of a number of rising and falling waves of vibrating currents in the\nocean of Cosmic Consciousness, the perpetual rejuvenation of the Spirit can be\nimplanted in his body if he so desires. The ocean can help any wave to retain its\nform if it keeps pushing that wave from within its bosom; so man can retain\nphysical youth by asking the unchangeable, everlasting Ocean of Immortal Power\nbehind the wave of his mortal form to continue manifesting Itself as that vital\n\nyouthful form.\n\nae He\nINSPIRATION\n\nI sought to catch Thee in the secret waters of superconsciousness. To lure\nThee I used the bait of love. Its fragrance attracted many rare fish of sacred\ninspirations; the float-quill of my yearning bobbed often.

Then he put a small piece of straw in front of the three gods\nand addressed Brahma thus: 116 mighty, self-appointed creator of universes,\nuse your will and try to create, if you can, another piece of straw just like the\none you see before you.'' Brahma floated the Cosmic Energy out of himself\nand willed until he was exhausted, but he could not create a duplicate piece of\nstraw. Forehead beaded with perspiration, the puzzled Brahma sat down and\nbowed his head, vanquished and chagrined.\n\nThen the little boy said: 'Vishnu, please try to save this little piece of\nstraw that 1am going to destroy.'' The lad belched smoke and fire at the piece\nof straw and it melted and vanished. Vishnu, with all his preservative, almighty\nwill- command, could not keep that little piece of straw from being destroyed.\n\nThe little boy said: ''Behold, I bring back the little piece of straw. '' And\nthe piece of straw reappeared to their sight. Now the little boy turned and looked\nwith fiery eyes at Shiva and said: \"Almighty Shiva, destroyer of all things,\nplease try to dissolve this little piece of straw.'' Shiva opened up his\nspiritual eye and let loose a flood of world-dissolving fire. But although Shiva\nfoamed flames that set the whole forest of space ablaze, he could not even singe\nthat piece of straw. At last the three gods lowered their eyes and hung their\nheads and asked: ''Shining, blessed little child, who are you?'\"'\n\nHearing no response, they looked up and saw the little boy dissolving into\nthe ether as he gently said: ''You have yet to find out who lam--I, whose resi-\ndence is in you and in everything else!\"\n\nThis story illustrates that, no matter how powerful one becomes in life, he\nmust not forget his entire dependence upon the Cosmic Fountain of Life--the\nLife of all life, the God of all gods.\n\nPride is blinding, banishing the vision of vastness possessed by greater\nsouls. No matter how great a person is in a certain field, there will be found\nin time a greater one in the same orbit of achievement. Never forget that lurk-\ning around the future turns of the pathway of life there may be someone greater\nthan you, as was true in the case of the three most powerful gods, who became\nwiser through the knowledge that their powers were only borrowed from His\nSupreme Excellency, the God of all gods. So before pride blinds you and shuts\nout the vision of the Infinite, you should learn that no matter whether you are\na successful business-man, a powerful politician, a dictator, or a great reform-\ner, your power is naught but the reflected power of God. Humbleness is the\nopen gate through which the Divine Flood of mercy and power loves to flow into\nthe recipient souls.\n\n(Conclusion)\n\n"}

A pound of organic flesh when burned becomes a little less thana\npound of inorganic carbon.\n\nConsciousness consists of various rates of intelligent vibration, and mat-\nter consists of differently vibrating electrons. Electrons are constituted of\ndifferently vibrating emanations of conscious cosmic energy, and cosmic €~\nergy is vibrating cosmic intelligence: God in matter is vibrating intelligent\nenergy. God is acting in the minds of men as the vibration of intelligence.\nGod is therefore not only the vibrating energy and consciousness that pervade\neverything, but also the ''frozen'' energy and consciousness that we behold as\nmatter.\n\nVibration is a quivering, stirring force. Guided by conscious discrimina-\ntion, it arranges itself into a livable harmonious universe. If vibration were\nnot intelligent and beautiful, the universe might be only a meaningless mass\nof mud, or nothing but vapor or water; or there might be an earth without\nbeings, or human beings might have been created without vegetation for food\nsupply. The order in everything clearly shows that there is one Intelligence\nthat guides the vibrations to so arrange themselves as to form an orderly\nsystematic universe, and an earth whereon are possible a routine of seasons\nand laws of life. Manifested Spirit, then, is discriminative, beautiful vibra-\ntion. If vibration alone existed without intelligence to guide it, then it would\nbe only a powerful force without any conscious ability to create a systematic\nuniverse.\n\n"}

These summaries\nare intended to refresh your memory of, and to fix firmly in your mind,\nthe most vital points presented in the preceding lessons. These reviews\nwill also enhance your understanding of the relationship between theory\nand practice of the techniques, and of the importance of one to the\nother. Review is an important factor in any study, and particularly in\nthe study of Self-Realization Fellowship teachings; for if you have been\nsteadfastly practicing the techniques, you will find that each time you\nreview a lesson you will discover something worthwhile that may have es-\ncaped you in previous study or perhaps unexpected satisfaction in a point\nthat had not particularly impressed you before. It is through repetition\nof and meditation upon the truth that we learn the most.\n\nThe summaries include some explanatory notes not contained in the\nlesson proper. It has been our sincere purpose to present the authentic\n\"why\" of all the principles expounded by the masters of India. In order\nto cover thoroughly and comprehensively these fundamental principles,\nthe summaries that constitute Lesson 104 will be continued in a series\nof installments.\n\nThe review questions at the end of each installment of the summaries\nare intended to help you in your study of the lessons, and aid in evalu-\nating your understanding of the teachings.

You\nknow yourself as a creator, possessing unlimited power, and you realize\nyour responsibility to the Father’s plan. The laws of the Cosmos are\nthe laws of your being. God’s work is your work.\n\nThe real devotee consciously accepts God’s will as his own, as the\nwill of all good, so he forgets his little self in the greater Self and\n"}

In having consciously accepted his\nheritage, he is now aware of a more rapid expansion of consciousness and\na preparation for the light that until now would have been too great for\nhim to bear. If all this has been accomplished, the next step opens the\ngate to complete liberation.\n\nLESSON 79 Behind your will is the will of God--the flow of unlimited\n\nenergy seeking to manifest all that is good. This is why,\nif you tune in with divine will and never waver in your efforts, you\ncannot fail.\n\nWill is desire plus energy directed toward fulfillment. There is\nnothing that can be accomplished without will power, not any act of your\ndaily life. Most people will do all manner of unessential things, and\ndo not concentrate their efforts constructively. To wish is not to will,\nthough wishing may be the forerunner of willing. ।\n\nIn developing will power, you first must make up your mind, using\nreason, discrimination, and wisdom. Then exercise and use your will\nconsciously toward a specific purpose. And never give up until you\nreach your objective. When you tune in with divine will, and revolve\nyour mind and will -continuously around a certain idea, your will becomes\nimpregnated with power. ©\n\nHuman will, directed by selfish desire and ignorance, brings suffer-\ning and trouble. You cannot know any lasting happiness until you desire\nGod and truth above all things, and turn your will toward the never-to-\nbe-given-up search for God.\n\nRemember that your will, harnessed to divine will, can blaze like a\nflame through any situation or difficulty. A thought coupled with action\nby dynamic will brings that thought into outward form. Nothing can per-\nmanently withstand it. But beware of will wrongly directed.

Their dynamic active prayer is:\n\"Thy will be done.\"\n\nLESSON 80 To most people this life is an amazing paradox because\n\ntheir sense of values is not true. They seek happiness in\ntrying to fulfill desires that expand the ego instead of living so as to\nexpand soul qualities. It rests with us whether we live and express the\nlight of God, or blunder along, swathed in the veil of ignorance.\n\nThe first thing to do to rend the veil of ignorance--and to repair\nyour mind microphone so that you can broadcast your prayers to God, and\nreceive His answer--is to practice concentration and meditation deeply.\nPeace and accomplishment are the flowers grown through daily meditation.\nRight meditation must flower into right action.\n\nOne of the greatest enemies to success is fear, for it destroys\ninitiative without which one cannot succeed. Mental laziness, lack of\ninitiative, and lack of perseverance are barriers to success.\n\nIt is not success itself which should be the goal, but the kind of\nliving which brings success. Too great an eagerness for success may be\nits own hindrance. Sustained creative effort and definite purpose are\nessential to success.\n\nCreative effort can be put into any kind of work you may be doing at\nthe present time. Being made in God’s image you are a creator. What are\nyou creating? Your problems and tests are creative material, and God\nnever gives you more than you have the innate strength to handle.\n\nRemember: if you think you are going down, just \"give one more\npunch.\"\n\nAvoid an inferiority feeling. It is false. You are a child of God,\nand the servant of all. \"\n\nGood books are good friends. Read with attention and intuitive per-\nception. Digest ideas, and assimilate truths. Do not be just a collec-—\ntor of information through your reading, but garner wisdom from the great\nminds of all ages and make it your own through intelligent thinking and\nassimilation.\n\nAlthough there is a certain vibratory influence of stars upon human\nlives owing to interrelated cosmic forces of attraction and repulsion, a\nman of infinite will power, tuned in with God, uses his free will to\nchange his environment. He marches on, influenced by the Sun of all\nsuns, the Almighty Spirit. To him, from the depths of his determination\nand faith, all things are possible. He burns the seeds of difficulties\nin the fire of wisdom, and consults only God for guidance.\n\n"}

Proper diet is very important in building vitality.

If you forget to put some of the right materials in a cake, you\nwill find there is something wrong with the cake. And so it is with the\nhuman body. Sixteen elements are necessary ingredients in good body-\nbuilding. If any of them are omitted, there result bodily defects which\nare called \"disease.\" So you see, it is up to you to see that you build\nyour body of the correct materials, including all of the necessary\nelements. All the proper food materials can be classified under the\nfollowing: minerals, vitamins, carbohydrates, proteins, fats.\n\nIndividuals differ in their needs as regards amount and proportion\nof these classes of foods. Occupational activity is one factor. The\nneed of strengthening certain faculties and organs and body parts is\nanother consideration. So it takes study of foods and study of your\nneeds, in order to select your food properly.\n\nGive attention to this Lesson and note the corrections you should\nmake in your own diet; then start right away to do something about it.\nPractice the stomach exercise to stimulate and improve digestion.\n\nIt must be remembered that the Lessons on vitalopathy are given to\nhelp you awaken the life force in each organ.

It should separate the dross of superstition from real reli-\ngion by burning it in the furnace of scientific research.\n\nThe scriptures, in order to be worth-while, should give help to man in\nevery walk of life. They do contain such material and instruction, and both\nthe material and psychological interpretations are necessary--although the\nspiritual interpretations are of the greatest importance. The truly spiritual\nman is the balanced, all-round man, happy, healthy, intellectual, prosperous,\nand wise.\n\nGod made us angels of energy encased in the material bulb of flesh. We\nhave so concentrated upon the fragile globe that we have forgotten our inde-\nstructible immortal self charged with eternal life energy. We must now make\nreal concentrated effort to feel His consciousness of omnipresence again.\n\nThe root of hope is in the secret spring of the soul's intuition, its forgot-\nten knowledge. Hope is born of the intuitive consciousness in the soul that we\nshall sometime remember the image of God within us. The first flower of\nthis hope is faith. Hope for the highest and best, for that is your birthright.\nWhen hope is used properly to work for the acquisition of the soul's lost intu-\nition, then faith, or intuitive Self-realization, develops.\n\n@ LESSON 86 You may believe what you hear and read, but to positively\nknow a thing, you must experience it in your own conscious-\n\n"}

Until you have experienced God, made actual God-\ncontact, which is the realization of your oneness with God, and therefore, of\nGod's unity with all manifested things and unmanifested cosmos, you do not\nknow God.\n\nGod is visible to you in the beauty and grandeur of nature. He speaks to\nyou through sweet music, the song of birds, the gentle loving voices of your\ndear ones, and in the thundering call of duty. The urge within us to find per-\nfection, peace, happiness, immortality, and conscious knowledge, is God's\nvoice calling us back to His mansion of oneness. It is His image within us\ntrying to manifest itself through our matter-bound consciousness.\n\nThe only way to know God is to experience Him in deepest meditation.\nGod is present right on the throne of peace within you. You can know Him\nwithin, in the peace and bliss of meditation, then realize Him as peace exist-\ning inthe harmony of all things without. Forget your little isolated life-wave,\nand know yourself as a part of the great human family, one with universal life.\n\nTo love God-created things more than God, is not wisdom. Make your\ngoal the source, the fountain of all powers, God. Perform your material\nduties well, and at the same time do your duty to God by keeping your contact\nwith Him in meditation. Above all, never neglect God.\n\nLESSON 87 The development of intuition quickens evolution in the indi-\n\nvidual because through intuition one can know any phase of\ntruth correctly and directly. This kind of knowledge brings understanding of\nthe purpose of life, and it is through complete understanding that wisdom is\nborn. Complete understanding embraces all phases of outer manifestation\nand inner truth, so that all appearance of division and duality is dissolved in\nthe blaze of that perception. Intuition thus developed can reveal the real\nnature of the substances and phenomena of all things. To develop intuition\nwithin you is to establish the omnipresent image of God within you. All new\ntruths are nothing but old hidden truths once known to the soul and Spirit, and\ngive us joy by becoming familiar to us again.\n\nThe door of intuition may become effectually closed through self-sufficien-\ncy and egotism, or through too full a dependence upon intellectual channels of\neducation through inferential education. The knowledge which is obtained\nthrough mechanical schooling, sense experience, and one's own power of in-\nference, is necessarily limited.\n\nCorrect methods of education consist of the development of intuition and\nbringing back to the plane of human consciousness the memory of all knowl-\nedge already existing in the soul.

Inferential reasoning is based upon the testi-\nmony of our senses. Our senses tell us only of the most superficial aspect of\nmatter. Even reasoning is based upon knowledge derived from sense testi-\nmony. Science frequently has to discard all its previous findings on a certain\nsubject as some new and heretofore unknown factor comes to light. Our senses\ndo not tell us the whole truth, and therefore the data furnished by them may\nlead to conclusions that are entirely wrong, or, at best, incomplete.\n\nHence, although the power of inferential reasoning has its uses, still it is\nincapable of proving the ultimate nature of Reality. It is useful in that the\nvery power of concentration used is itself a stride in the development of intu-\nition. Intense effort in concentration, followed by relaxation and meditation,\nwill open the door to perception of Reality. It is in the silence that truth\ndawns upon the consciousness, like a light breaking through mist. But concen-\ntration, reasoning, and logic prepare the mind for acceptance and recognition,\nand hence understanding. | ।\n\nThe authority of the scriptures is not proof of their truth, because they\nmust be interpreted by human beings of limited powers. According to Patan-\njali, any real inner teachings in scriptures of East or West cannot be under-\nstood through the testimony of others, but can be grasped only by testing them\ndirectly by the power of intuition. Individual realization is the only proof of\nthe truth of the scriptures.\n\nBefore studying the scriptures, calm and steady yourself, physically and\nmentally; then take a few lines and meditate upon them for some time. Be-\nware of self-sufficiency of the intellect in study of spiritual books. Intellec-\ntual study of the scriptures with the sole desire to learn, know, and feel, leads\nto realization.

If a man's mind and feelings are rightly trained, he can watch\nan operation on his body without feeling the pain.\n\nTherefore it is necessary to become acquainted with death by learning to\nconsciously control the heartbeat and breath so that we may declare with St.\nPaul: ''Verily, I protest by our rejoicing which I have in Christ, I die daily.\"\n\nDeath is experienced differently by different people, according to the\nlives they have led. The nightmares or pleasant dreams they experience are\nself-created by their own actions preceding death.\n\nIn death the power of touch goes first; then smell, taste, vision, and last-\nly hearing. Never discuss the condition of a dying man within range of his\nhearing; his body or speech may be paralyzed, but he may be perfectly able to\nhear you.\n\nEven if you are not yet perfected in the art of living directly by life-energy\nas great yogis can, you can begin your march toward freedom from fear of\ndeath by ceasing to be attached to the care of the body.

The Soul, as Spirit's reflection, is individualized, ever-existing, ever-\nconscious, ever-new Bliss, but being identified with the three (ideational,\nastral, and physical) bodies, and their normal and abnormal conditions, takes\non their natures.\n\nThe linking channel between conscious and subconscious minds, and also\nthe semi-superconscious mind, is unbroken. There is never unconsciousness.\nThe ordinary human ego generally travels to the realm of sensation during the\nstate of wakefulness, then wanders in the chamber of dreams during sleep,\nand is able to bring back some dream memories into the conscious hours of\nwakefulness.\n\nIn the student on the path of meditation, the ego begins to resume its nor-\nmal state of calmness, peace, and joy, and the conscious state then becomes\nmarked by restfulness.

Cosmic Consciousness is the conscious-\nness of God the Father expressing itself not only in, but beyond creation. The\nconsciousness in Jesus was Christ Consciousness, the universal realization\nin which he could feel all the sorrows of the world as his own. He endured\nthe finite struggle to show the way of salvation through Christ Consciousness\nto all, that all might be \"raised\" with him into that Consciousness. He re-\nentered Cosmic Consciousness when the finite struggle on earth was over.\n\nIt is not a simple matter to feel Cosmic Consciousness.

Seek permanent, ever new joy--the dynamo from which all powers\ncome. With determination and never ceasing effort, plunge forward and tear\nasunder the veils that hide His Presence. The memory of God is the altar of\nHis Presence. Your love for Him is the open door. If you make up your mind,\nnothing can hold you back.

Practice this discipline over the\nbody to free your mind and lift your consciousness from the body to the Infinite.\nA bent spine keeps the electric currents busy with the muscles and flesh,\nmakes one muscle-bound, and prevents concentration upon God.\n\nYour kingdom is omnipresence. This does not mean that you have to dis-\nregard and forget the body, but rather that you include your body in this expan-\nsion of consciousness. Do not be conscious only in the body. You must be\nable to feel this expansion in space, in the thoughts of others, in the percep-\ntive quality of your mind, in an increased alertness of all your faculties, and\nin your increased capacity for enjoyment. Color becomes more brilliant to\nyou, sound more marvelous, feeling more exquisite and intense, the farther\nyou advance on the spiritual path.\n\nYou are not meditating if you are dozing. Never allow yourself to get into\na negative state, but keep the attention constantly pointed to God, like the needle\nof a compass. No matter what you are doing, keep thinking of God. Enjoy\neverything with the Infinite, and be happy always.\n\nThe little plant of your Self-realization is delicate and fragile. It must be\nguarded and carefully tended. Water it with meditation and keep away from it\nthe weeds of worries, fears, and anger.\n\nYou can learn to shift at will from one state of consciousness to another\nby the simple practice of shifting the position of the eyes. Relax in a comfort-\nable position, close the eyes, become passive, mentally listless, \"let go\" and\ndoze. Practice this until you can fall asleep instantly by closing the eyes, thus\nswitching off the optical currents. Again, when you are heavy with sleep,\nquickly open and level the eyes, gaze directly in front of you, unwinkingly\ntense the whole body and become wide awake.\n\nTo shift your consciousness to the superconscious plane, direct your eyes\nand attention to the point between the eyebrows, and instantaneously go con-\nsciously into the state of deep peace, intoxicating joy. These states of con-\nsciousness must be genuine and accompanied by their bodily indications. Asin\nthe subconscious state your body will have all the signs of sleep, so the super-\nconscious state will be accompanied by the consciously stilled heart, fixed\ngaze, and breathlessness.\n\nLESSON NO. 94 Satan, being an intelligent creative force projected from\n\nGod, realized that finite creation, since it retained its\noriginal essense as do the waves of the ocean, would return again to the In-\nfinite after its cycle of perfect existence. This cosmic force or Satan, a going-\nout from God, having free choice, came to desire an individual existence and\ncontinued power over finite creation.

God represents the innate soul of man. You are free to choose. God\nwill not break His own laws by using force to destroy Satan, but He is ever\nusing the mighty power of love to draw you back to Him. Love eventually de-\nstroys evil in the manner that light destroys darkness. Even Satan himself\nwill eventually be taken back into God. We cooperate with God when we choose\n\ngood.\n\nAll our suffering is caused by our own wrong choice, in which we cooperate\nwith the negative, outgoing force.

We come\neventually to avoid evil naturally through wisdom.\n\nThe power that holds the universe together is Divine Will. In your body\nthe power that heals is life force.

It comes from being inwardly happy at all\ntimes, while putting forth your utmost effort to understand and uproot causes\nof unhappiness. One should strive for health, an efficient mind, prosperity,\nthe right kind of work, and true wisdom.\n\nOne should not be submissive to unsuitable environment. Environmental\ntroubles are born of your own past actions in the first place. You have woven\nyour own cocoon of bondage. The first thing to do is to try to understand the\n। cause of your environmental bondage, so that you can eradicate from your\n| phy sical and mental bodies all lingering infection of discord. This brings\n¢ @ “about a mental résurrection, giving rise to spiritual realization, and eventual-\n\nly resurrection into the Spirit. Resurrect your consciousness from the envi-\nronment of ignorance. It is better to be unhappy about your own ignorance\nthan to die happily with it. Remain awake and alive always, ever ready and\ndesirous to learn and to behave properly. The self-improving person is the\nincreasingly happy person, and is influential in promoting the happiness of\nothers.\n\nEven though you believe yourself to be strong, evil environment has a sub-\ntle influence that gradually undermines your fortifications, and so every effort\nmust be made to attain good environment. Seek soul joy instead of mere\nsense pleasure. To exterminate a bad habit, negatively avoid everything that\noccasions it or stimulates it. Then positively plant a good habit and cultivate\nit with great intensity until it becomes a part of yourself.\n\nDo not become discouraged by failure. In failures lie the seeds of suc-\ncess. Weed out the causes of failure with undiminished perseverance, re-\n\ndouble your vigor, and ''keep on keeping on.'' Success lies in the good fight\nrather than in ultimate attainment. One who dies trying builds better than he\nknows.\n\nBegin from today to try to do, one thing at a time, the things you thought\n| । it impossible for you to do.\n\nKeep your balance.

Material duty is very important and\nmust be supplemented with social, patriotic, and international duties. Intel- @\nlectual duty is superior to material duty. Consciousness of spiritual and\n\nmoral duty should reign predominantly in the mind. Draw on your unused res-\n\nervoir of talent and power. Resurrect your mind from the little habits that\n\nkeep you worldly, and smile the million-dollar smile of happiness that no one\n\ncan take from you.\n\nLife force is intelligent. It guides creation. Electricity is more or less\na blind force; it has only instinctive intelligence. Electricity is the animal\ncurrent of the spiritual world. Life force is finer than any other force exist-\ning; it is the power which goes out in healing. It emanates from the brain as\nlight, so the halo often pictured on saints is not a myth.\n\nLESSON NO. 99 Human beings reason according to their own mentalities,\n\ntheir own degrees of understanding and knowledge. The\nhuman idea of God is extremely vague in the minds of the majority of people.\nMany simply accept an orthodox concept of God, and give the question very\nlittle individual thought. Others reason God into a mold of their own ideals.\nFew definitely set out to verify their beliefs, or find out for themselves what\nGod is. The last is what each should and cando. Be humble but determined\nin your intention to find the way.\n\nThe manifested world is a world of continual cause and effect, but God is\nCauseless. This is hard for the human mind to grasp, because it reasons\nfrom experience. But behind all things is that which simply is--Spirit. Spirit\nalone was. When Spirit began to create, it became God the Father. The bail\nof vibration is the Holy Ghost. Spirit beyond creation, that which creates, is\ncalled ''God the Father.'' The consciousness in creation is Christ Conscious-\nness (Son).\n\nWe must know that every human being is an expression of the great, vast\nSpirit. These expressions are waves of the ocean of understanding; behind\nall is the unceasing ocean of truth. We think that God is invisible to us, but in\nreality He is visible to us in the whole manifested universe. He is That which\n१ behind all things and That which is in all things.\n\nHuman beings are controlled by something like radioactive and vitoactive\nenergy from God. Infinite Spirit, everywhere present, is in us, and in It we\nmove and breathe and have our being. We are inthe sea of Cosmic Conscious-\nness, and by removing the cork of ignorance from our physical-mental recep-\ntacle, we may become one in understanding and consciousness with that Cos-\nmic Sea. The Spirit, having become individualized in the soul, is struggling\nto resurrect itself and return to the ocean of Spirit.\n\nTo live in forgetfulness and unconsciousness of God is to live in tears and\nsuffering until in that suffering is born the desire, and the determination to\nknow the Cause.

You will never stand alone and friendless if you con-\nos contact God.

Be free to choose. Do not let yourself be bound and limited\nby any sense habit or by environment. Do not let anything or anyone control\nyou. Test your habits and see if they are controlling you. Show them that\nyou have dominion. Let nothing interfere with your happiness. The octopus\nof habits that clutches you and keeps you from the joys of the Spirit must be\ndislodged once and for all. You will never be satisfied and free from misery\nuntil you find God and abide in Him. Your soul, a separate segment, must\nfind the Whole to be complete.\n\nPractice the three special meditation exercises as given in this lesson.\nKnow yourself as Infinite.\n\nRemember that virtue always triumphs in the end, even though it may take\nmore than one lifetime. Never become discouraged through suffering and loss-\nes. You will enter into your true kingdom at last, in happiness beyond expec-\ntation.

In the heat of such concentration, that which you\nseek must reveal its secrets. Such concentration directed toward God is\ncalled meditation. The joy-contact in meditation is contact of God.

Often the rarest gems are in inaccessible places;\nrare spiritual treasures, too, have to be unearthed with the pickax of under-\nstanding and wisdom. The scriptural truths embodied in the Biblical record\nof Genesis describe the beginning of creation. But the scientific spiritual\n=| of these passages remains hidden from most people because they\ndo not know how to perceive or interpret the truth.\n\nThe ocean may be willing to pour itself into a cup, but the cup can hold\nonly its own capacity. Similarly, the truth is hidden in the Bible for anyone\nto find, but people with limited intelligence do not try to look beneath the sur-\nface. They cannot understand it because they do not know how to find out the\ntruth in it. We must try to learn how to do this.\n\nThe question is not 'What is truth?\" but, ''How can we grasp truth?'' For\ninstance, the way to apply the laws of Patanjali to discover the truths hidden\nin pure universal teachings and scriptures is to live those teachings in life.\n\nI asked a spiritual hypocrite if he had read the Christian Bible. 'I have read\nit a hundred times, Sir, '' he replied. 'I know all about it. \"'\n\nIt was to forestall this kind of desecration of truth that in ancient India\nthe Vedas and the Hindu Bible (Bhagavad-Gita) were kept unprinted for cen-\nturies. The spiritual truths they contain were handed down from memory by\nsages to their most devout disciples. Only a few received all the truth.\nOthers were told no more than they could realize at one time. Now almost\nany yoga book or world scripture may be bought for a few cents and intellec-\ntually swallowed with little effort. But devouring assorted ideas from the\nscriptures without digesting them creates only a greed for more books and\nmore ideas, resulting in chronic indigestion and spiritual nonassimilation.\n\nA thirsty man coming upon a lake craved to swallow all its waters. Nat-\nurally, he could not drink more than his stomach would hold. Likewise,\nmany thirsty seekers of limited understanding sit by the lake of truth and\naspire to drink all of its vast waters and contain all of its mysteries. They\ndo not understand even this truth: that to swallow those waters requires an\nunderstanding of equal magnitude.\n\nWestern philosophers have always assumed that truth can be known by\n\n"}

Immanual Kant was the first among 1 to question\nwhether man had the requisite faculties for knowing truth fully.\n\nThe seeker of truth should thoroughly scrutinize various beliefs; but in-\ndiscriminate reading of religious books written by novices or untried enthusi-\nasts yields only an indigestible hash of imagination, emotional outpourings,\nand diluted realization. Patanjali's yoga philosophy (embodied in the Yoga\nSutra), the Christian Bible, the Hindu Bible (Bhagavad-Gita), and a few other\nbooks written by men of realization should be studied, a little at a time, and\nmeditated upon for hours or for days together. The best time to read scrip-\nture is after practicing meditation, when the intuitive feeling is awake.\n\nSpiritual books should not be read \"from cover to cover'! as you would\nread a novel. Read a little, and inwardly digest what you have read. Spiritu-\nal books should be a perpetual inspiration because they continually give spiri-\ntual nourishment; as you masticate their message, you will more and more\nreap the good results of realizing their hidden truths. My Master taught me\nhow to perceive them. Then, one day, he told me that he wouldn't teach me\nany more. He said: ''Go and study the scriptures; whatever page you open to,\nyou will understand what is written there. '' Each sentence and paragraph of\nintellectually studied scripture should be substantiated by a corresponding\nrealization; and then a little more should be read and realized, and so on.\n\n| । \"` “HOW TO PERCEIVE TRUTH (112४ is the best way to test the truth of the\nscriptures? How are you to test which oneis\n\ntrue? Suppose you have before you the Hindu Bible, the Islamic Bible, and\nthe Christian Bible... How do you know that they contain the truth? Much\nscripture is not truth, but the product of repeated mistranslations made by\nmen without actual spiritual realization. The fact that many people believe in\na certain statement is not evidence that it is the truth. Sometimes one man\nknows more than the rest of the world: Columbus had correctly deduced that\nthe earth was round but no one believed him. The majority of people are like\na herd of sheep. If one jumps from a cliff, the whole flock jumps with him.\n\nThere are two methods of perceiving truth--by intelligence and by intu -\nition. The intellectual method depends upon sense perceptim and intelligence;\nbut sense perception deceives us, or at best limits the application of our in-\ntelligence. If you base your ideas of truth on the testimony of sense percep-\ntion, then the conclusion may be wrong. Our senses are all limited instru-\nments of perception; therefore we cannot perccive truth intellectually except\nin a limited way.\n\nMan's intelligence is not only limited but may even be deceived by mis-\nleading sense perceptions. For instance, we see smoke on a distant hill and\nconclude that there is afire. But on going to that hill we may find that the\n\n| । \"smoke\" was just a cloud of dust. Therefore we say that the appearance of\ntruth (the phenomenon) can be known by the intelligence, but the noumenon,\nor truth itself, can only be known by intuition.\n"}

If the data is wrong, the inference is wrong. Therefore reason can- @\nnot be the sole proof of any bible. Besides, our senses are so limited in\n\ntheir power that they are deceiving us all the time. You see only what the\n\nlimited power of the eye permits. You hear only certain vibrations within\n\nthe hearing range of the human ear.\n\nINTUITION IS NEVER WRONG Intuition, on the other hand, is developed by\n\nmeditation--conscious direct communion\nwith the omniscient soul consciousness. Therefore intuition can never be\nwrong; but this power within us has for the most part remained undeveloped.\nThe consciousness of existence arises from intuition. You do not need reason\nto know that you exist. ।\n\nTherefore intuition is the power that tests truth. You must feel, you\nmust realize truth before you can know that it is true. What seems true to\nreason and sense perception is not always true in fact. The only sure way to\nknow truth is to realize it intuitively. To know the atom, you must become\none in consciousness with the atom. You must become what you want to know.\nCan you know the taste of sugar without tasting it? No! So it is with the meta-\nphysician: he experiences everything within himself. The scientist experi-\nments with things outside himself.\n\nIntuition does not mean self-sufficiency, or blind faith in one's own opin-\nions. But calm reason plus calm feeling can lead to intuition when guided by\nmeditation. So the more you meditate and reason in a calm state, the more\nintuition you will have. In order to test truth, you must experience it intui-\ntively. The whole philosophy of the East is based upon intuitive experience.\nNomatter how intellectual you are, you may be still a child in spiritual reali-\nzation. You must realize the truth yourself. You must experience truth be-\nfore you can know that it is true. That is the power by which we must test\nthe scriptures.\n\nTHOUGHTS TO REMEMBER In the study of spiritual books, be warned\n\nagainst the self-sufficiency of the intellect.\nAlthough you may hear or read the words ''Cosmic Consciousness'' many\ntimes, that does not mean that you know about it. The best way to understand\nthe scriptures is to read and thoroughly study them. Intellectual study of the\nscriptures without a corresponding realization produces vanity and a false\nconviction that one knows, and is detrimental to realization; but intellectual\nstudy of the scriptures with the sole desire to learn, know, and feel, leads to\nrealization.\n\nBefore studying the scriptures, calm and steady yourself, then take two\nor three lines and meditate on them for several minutes. When the meaning\nbecomes one with yourself, close the book and go about your business. One | ।\nhour of regular meditation is worth more than one month of theoretical study\nof the scriptures. In meditation, direct knowledge is received.\n"}

Blowing trumpets and cow-horns, they\nfiled into a jungle. After bagging many game birds, wild boars, fleet-footed\ndeer, and fierce, cruel tigers, the prince and his party discovered that they\nhad lost their way. They had food, but no water, and although they galloped\naround the jungle in frantic search, they could find none. Neither had they\nany shelter against the danger of marauding wild animals during the night,\nwhich was fast approaching.\n\nJust as the sun was about to sink out of sight, the prince, who was riding\na little ahead of his party, came unexpectedly upon a crumbling old cottage.\nDismounting, the prince pushed upon the unlatched door and entered. Inside,\nall was dark except for a faint glimmer of light peeping through a hole in the\n= \"Surely the cottage is deserted, '' he thought in despair, but hoping\nagainst hope the prince called aloud: ''Hello, is anyone here?\"\n\nTo his surprise, a calm, firm voice replied: \"Iam here. Do you want\nwater?'' The prince peered intently into the semidarkness until he made out\nthe figure of a man. Astounded that this person could know his thoughts even\nbefore meeting or knowing him, the prince asked his host: ''Who are you?\"\n\"Iam only a poor hermit, '' was the answer.\n\nThe hermit lit a lamp, and the prince then called in his retinue. They\nwere overjoyed to be provided with water and fruits by their host in this lone-\nly jungle retreat. \"Aren't you afraid of tigers and snakes?'' the prince asked\nthe hermit. ''Oh, no, 1! the old man replied. ''The tigers are my pussycats,\nand the cobras are also pets. They and I are friends, ever basking in the\nsunshine of God's love, which is in everything. \"\n\nAs the prince scrutinized the hermit curiously, he was taken aback at the\nsight of two cobras hanging like a garland from the holy man's neck. When\nthe prince approached closer for a better look at the snakes, they hissed and\nlifted their hooded heads, for they felt the unpleasant vibrations of fear and\nvengefulness hidden in his breast.\n\nJust at that moment there was near panic among the prince's followers;\na huge royal Bengal tiger had come into the cottage! He calmly sat down at\nthe feet of the hermit; after receiving his meed of patting from the holy man,\nthe tiger ambled slowly away into the dark woods.\n\nAmazed, the proud prince thought: 'This old man seems to be good and\nkind; he has saved our lives from predatory wild beasts and parching thirst.\nI would like to make him rich and prosperous. '' Addressing the holy man, he\nsaid: \"Hoary hermit, your face is beaming with kindness and sincerity. I\nappreciate all that you have done for me and for my party. Therefore lam\ngoing to tell you a secret that will enable you to become very rich, a secret\n\n"}

With this, the prince\npulled out a stone from beneath a fold in his garment. He continued: \"I am\ngoing to entrust to you this family treasure, a philosophers' stone, so that\nyou may become rich by using it. This gold-making stone was given to my\nfather by a great alchemist. It has the power to convert into gold anything\nyou touch with it.

Thought, energy, and finite matter are different\nrates of vibration, different forms of motion.\n\nWhen Spirit created the vibratory universe of finite matter, the first man-\nifestation was vibration--the vibration of thought. Spirit became three: the\nCreator, the power of creation, and the object created (the finite universe).\nGod in the role of Creator is vibratory Intelligence.\n\nThis vibratory Intelligence manifests as cosmic intelligent energy. In the\nbody this cosmic intelligent energy is epitomized in the spiritual eye seen in\ndeep meditation. Vibration has sound, and the cosmic sound, another mani-\nfestation of the vibratory Intelligence is epitomized in the body in the sound of\nOm heard during deep inner silence. By seeing through the spiritual eye, one\nmay behold the whole universe as light, as a chick coming out of the dark egg-\nshell beholds the vast kingdom of solar light. In the lesson giving the Om med-\nitation technique you learned how to hear and listen to the sound of the Cosmic\nVibration in the body and in the whole cosmos.\n\nThe Christian symbol of the dove descending from heaven represents the\nHoly Spirit descending as sacred vibration to create the finite cosmos.

When you have Christ Conscious-\nness, your consciousness is expanded to behold everything.\n\nThe active intelligence of God the Father in creation is Christ Conscious-\nness; the only approach to this consciousness is through the Holy Ghost--''the\nfaithful witness'' or sound emanating from that vibration.

The trouble is that very few people are able to\n\nunderstand the Bible. The Biblical truths do not require\nrevision, but men's interpretations of them need to be revised.

The wise ones break through the shell of the outer literal meaning by\nmeans of the nutcracker of intuitional verification of spiritual truths.\n\nTHE BEGINNING The Indo-Aryan (Hindu) Scriptures date back ten\nACCORDING TO thousand years before the Christian era. They taught\nHINDU SCRIPTURES that the universe is divided into:\n\n1) Ideational or causal universe, which is the idea of God impinged on\nmatter or vibratory force.\n\n2) Subtle or astral universe of finer forces of electricity, gravitation,\nattraction, repulsion, electrons, life energy--forces beyond sensory\nperception.\n\n3) Material universe of grosser vibrations, for example: solids, liquids,\ngases, fire, water, earth, air, and ether.\n\nThe vibratory force of matter is guided by God's intelligence--solids,\nliquids, gases, etc., all manifesting some definite form. The material uni-\nverse has been molded by Divine Intelligence. Everything in it is a manifesta-\ntion not only of an idea, but also of some useful correlation; for example, God\ncreated hunger, but He also created food to satisfy it.\n\nThe idea universe contains the blueprint of the astral universe, which in\nturn contains the plan of the material universe.

The\nprince saw the hermit casually tuck it under the light band of clothing at his\nwaist. (Many people in India carry their money this way--safe from the reach\nof pickpockets!) Then the prince departed.\n\nAfter a year he came back again with his retinue, expecting to see, in-\nstead of the hermit's run-down cottage, a gorgeous palace. He was dismayed\nto find the same cottage there still, the only change being that it was in a more\ndilapidated state than ever. Dismounting from his horse, the prince burst\nthrough the cottage door and called out: 'O hermit, are you alive?'' The deep\n\n-sonorous voice-of the hermit responded: -''Indeed yes, Prince._Welcome-to-—. .-—...—\n\nmy humble home. \"\n\nWithout any delay for ceremony, the prince voiced his feelings: ''Whatever\nis the matter? What did you do with my philosophers’ stone? Why didn't you\nuse it to become rich?'' The hermit appeared to ponder a moment. Then he\nreplied: ''Well, well, what's all this about a stone? And about my becoming\nrich? I don't want to be any richer than Iam.\"\n\nThe prince was alarmed. Perhaps his prized philosophers' stone had\nbeen carelessly lost by the old hermit. ‘Don't you remember,\" he pleaded in\nagonized tones: ''the priceless philosophers' stone that you tucked beneath\nyour waistband a year ago? What have you done with it?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, now I remember all about that precious stone of yours, ' the\nhermit replied. 'I happened to be deeply immersed in the thought of Spirit as\nI went to bathe in the river one day, and I think the stone must have dropped\nout from my clothing then.\"\n\n\"I have lost everything!'' cried the prince, and fellin a swoon. The hermit\nbrought him back to consciousness by sprinkling cold water on his face. Mem-\nbers of the prince's retinue advanced menacingly toward the old man. But the\nhermit laughed. \"You Hydra-headed prince, I didn't think you would make\nsuch a fuss about a stone. Come along with me to the river and I'll search for\nit.\n"}

Don't make any more commotion until we have\nsearched the river bed.\"\n\nAs if under a strange spell, the prince and his retinue responded to the\nhermit's subtle spiritual magnetism; mutely they followed the saintly old man\ntothe river. There the hermit asked the prince to pull out his handkerchief.\n\"Hold its four corners with your hands,'\"' he instructed. ''Dip it in the water\nof the river and pray: 'O Prince of the Universe, maker of all precious stones,\ngive me back my philosophers' stone. 111\n\nAs the prince raised his handkerchief out of the water, he beheld in it with\namazed and unbelieving eyes two score of philosophers' stones exactly like the\none he had lost. Testing each stone he found that every one would convert into\ngold the ordinary stones onthe shore. Then the prince tied the two score gold-\nmaking stones in his handkerchief and threw them back into the river.\n\nThe hermit and the prince's retinue cried out: ''Why did you do that?\"\nThe prince turned to the saint, and with folded hands knelt at the old man's\nfeet. ''Honored Saint, I want to have what you have, that you regard gold-\nmaking stones as worthless pebbles. \" And so it was that the prince quit his\nearthly kingdom in order to learn from the wise old hermit how to acquire the\nimperishable kingdom of Spirit.\n\nThis story illustrates that earthly riches, no matter how valuable they\nmay seem to be, are perishable and have to be left behind after the body grows\ncold. Instead of using your philosophers' stone of gold-making business abili-\nty to acquire only perishable riches, be like the hermit who employed his time\nand ability to attain the imperishable riches of God. Having God, you will be\nwealthy beyond dreams, and, if necessary, willing to throw away millions in\nearthly money as easily as if they were pebbles, in order to enjoy the imper-\nishable riches of Spirit.\n\nKK\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nMy body is the universe and I am the astral breath\nthat enlivens all things in it.

During the first phases of creation, the cos-\nmos was composed of fine forces; heaven and earth were not yet made ९०६ mat-\nter. They had no dimensional form and were ''void, '' because God had creat-\ned them first in idea.\n\n\"And darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit (the intelli-\ngence) of God moved (vibrated) upon the face of the waters (elements existing\nonly as ideas or mental conceptions)'\"' (Genesis 1:2).\n\nThe word ''darkness'' as used in Genesis 1:2 has a special significance:\nit means duality or relativity. Just as the calm sea cannot be ruffled into\nmyriad waves without a storm, so also the sea of the one Spirit could not di-\nvide itself into manifold creation without the storm of the law of duality or\nrelativity, or darkness. God first created the heavenly electrical, thermal,\nand electronic forces, and all material laws and matter, in idea only, by the\nlaw of relativity of thought. He ruffled up His consciousness, or Oneness,\ninto waves--or countless ideas--by means of the storm of duality. This dual-\nity is maya, the ''measurer,'' which has the magical effect of causing the in-\nfinite Formless to appear divided:or ''measured\" into countless varieties of\nforms\n\n\"And God said (vibrated), Let there be light: and there was light'(Genesis\n1:3). The spiritual intelligence of God gently vibrated upon the elements cre-\nated thus far in idea only, and immediately after that God ''said,''i.e., vi-\nbrated, more eloquently, and those idea-created elements '\"'froze'' into the\ngrosser form of the one cosmic light or cosmic energy. The subtle force and\ngross elements of which earth's crust, stardust, human bodies--everything --\nare made, are but different rates of vibration of that one light, or conscious\ncosmic energy. Thus after having created all things in idea, God created\nthem astrally by vibrating them into light. The entire universe is made up of\nelectrons that are called energy or light.\n\n\"And God saw the light, that it was good'' (Genesis 1:4). God saw that He\ncould use that light for the creation He wanted to bring forth, hence the light is | ।\ncalled ''&००१. \"\n\n"}

And God called the light\nDay, and the darkness he called Night'' (Genesis 1:4, 5).\n\nGod saw that this light could be very serviceable in His work of creation.\nHe divided Himself into darkness and light; that is, one portion of Himself\nremained as the unmanifested Absolute, and another portion was manifested\nthroughout creation as the all-creating life energy.\n\nThe creation-making light was called by God ''day'' and the unmanifested\nportion of His existence was called ''night.'' These two phases--the unmani-\nfested state of His existence plus the manifested state of His existence, were\nestablished in a day, that is, a cycle of time consisting of perhaps millions\nof years. Most people misinterpret the word ''day'' to mean a man-made\nterrestrial day of twenty-four hours. As a result many otherwise intelligent\nlovers of the Christian Bible blindly assume that the earth was created in\nseven ordinary days, contradicting the definite findings of the earth's age\nwritten on the pages of its strata and buried flora and fauna. God took a whole\ncycle even to create the universe in idea and vibrate it into luminous subtle\nenergy. Everything about the universe shows that God took time to think it\n\nover before He created anything.\n\n\"And the evening and the morning were the first day (cycle)'(Genesis 1:5).\n\"Evening\" means the period of mental creation, an \"morning'' means the\nperiod of astral creation. The \"first day'' means the first cycle, consisting of\nthe millions of years taken by God to plan this creation in idea and then create\nit astrally in light.\n\n\"And God said (vibrated),. Let there be a firmament in the midst of the\nwaters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firma-\nment, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters\nwhich were above the firmament; and it was. 5011 (Genesis 1:6, 7).\n\n\"Firmament'' means space; behind it -hideall the finer forces. Spaceisa\ndistinct ae It separates the astral from the physical. For example,\nmillions of angels may be moving about us, but we cannot see them because\nour gross eyes are unable to register such high vibrations; therefore space\nmay be said to hide them from us. All sounds are moving in space; we do not\nhear all of them. Yet if you have a radio you will be able to hear through it\nmany of the songs and voices moving through space.\n\n'Waters'' means elements; the astral elements were divided from the gross\nelements below by the firmament (space). So, we are actually below space,\nand above space is the land of the gods.\n\nThe boundary line between heaven and earth is space. First space and all\nthe finer forces were formed; and then the waters or elements of the astral\nuniverse and the gross universe, which are merely different rates of vibration.\n\n"}

If for twenty years your eyes were closed and then\nyou suddenly could see, everything would appear to’ be flat; you would have lost\nthe power to see the third dimension, and would have the two-dimensional\n\nsight of the lower animals. This has been proven. Similarly, space is another\ndimension; it is the pearly gate of heaven. But it remains invisible to ordinary\nphysical sight. The spiritual eye that you see if you meditate deeply is alsoa\nmanifestation of the pearly gate. Your wisdom must pass through the star in\nthe spiritual eye in order to behold the other world--the astral world.\n\nSo God by His almighty will caused a grosser vibration (God ''said\") and\ncreated the ineffably sheer yet opaque rampart of space or firmament in the\nmidst of, 1. €. , separating, the astral and physical elements. This firmament\nsubtly separates the inner finer forces and the outer gross material substances.\nGod called the firmament heaven; it encompasses within its boundary the terri-\ntory of subtle electronic rays, different states of consciousness, angels, radio\nmessages, and so forth. Within the walls of this space lie also the earth and `\nthe sun's other planets, luminaries visible to our eyes. Of course, this space\nis interpreted according to the limitations of our senses; that is why we cannot\nbehold the finer vibrations of the subtle elements of matter. The Cosmic Light\nwas divided into fine elements and gross elements through the medium of inter-\nvening space.\n\nWe are making inroads into heaven, the receptacle of subtle forces, by the\ndiscovery of radio and electricity.

We have pulled electricity out of heaven\nand are making use of it on earth. । ~\n\nHow beautifully and unequivocally space is spoken ०1. 28 dividing the sub-\ntle elements from the gross elements, or waters! This interpretation is cor-\nrect; a literal interpretation, having the firmament divide two masses of water,\nwould be absurd. The gross forces were under the firmament. To create the\nfirmament took another cycle of many, many years, or a \"day''--that certain\nperiod required for a particular manifestation of God's consciousness. All\nthese manifestations were witnessed by the manifested and unmanifested con-\n\nsciousness of God.\n\nIf our ears were attuned, we could hear the earth moving through space.\nAll creation is producing myriad kinds of music.

And matter is on the outer surface of this wall of heaven.\nThat is why Jesus said: 'Seeing, ye see not; hearing, ye hear not.\"\n\nThe superconscious mind can penetrate space through the spiritual eye,\nand can see that the universe is really limitless.

''The second day'' is the second cycle, during\nwhich God created the fine astral and the grosser physical expressions of cos-\nmic energy or vibration.\n\n\"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto\none place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so'''(Genesis 1:9).\n\nThe elements (waters) of earth, water, fire, and air, and ether were\ngathered together under the firmament (space, heaven) and composed them-\nselves into the ninety-odd elements of the physical universe (dry land). Thus\nthe physical cosmos came into being. God commanded His powers (the ele-\nments aforementioned) to combine into a solid earth, seeing that the dry land\nwould provide a good stage for a future drama to be played by living creatures.\n\nScientifically speaking we must remember that a ''day'' means a cycle of\nmillions of years.

Now the day orcycle starts. The dry land\ncame. The earth is held round the sun by a cord of light, by the sun's mag-\nnetism. First the waters (astral elements) were gathered together, then the\ndry land (physical elements) appeared. Science says, first came the elec-\ntrons, nebulae, ocean; then the dry land, vegetation, animals, and finally\nman. The Bible describes creation in this order:\n\n1) mental or causal creation;\n2) astral creation;\n3) material creation.\n\nThe waters (elements existing as yet only astrally as different forms of\nenergy) began to move and the intelligence of God began to play on them be-\ncause God wanted to express Himself on yet another plane, the physical. As\nHe concentrated on the astral elements they changed into forms expressing\nintelligence. Out of the physical element of water came dry land, and God\ncalled the dry land \"earth'' and the water ''seas. \"'\n\n` ` \"And God said (vibrated), Let the éarth bring forth grass, the herb yield- =\n\ning seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in it-\nself, upon the earth: and it was so'' (Genesis 1:11).\n\nThis bears out the theory of evolution, does it not? Vegetation came\nfirst, then vegetation mutated into animal life. The difference between organ-\nic and inorganic matter is entirely illusory. A piece of tin feels pleasure and\npain and it can be poisoned and even killed. Professor J. C. Bose of India\nproved through the use of delicate instruments that there is no fundamental\ndifference in the life force that flows into various forms.

God's harmony is everywhere and everything in the universe\nis related. Hence when God reached the point of creating the various forms\nof vegetation, He had already created the sun, moon, and stars; because\ngrass could not grow without sunlight.\n\n\"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and\nthe lesser light to rule the night: He made the stars 21501 (Genesis 1:16).\n\nThis refers to the creation of the sun and the moon--the sun to rule over\nthe day and the moon to rule over the night. God saw that the day would be\nused for activity and the night more for retirement in Spirit. The sun and\nmoon are positive and negative radiating forces; also, the moon represents\nthe mother aspect of God and the sun the father aspect.\n\n\"And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. And God said\n(vibrated), Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that\nhath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of\nheaven. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth,\nwhich the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged\nfowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good\" (Genesis 1:19, 20, 21). @\n\nAnd all these things God performed through His manifested and unmani-\nfested state, during another day or cycle. Then there manifested in the\nwaters amoebae, the first moving creatures, followed by other early forms\nof marine life. As these primeval creatures chased each other they began to\ndevelop fins; and when here and there the waters began to dry up, other types\nbegan to develop lungs. (In Australia today there is a \"lungfish\" which is able\nto exist in or out of water.)\n\nAs the evolutional drama of creation unfolded, the fins of some creatures\nbecame useless and atrophied; in their place wings began to develop (in the\ncourse of a few thousand generations). Any physical change vital to survival\n=, a modification of cell structure that eventually created the required\nbody part.\n\nScience also tells us that everything living came from water. The frog\nwas a fish in the beginning; then it evolved into a half land, half water creature\nwith legs.\n\n\"And the evening and the morning were the fifth day'' (Genesis 1:23). The\nfifth 'day'' or cycle was thus devoted to the evolution of animals.\n\n(To be continued)\n\n"}

The Infinite is like the ocean,\n\nwhich never changes its essential nature, though\nits waves are constantly varying its appearance.\n\nSpirit vibrated into matter; hence both Spirit and matter exist. But matter\ndoes not exist in the way that it appears to us--finite and divided into multifar-\nious forms. The seemingly solid physical universe exists only as an illusion.\nIt is as insubstantial as a mirage in the desert.\n\n\"In the beginning was the Word\" (John 1:1)--that is, Vibration, the first\nmanifestation of Spirit in the role of Creator. The Cosmic Vibration divides\nitself into three modes of creation:\n\n1) the ideational, whereby the cosmos exists solely as ideas (Genesis 1: 1);\n\n2) the astral, wherein idea vibrations condense and separate into grosser\nmanifestations of light and energy; and\n\n3) the separation of these astral vibrations into an astral cosmos of sub-\ntle light and energy and the gross physical cosmos whose basic ele-\nments are ether, air, fire, water, and earth (Genesis 1:7).\n\nThe terse summations in Genesis of whole cycles of evolution are more\nunderstandable when studied in conjunction with the interpretations of the Hindu\nscriptures. Physical creation, according to the Hindu scriptures, has five\nkoshas or stages of evolution, through which all matter has to pass in order to\nbecome spiritualized and emancipated. It is part of the drama of creation that\nthe soul, a tiny spark of Spirit, goes through all these processes before becom-\ning reunited with the Infinite. God is said to sleep inthe dry earth, dream in\nthe herbs, awaken in animals, and, in man, to know that he is awake. Inthe\nenlightened man He regains His lost omnipresence.\n\nIn the second day (or cycle) the light was divided into subtle and gross ele-\nments. In the third cycle dry land and herbs came; in the fourth cycle plane-\ntary interrelations were definitely settled. In the fifth cycle the fishes, birds,\nand beasts were created. And in the sixth day (or cycle) man was created.\n\nLET US MAKE MAN And God said: ''Let us make man in our image, after\nIN OUR IMAGE our likeness\" (Genesis 1:26).\n\n"}

Why didn't God say: ''Let\nMe make man in My image''?\n\nThe following illustration will help you to visualize the deep explanations\nfrom the Hindu scriptures that are being given in this lesson. Suppose a man\nwishes to create a house. He creates it first in idea; that is, he has the idea\nof building. To carry out and supplement his idea for the house he calls togeth-\ner architects, engineers, building contractors, and so on. They do the actual\nwork of bringing his original idea into manifestation.\n\nSimilarly, God separates His Cosmic Consciousness (out of which the idea\nof creation was conceived) into seven subjective forms of consciousness--His\narchitects and builders who carry out His idea of creation, producing the cos-\nmos and, eventually, man. When God said, 'Let us make man in our image, ''\nHe was expressing or vibrating the desire to create man according to images\nand plans evolved by His subjective offspring--differentiations of His conscious-\nness--that act as His agents in creating and controlling different departments\nof creation.\n\nWhen Spirit decided to create, Its Cosmic Consciousness put on the aspect\nof:\n1) God the Father existing beyond creation;\n\n` ~: 2) Christ Consciousness, the only begotten Son (or reflection of\nthe intelligence of God the Father present in an undisturbed\nstate throughout creation); and\n\n3) the Holy Ghost or Cosmic Intelligent Vibration, the active,\nobjectifying creative power that structures all creation.\n\nThe Cosmic Consciousness of God present in the universe in an undisturbed\nstate is called Kutastha Chaitanya, or Christ Consciousness.\n\nThe Christ Intelligence separates itself into six subjective reflections of\nCosmic Consciousness; and the Holy Ghost separates itself into six objective\n3 stations of the Christ Intelligence. The Christ Intelligence and its six\nsubjective reflections are ''the seven spirits which are before his throne\"\ndescribed by St. John (Revelation 1:4).\n\nThe Holy Ghost Vibration or Aum created six objectifications or outward\nmanifestations of the Christ Intelligence: an ideational cosmos, an astral cos-\nmos,and a physical cosmos; and their epitomes in man--the ideational body,\nthe astral body, and the physical body.\n\nThe six objective creations may be classified as one--the Holy Ghost--\ngoverned by the supreme Christ Consciousness (in whom the six subjective\nreflections of the Cosmic Consciousness of God the Father become one).

Ina more detailed way it can be said that the fifty states\n\nof America are governed by the President and his Cabinet and Congress; so it\n\ncan be said that the vibratory creation of the various planes (macrocosmic and\n\nmicrocosmic) is ruled by the Father, Son, Holy Ghost, and six Intelligences\n\nor cosmic reflections of Christ Consciousness.\n\nIn order to understand America, one should understand its form of govern-\nment. Likewise, in order to understand the so-called mysterious universe,\none must know how it is governed by God and His seven reflections or ''seven\nspirits before his throne. '' The Cosmos works according to a definite plan.\nGod divided Himself into many cosmic personalities who work out and govern\nthe details of creation. Thus were planets laid out in space, and electrically\ncontrolled. The lighting, heating, seasons, and system of governing the inhab-\nitants of the cosmos were definitely planned and carried out by God and His\nseven angels (Christ Consciousness and its six intelligent reflections acting\nthrough the Holy Ghost).\n\nYou should now have a clear idea of the functions of these entities who gov-\nern the universe.

From the ideational universe they pour ideas into the\nsuperconsciousness and causal or ideational body of man.

As a dream-\ner realizes on waking that his dream and the objects and persons in the dream\nare all one and the same dream-stuff, so mortal man, by waking up in ecstasy,\nrealizes that Spirit, Its cosmic consciousness and Its manifestations of a cos-\nmic dream universe are made of one Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nSo man has descended into the cosmic dream delusion by countless various\nsteps and habits born of experience. In order to reascend to Spirit, he must\npull his soul away from material objects of attraction, body consciousness, the\nsenses, the subconsciousness, and the superconsciousness; that is, from the\nphysical, astral, and ideational consciousness; finally passing above the six\nobjective spheres and into the perception of his soul and the six deities present\nin his diminutive ideational, astral, and physical bodies and his macrocosmic\nbodies of the cosmic ideational, astral, and physical spheres.

The indi-\n\nvidualized Spirit, or soul, sustained the bodies of the\noriginal man and woman. Man and woman are the two natures of God--reason\nand feeling--expressed in different bodies. Spirit is knowledge plus feeling.\nWhen He divided Himself as God and Nature, man and woman, He found both\ndualities manifesting the same qualities, so He conceived a clever plan. In man\nHe kept reason uppermost, and feeling hidden; and in woman feeling uppermost\nand reason less prominent.\n\nReason is that which tells you the kind of flower, the color, the shape, and\nso forth; but feeling expresses love for and enjoyment of the flower. Do you see?\nGod is wisdom and He enjoys His wisdom. God is feeling and reason--male and\nfemale. Woman expresses more feeling in her behavior, appearance, and inter-\nests, and man expresses more reason. While man is the positive aspect and\nwoman is the negative, when compared to God we all are negative and God is\nthe one positive force. We can balance the positive and the negative tendencies\nin us by contacting God. That balance comes only from God.\n\nThe relative differences in the two above-mentioned qualities and in sex\nkept man and woman separate and different, but God had given them the power\nto commune with Him in spite of this dual consciousness. He placed them in\nheaven. In the original plan of creation, man and woman, ideal soul mates,\nwere to lead a heavenly life by keeping their minds in the heavenly region of\nBliss-Will in the forehead. The spiritual marriage consisted in woman (or feel-\ning) uniting with man (or the masculine force of knowledge) and thus becoming\none in God. `\n\nSTORY TOLD \"The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there\nIN GENESIS he put the man whom he had formed\" (Genesis 2:8). Eastward\n\nrefers to the place between the eyebrows where the sun of the\nheavenly eye is seen. Man's consciousness originally remained in that center,\nwhich is in the East (or front side of him).\n\n\"The tree of life...in the midst of the garden\" (Genesis 2:9) refers to the\n\n"}

A human being is like\nan upturned tree: the hair and the cranial nerves are the roots, the spinal cord\nis the trunk, and the afferent and efferent nerves ramifying from them are the\nbranches.\n\n\"And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will\nmake him an help meet for him'' (Genesis 2:18). The first sentence means that\nit did not fit in with God's plans of creation that man should be alone. Help\nmeet means a soul mate or the other half of man, who would help him eventual-\nly to liberate himself from the state of human existence. Ideal marriage was\nmeant to help lead toward liberation.\n\n\"And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept:\n| | he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof\" (Genesis\n2:21). He slept means that Adam, through the power of Avidya (individual illu-\nsion as opposed to Maya, or universal illusion), found himself separated into\nman and woman. Man means God, and woman means Nature. These two are\nequal in power and divine expression. Rib means vibration. Woman is made\nfrom the vibration, or rib, of man, or God force; that is, first the knowledge\nof God created man, then His feeling coming out of His knowledge-nature-vibra-\ntion (or rib, of man) created woman. Here let us refer back to Genesis 1:27:\n\n_\"In the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.’ This.\n\npassage shows that previously God had simultaneously created the male and fe-\nmale. So we can safely conclude that Genesis 2:21 (above) describes in detail\nthe creation of man and especially of woman.\n\n\"And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees\nof the garden; But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,\nGod hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye 416\" (Gen-\nesis 3:2,3). Inthese verses, the serpent is the outgoing current of life energy\nstimulating sex expression. The garden is the human body, especially the cen-\nter of consciousness. Trees are various nervous systems. Fruit is sensation.\n\"Fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden''is, therefore, the fruit\nor sensation of sex which is situated in the middle of the body, embedded in the\ntree of sex nerves. Here die means to lose divine consciousness, through de-\nscending from his heavenly consciousness to sex consciousness on the day he\nindulged in physical union or physical marriage, deserting the heavenly union\nof knowledge and feeling in divine spiritual marriage, as was meant originally\nin God's plan of creation.\n\n\"And the eyes of them both were opened\" (Genesis 3:7)means that they con-\ncentrated upon their physical sight and had, henceforth, to depend upon their\ntwo physical eyes, not their single spiritual eye.\n\nThis human body is the Garden of Eden, where there are several trees, or\nnervous systems, bearing different kinds of fruits of the senses; that is, the\noptical, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactual nerve centers, bearing the\n"}

God told Adam and Eve to enjoy all the fruits of the senses which grow\nin the garden of the nervous system except the fruit of the nerve tree. of the cre-\native force situated in the middle of the bodily garden.\n\nThese things are also mentioned in the highest Hindu Scripture, the Bhaga-\nvad-Gita, where in Chapter 15, Verse 1, there is a reference to ''the tree with\nroots above and boughs beneath. \"'\n\nORIGIN OF This fruit of momentarily alluring touch sensation is spoken\nSEX CREATION - of as the apple. The serpent is the life energy which stimu-\n\nlates the nerves of the creative force. It is this coiled 8615५\npentinelike energy at the base of the spine which rouses the negative feminine\ninstinct of feeling (or Eve) in man, to experience the conjugal mode of creation\n(eating apple). This feminine Eve-feeling tempts the faculty of reason (or Adam)\nin man to plunge into conjugal experience. The creative instinct is first roused\nby the life force accumulating in the lower spinal centers and sex organs asa.\nresult of physical thoughts and stimuli;.then feeling, or emotion, is awakened\nand overpowers reason. This creative nerve force which flows through a coiled\npassage in the coccyx is called the Kundalini power in Hindu books. This Kunda-\nlini power when concentrated in the lower spinal centers stimulates the creative\nurge--ordinary mortal consciousness. Through meditation, spiritual thoughts\nand right action, the Kundalini force is raised to the higher spinal centers,\nbringing divine perceptions and spiritual consciousness.\n\nEven as God had created the first beings by special creation, and not by the\nlaw of cause and effect through parents, Adam and Eve were empowered to cre-\nate children after their hearts' tendency by materializing, the life force into a\nbody by the immaculate method. Children could not be brought into being on\nearth if parents had not been created first, so the first parents were created by\nGod. :\n\nWhen man, instead of keeping his consciousness onthe Paradise spot in the\nregion of pure thought in the brain and at the point between the eyebrows (Christ\nCenter), allowed the mind to run down to the sex plane, he fell--that is, he\nchanged from being able to perform immaculate creation by will, to the method\nof physically propagating the species. _\n\nAll children are born and nurtured in the paradise of peace,, purity and bliss\nuntil they are tempted by the creative serpent force and begin to live on the pro-\ncreating plane. Then begins worry, weakness, jealousy, boredom, and an\ninfinite variety of ills. The idea is, that unless the sex instinct is controlled\nand moderated, young men and women will be driven from the paradise of happi-\nness which accompanies a life of self-control and moderation. Love, pure love,\nmust be predominant. If any man or woman could remain in the sphere of\nthought and lofty ideals--constantly busy with noble ideas, enjoying good music,\npictures, good food, and fragrant blossoms--and could refrain from getting\nmixed up with the.sense of touch involved in material procreation, they would be\n\n"}

This\nsaintly man, named Kumar, loved his wife, but he loved God more than her or\nanything else. In fact, he had married in order to discover whether his love\nfor God was oa than his conjugal affection, and with the understanding that\nhe would leave his wife, and all possessions, if the love of God possessed him\nand he had an urge to leave all for the Lord's sake. He was continuously intro-\nspecting to discover whether he was loving anything else more than God. He\nthought: \"If at any time I weaken and begin to love anything more than God, I\nshall have to remove that obstacle. ''\n\nTime is a great trickster, and delusion is subtle and penetrating; so after\n__ 9 while Kumar went on a pilgrimage with his wife, who was about to give birth\n\nto a baby. Both he and his wife thought that the birth of the baby in the holy city\nof Varanasi (Banaras) would be auspicious, and be good for its future.\n\nOn the way, as they passed through the outskirts of a certain city, the wife\nwas stricken with labor pains. Kumar hastily took her into an old dilapidated,\ndeserted house. As the wife writhed in agony, she said to her husband: ''Saintly\none, promise me that you won't desert our newborn babe under a divine impulse,\nfor I feel that Iam going to die.\"\n\nKumar, although extremely touched by the words of his stricken wife, yet\nfelt that he was between two fires--the child to be born and his paramount love\nfor God. He thought to himself: 'I could not love my wife or the baby unless\nGod made them lovable and gave them to me to love with the very love which\ncame from Him.'' He therefore determined, ''No matter what happens, I must\nnever let anything come in the way of my love for the Divine, and I must forsake\nanything to appease my love-thirst for God.'' He resolved to cut off his hand or\npluck out his heart or his eye, or otherwise maim himself, and forsake every-\nthing if by so doing he would become worthy of God's love.\n\nAlthough he was inwardly resolved to forsake all for God, by way of consol-\ning his wife and not causing her any heartache, he replied to her repeated\nentreaties: \"I will see what Icando. Iwill try my utmost to carry out your\nwishes.\"\n\nBut hard are the tests of God and subtle are the ways of delusion. The wife\n\n"}

The baby was crying piteously, while lying near the dead\nmother and the stunned father, when there was a great rumble in the ether and\n\na light, burning the bush of all ignorance. A Presence possessed the distraught\n\nfather. He heard a voice say: ''Beloved, come to me. We will remain in the\n\necstasy of divine love in the caves of the Himalayas.\"\n\nKumar was shaken with the love of God on one hand, and the love of the\nhelpless baby on the other hand. But then he thought: \"I could not know what\nlove is, nor have the baby to love, without God's love; so, if I cannot forsake\neveryone--father, mother, wife and child--for God, Iam not worthy of पता.\nThinking this, he prayed: ''Lord, Master of my life, you could even take my\nlife away now, and I wouldn't be here to love or take care of this baby, so I must\nshow that my love for You is greater than my love for my baby. So now, Lord,\ntake care of the baby, as I must hasten to depart for the retreat of the Himala-\nyan caves, where I wish to commune with You. ''\n\nHis eyes suddenly turned toward the floor, and he saw a lizard give birth to\nan egg and silently slink away, leaving the egg behind her. The egg broke; a\ntiny lizard was born. It opened its mouth in hunger and suddenly a small insect\nflew into it. The little lizard then closed its mouth and, its hunger being satis-\nfied, began to move away toward a hiding place. Seeing this, Kumar thought:\nIf the Lord feeds the baby lizard, forsaken by its mother, He will also take care | ।\nof my baby forsaken by his parents.\n\nThinking this, in the deep ecstasy of God's love, he ran out of the house, all\nthe while hearing the cries of the baby. But his heart was shaken and his human\nlove suffocated him. He stood under a tree and prayed: \"1,070, although my\nlove for You is greater than my love for the child, You gave me a human heart\nand I feel worried about the motherless, fatherless, helpless baby. Lord, 1\nbeseech You, show me some sign by which I can know that my baby will be cared\nfor. 1।\n\nThe Lord's response was magically prompt. As Kumar had been praying,\nthe emperor's coach was approaching the deserted house. In it rode the barren\nempress. Attracted by the cries of the forsaken child, she bade the driver stop.\nShe stepped down from the carriage and entered the house. There she saw the\nchild lying by the side of its dead mother. Tenderly picking up the baby, the\nempress re-entered her coach and hastened back to her palace.\n\nLater, as Kumar loitered in the city for a day or two, he heard that the king\nand queen, having no children of their own, had adopted the foundling as their\nchild and successor to the throne. Then Kumar, much pleased, left the city to\nkeep his tryst with God in the Himalayan caves of Hindustan.\n\nLove God with all your heart and soul.

Is it medicine? And if. medicine\nheals, why doesn't it heal everybody? Medicine is not the source of healing;\nnor is healing due entirely to mind power. A certain amount of body prepara-\ntion is necessary for body healing. If you continually eat too many wrong\nfoods, you will die sooner than you should, even though you use medicine when\ndisease overtakes you. You should obey the laws of good health, for these are\nlaws of God, and you should obey all laws of God. Then, if you are sick and\nyou seek out someone who you believe can give you mental healing, and if you\nhave faith in him, he will be able to help you. If you believe in a doctor, go\nto a doctor. If you believe in a mental healer, goto a mental healer. But\nyou must believe, above all, in God who gave them both the power to heal.\n\nThe medical healer depends upon chemicals, but what is behind the chemicals?\nThe power of God. Nothing can operate without God's power. God's vibration\nis inthe medicine. Omit God and every remedy is rendered impotent.\n\nElectricity and rays will be the future medicine of the world. And when\nwe advance still further, thought will be the medicine. Potentially millions\nof volts of energy are right in your brain. Each gram of tissue contains im-\nmeasurable latent power, and this energy is present throughout your body.\nFrom just the tiny bit of protoplasm that is gathered by the third day in the\nembryo, all the bones and matter of the body are formed. Whena soul is to\nbe incarnated, the will and energy create a body for it. To give up the use\nof will power would mean to disconnect yourself from the Source of energy.\n\nWhen you work for God; when you realize, in meditation and conscious\ndreams, the Power that is within you, that talks to you through the blades of\ngrass and every nod of every leaf, then you know that you are not surrounded\nby death but by the immortal breath of God. But you forget your infinite na-\nture when you look at the limited surroundings of the material world. Be-\ncause you relate yourself to the world and its limitations, you think that you\nalso are limited.\n\nTHE TERROR OF DISEASE Why is disease soterrible? Because it pro-\n\nduces pain and death. Disease must be cast\nout from the body, mind, and the ignorance-cloaked soul. Disease is detri-\nmental not only to your material ambitions, but to your mental and spiritual\naspirations. You can't think of God while you are suffering with a headache,\nnor can you think of Him when you are being bombarded with bills, or when\nyour mind is haunted by jealousy, fear of death, or when you are at war with\nyourself.\n\n"}

Our bones\n@ are brittle and they break; mentally we suffer from melancholia and other\n\nmoods and fears; and spiritually we suffer from ignorance of our immortal\nsoul nature. So we can classify all diseases in three ways: (1) physical dis-\neases born of bacteria, transgressions against the body, accidents, etc.; (2)\nmental diseases born of mental weaknesses such as fears, worries, and other\nwrong habits of thinking; and (3) the greatest of all diseases--spiritual igno-\nrance--unawareness of one's own soul.\n\nIt is your duty to clean out the bacteria from your bodily temple. There\nare many and various ways to do this, for which I bow my head to the great\ndoctors and the great scientists; and to the saints who have been the instru-\nments of mental healings. When seeking health, one of the first rules is to\noutlaw counteracting thoughts and actions. Stop those actions that create the\ndisease in you.\n\nThe saints and sages of India have shown that the divine Power works in\na practical way, provided you have really established communion with It. What\nis the way? How shall you reach the unlimited power of God? How tune your\nmental radio with the divine harmony that de stroys all disease and lets the\ncosmic vibration of God pass through?\n\nFind God!

Bring His energy into your body by affirmations such as this:\n\"God is in my. mind; I am healed. \"'\n\nSpiritual ignorance is the root cause of all suffering. Remember this: if\nyou heal yourself of soul ignorance, you will have healed body, mind and spir-\nit. Always remember that as a student of these teachings you are much more\nfortunate than many other persons. Knowing the laws of truth, you have it\nwithin your power to obliterate diseases and make yourself what you want to\nbe.\n\nCheerfulness is very important to health. It is the best antiseptic that\nyou can have--plus the thought that you are all right. But along with right\nthinking, you must live rightly. Do not be like those who fanatically think that\nthey are all right while at the same time indulging every day in wrong habits\n\nof living.\nVARIOUS TYPES The human body is a bundle of nerves. They are like\nOF NERVOUSNESS little tubes through which you drink in impressions of\n\nthe material world about you. But the nerves are not\nmeant to bring you only physical sensations; they are meant also to enable\nyou to imbibe the eternal nectar of God. You have a bundle of nerves in the\n@ ears, eyes, and in every organ of sense. Howare you using them? Most\npeople absorb through their nervous systems only mundane sensations.\n"}

You have your individual likes\nand dislikes. You believe that you like this or that. In Mexico there is a gen-\neral predilection for chilies; in India people enjoy curries. Each nationality\nhas some special desires, owing to mass tendencies of nerve response or\nnervousness. Nervousness does not necessarily mean restlessness; it also\nmeans using or responding to certain sets of sensations produced by the nerves.\nAny sensation that controls you is deadly. Let no sensation in your body con-\ntrol you.\n\nPeace and harmony are necessary to maintain health. OM, the holiest of\nall sounds, is a soothing sound. Inharmonious noise creates nervousness and\ndisease. People would live longer if they did not have so much noise about\nthem.\n\nThere is another form of nervousness--spiritual nervousness. The soul\nis so identified with the body that it has quite forgotten its real nature. You\nare so identified with your nerves that you think of yourself only as a mental-\nly and physically sensate creature. Even thoughts are but sensibilities that\ncluster around your soul. ।\n\nPhysiological nervousness can be destroyed by eating more fruits, and\nother wholesome foods; and by not overeating. And mental nervousness can\nbe destroyed by reading good books, cultivating good company and good\nthoughts, and so forth. Spiritual nervousness can be destroyed only by medi-\ntation. That means transferring the attention from the nerves to the percep-\ntion of infinite Joy. Don't live just in this little cage of the body. Your real\nSelf is in the cage and also outside the cage. When you know your true Self\nyou will find that you think through all minds, feel through all hearts, work\nthrough all hands. This Self is real.\n\nMeditation means transferring your attention from the bundle of sensa-\ntions that is your body to the Infinite Joy that is your true Self. Every night\nLs takes your attention away from these nerve tubes and makes you forget\nall the sensibilities of the body. Meditation, practiced in the right way--in\nthe way that you have been taught in these Self-Realization Lessons--is very\nimportant. Lift your consciousness from mortal nervousness. Those who\nremain in the consciousness of the Self do not feel any sensation in the body.\nIf you meditate, you will feel that behind your muscular power there isa\ngreater Power; that you are no longer merely a weak individual. But as soon\nas the nerves are allowed to control the mind, your soul is in the ego state\nof physical identification, and in that state is controlled by the nerves and\nmaterial sensations. Thus you produce, intime, the miseries that go with\nmaterial things.\n\nMany people are clothes conscious, nerve-bound, and appetite -bound;\n\n"}

You are really infinite electricity.\nYou are immortal. You cannot be killed by anything. You are Infinite Limit-\n\nlessness throbbing behind this body. You are a child of the Infinite. So do not\nallow a little nervousness to bother you. Never think of yourself as a man or\na woman. You are the Infinite. You are the electricity in the bulb of flesh,\nyou are not the bulb. The electricity goes back into the dynamo when the bulb\nis gone.

Then all good things--health, happiness, abundance--\nwill be added unto you as a part of your divine birthright. We are all prodi-\ngal sons, having run away from our Heavenly Father. Only when we reunite\n\n। त our souls with Him do we regain all He had givenus, His divine children, as\nहे part of our heritage. Seek prosperity with God's consciousnéss of all-supply,\nbut seek God first.\n\nA man only acquires prosperity, happiness, and abundance as it 18 mea-\nsured out to him by the cosmic law according to his past actions and the de-\nvelopment of his brain capacity; that is why so many people do not get the\nthings for which they pray. No one can acquire anything that he does not de-\nserve to receive. Why then pray and visualize in the wrong way? Pray no\nlonger as a prodigal son of God, but as a divine child united with the Heavenly\nFather.\n\nTHE MAN WITH THE NERVOUS HEART\n\nSometime ago a man suffering from a chronic nervous condition of the\nheart came to me for healing. He explained: '' I have tried many things, but\nIam unable to get rid of my heart trouble. 1 After calm, intuitive reflection\nItold him to bring me a pair of scissors. He looked alarmed. ''Sir, are you\ngoing to perform an incision on my heart?\" I laughed and replied: \"I am not\na doctor, and you have never heard of anyone using scissors for operating\nupon the heart. \"\n\nAt last, when he reluctantly brought the scissors, I cut off one of his vest\n© buttons and told him not to sew another one inthe place of the missing one,\nand not to put his hand on the place where the missing button belonged.

Therefore, will and energy are\nmost important--they are the real creators of the body.\n\nThoughts have to be understood and rightly applied before they can be\neffective. They come to you in crude forms. People who try to employ crude\nthoughts without understanding get no results. Then they say that thoughtsare\nnot effective. Crude thoughts must be distilled before they can be effective.\nA distilled thought is one that has been chemicalized by soul force--without\nthat soul force it has no value. |\n\nIf you affirm, \"I am well,\" but in the background of your.mind hold the\nthought that it isn't so, the effect is the same as if you had taken a helpful med-\nicine and at the same time swallowed poison, counteracting the good effect of\nthe medicine. In using thought as a medicine you should be very careful not\nto neutralize good thoughts by wrong thoughts. Otherwise you cannot heal your-\nself.\n\nTo be active and successful, a thought must be impregnated with such\nwill power that it will resist every opposition. Thought must be materialized\nin order to be fully effective, and this can only be done through will power.\n\nIf you tune in with the mental vibrations emanating from the Prayer Council\nat Self-Realization Fellowship headquarters, no matter where you are, you\nwill feel the vibration of healing. It is traveling through all soundless (to the\nphysical ear) vibrations direct to you. This is telepathic healing. It is also\nvery effective when a group concentrates and continuously sends healing men-\ntally, visualizing the healing power flowing into the mind of the patient.\n\nYou can use autosuggestion to restore your confidence and to strengthen\nyour will power.\n\nThe mind and body are wonderfully related. Many people can be healed @\njust by suggestion, and many can be made ill by suggesting sickness to them.\nRemember, your mind has grown the different parts of your body. Itcontinues\n\n"}

Jesus un-\nderstood the principle. You may believe in this, but in order to send effective\nhealing thoughts to others you must know how to materialize thoughts in some\nform. Unless you prepare yourself, you will lose faith in mind power. Your\nthought should be developed enough so that it can be active.\n\nWILL POWER--STRONG No negative influence should be permitted to\nFACTOR IN HEALING weaken the will. Will power is your savior, and\n\nsalvation is no lazy man's job. It is for those\nwho have made up their minds that nothing can prevent them from realizing\nwhat they are--deathless souls.\n\nWill controls the energy inthe body. It is not the will that heals; but will\nrouses energy, which is the cause of healing. There is no force more effec-\ntive than energy applied by will power. Will and energy are the two most ef-\nfective powers in the system.\n\nIf you develop your will power you can then develop healing power, but do\nnot try to heal those who doubt you. Those who ask your help must have faith\ntheir will is not-tuned in with yours. If your will did not\nfunction, your ambition would be cut off and you would pine away. So if you\nwant to be a success, never cease cultivating the will. Do not become dis-\ncouraged at temporary failures; then you will see the power of a persistent\nwill. It is all right to try to heal the body, but do not forget to heal the soul\nalso. True healing must take the person straight to God--you must first real-\nize the soul's identity with Him. When you thus heal the soul of ignorance of\nits own divine nature, the body will be healed automatically.\n\nNECESSARY PREPARATION In healing it is necessary to remember that\nFOR HEALING the body is only controlled energy. The\n\nsame force, will, that governs the body keeps\nthe atoms of the earth together. You must have faith, which is more than\nmere belief. Will is motivated by faith, but not by belief, because a belief\ncan be contradicted by a contrary phenomenon. Faith is the proof of the exis-\ntence of things unseen. Knowing and believing are different qualities. Faith\n18 'knowing'' through intuitive perception, which occurs when you are one with\nTruth. What you perceive through your senses you can know about through\nyour intelligence and senses; but how do you know God? He is seen only through\nthe eye of intuition. Real faith is rooted in intuitive realization of Truth or God.\n\nIn healing you must first consider the seed and the ground. The seed is\n@ the will power of the healer; the ground is the faith of the person to be healed.\nUnless that person is receptive you will find that it is almost impossible to do\nanything. You may broadcast a sound to a distant place, but if there is no\n\n"}

The broadcasting power of the healer plus the\nreceptivity of the person to be healed are both necessary. Seeds do not germi-\nnate on stones, nor can good ground produce plants without good seeds. So it\nis necessary first to put the patient into a receptive mood. Then till the mind\nwith the plow of reason, for the ground is hard. When the ground is soft,\n\nplant the seeds of faith, and water them with your divinely attuned will.\n\nSuggestions of disease and heredity have a terribly discouraging influence\nupon the will of man. Simply saying that will brings energy is not enough. You\nmust feel that energy. Willis avery strong factor. The direct source of en-\nergy is reached through will power, and therefore this will must not be dis-\ncouraged by wrong suggestions. That is why it is always good to keep company\nwith those who have strong wills. Your will, when guided by wisdom, is God's\nwill.\n\nConcentrate with utmost faith, and make your will a bridge with the divine\nwill. Go on willing the patient to be cured, by thinking that God's healing en-\nergy, conveyed by your will, is running through his forehead, down his spine,\nand through his body to the center of the affected area. Do not doubt; do not\nbe curious as to whether the person is cured. Just believe, send forth the heal-\ning power, and forget. Do not talk about your efforts or results to skeptics.\nNever say: \"I cured.'' Always think that the divine will, acting through your\nhuman will, cured the disease. Give the whole credit to God's healing power\nand divine energy.\n\nHEAL BY DIVINE WLL The energy projected by God to bring forth crea-\ntion is here termed divine will. Human will isa\nmicrocosmic aspect of divine will. Divine will is omnipresent, residing in\nevery unit of cosmic energy, Or universal prana. Divine will has creative\npower as well as sustaining power. Disintegration of cosmic energy atoms\nis constantly taking place in the universe, owing to the constant flux and in-\nflux motions of maya (the delusive force of repulsion that repels all creation\nfrom its Source). Yet the great force of divine gravitation is constantly pull-\ning all units of energy toward God as the center of everything (force of attrac-\ntion).\n\nThe maya-force, born of the divine will to create, constantly tries to\nkeep creation in existence by the law of repulsion. The collision between the\ncreative force of maya, and the divine gravitational force toward God causes\ninharmony inthe universe. One of the manifestations of this inharmony is\ncalled disease. Owing to this disease, or inharmony of soul and body, we are\nisolated from God. Hence, ''disease'' is anything that keeps us from God-\nrealization. To harmonize the maya repulsive force projecting outward, and\nthe divine attractive force drawing inward, can be termed \"healing. '' Hence,\ndisease of body, mind, and soul ought to be divinely treated.\n\nGod works through will. The human soul is the reflection of God. The\nhuman will is the reflection of divine will. Human will is limited in power.\n\n"}

That is why you\nshould follow the truths you have been taught in these lessons. You must real-\nize what you are: a spark of the Divine Being.\n\nChange, though often welcome is not always sure to bring you happiness.\nOne of my first experiences in America showed me that American housekeepers\nare fond of moving things from one place to another: when I went to get a book\nfrom the place where I usually put it, it was gone. For me, at least, the\nchange was not good!\n\nThe more pointless or unwise changes you make, the more willbe your\ntroubles. Once ina while it is pleasant to swim in the ocean, but if you had to\nremain on its billowy surface your body would soon be shattered. Similarly,\nif you are constantly subject to the ups and downs of unnecessary changes, or\nchange for its own sake, you cannot be happy.\n\nThe body is of course conditioned to numerous necessary changes; for ex-\nample, with every step you take, three hundred muscles are put into action.\nThis motor mechanism, which causes the body movements, weighs eighty\npounds: sixty pounds of muscle and twenty pounds of bone. You use one hun-\ndred and forty-four muscles, besides the muscles of the motor mechanism, in\none movement of your arm or leg; and every one of these changes draws energy\nfrom the brain, the central storehouse of energy in the body.\n\nMost people naturally become tired from all these changes, because they\ndo not know how to keep the energy in the body. Yet energy is always present\nthere; indeed, the physical body lives on even after the soul's departure at\ndeath. If certain portions of the body were put on ice shortly after death, life\nwould remain present in them for many days. Nothing is ever really dead.\nThere is only a difference in rate of the vibrations of life. This difference in\nvibratory rate creates the opposite appearances we call life and death. You\nmust realize that the same form of life is present in both a living and a so-\ncalled dead body.\n\nBut why spend so much time looking after the little physical body? The\nphilosopher who understands the infinite nature of his soul is always smiling.\nIn wealth or poverty, health or sickness, life or death, know that you are one\nwith the Changeless Unborn.\n\n"}

Iam not a little mortal being with bones to break, a body that will\nperish. Iam the deathless, changeless Infinite. '' Do not construe this advice\n_to mean that you should not eat properly and look after the body's real needs.\nYou should take care of all your earthly responsibilities, but without becaning\nbound by them.\n\nOffer up to God the prayer that will really make you happy: the prayer to\nrealize the infinite nature of your soul. Do not allow your consciousness to be\nimprisoned in this mortal life. Make your consciousness expand till all the\nstars throb in your bosom; feel the boundless airs of space within your being,\nand stretch your muscles all studded with planets. Concentrate upon changeless-\nness, upon realization of your oneness with the Eternal. Day and night the or -\ndinary person is moody or happy, or pleased or indifferent; but no matter what\nhappens in your life, you should always be happy. Todo so you must get away\nfrom identification with changeful mortal life and reidentify your consciousness\nwith the changeless soul within you.\n\nIam showing you a greater way to freedom. Do not concentrate upon\nchange; and whatever comes to you in life, do not let it affect you. Polish the\ndiamond of soul consciousness, for that will go with you. Make your soul a\nreality in your life. The way of expansion of consciousness is not to be bothered\nby material changes. No matter what comes, be happy. Never worry about\n\n~what-you have or do not have. Constant change does not give you happiness.\n\nYou will notice that I always take you into the deepest regions of soul per-\nceptions, and bring you back, so that you can connect these depths of thought\nwith your own experience. I want to give you something tangible. I live in the\nsphere of tangible things, as you do; and I enjoy with divine soul-consciousness\neverything around me; for from the depths of spiritual perception I behold all\ncreation as immortal--as multifarious projections of God's thought.\n\nHOW THE BODY The body has several grades of changes: growth, reten-\nIS SUSTAINED tion, chemicalization, and disintegration. All these\n\nchanges in the body have to be maintained by food. When\nyou cannot eat you think that you will die, but that is not so. Anything that you\nthink you cannot do without, you should get rid of. Do not be bound by habits.\nYou are here on earth to learn to behave like an immortal and not to be too\ndefinitely identified with the world. You are neither man nor woman, but a\nsoul. You are above the need for food, if you would but realize it.\n\nYou should have a balanced diet, but you should not live entirely on the\nfood plane. You eat because your forefathers did. The body is best sustained\nby simple foods. Fruits are good for spiritualizing the body. Ido not mean\nthat you should not eat any protein; but those who eat too much protein and\nmeats will be kept on the sense plane. Too much food produces greed, which\nwill cause you to be thrown back to this plane of change. We must remember,\n\n"}

You are not dependent\nentirely upon food; and you will find that the farther you advance in the practice\nof these principles, the less you will need to depend upon food as a source of\nenergy. Your body is vitalized and fed directly by spiritual energy. That is\nwhy Jesus said: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that\nproceedeth out of the mouth of God.\"'\n\nRemember that your body in reality is a group of materialized thoughts.\nThe rays of the stars, all things, are but differentiations of God's thought. If\nyou tune in with the thought of God and hit the nail of delusion with the hammer\nof right thoughts of Truth, you can overcome delusion. Destroy all mortal\nthoughts by substituting a thought of immortality, suchas: 'I am everlasting\nyouth; 1am eternal joy.\"\n\nREALIZING TRUTH This truth has been sent to you so that you may real-\n\nize in your own consciousness that you can break the\nshackles of mortal limitations and be free. The time will come when your body\nwill. cease functioning; if only you can quicken your soul not to go back to the\nmaterial plane, there to be governed by material attractions, it can regain its\nnatural constituent of immortality, and release itself from the mortal con-\nsciousness of the earth plane.\n\nIf you saw life in only one form you would not see any death; indeed there\nwould be no death. So if you place your concentration on the vast Ocean of life,\nyou won't see the hundreds of millions of people who are living and dying. It\nis because your attention is on the change, and not on the Object that is causing\nthe change, that you are deluded. When you have a little trouble with the body,\nyou immediately fear that you are going to die. Fear of the change called\ndeath is the cause of untold human misery.\n\nIf everything about God had been told by the saints, nobody else would\nmake the necessary effort to know God. You must know Him yourself. Ali the\nsaints are here, even now. You can see them when you develop spiritually.\nThey are just as realto me as you are. So impregnate every cell of your body\nwith the thought of God, through meditation, work, right diet, good actions,\nand so forth. That is the way to immortality.\n\nIn God there is neither life nor death as we see it. Tne Ocean never dies.\nThe waves change, of course, but even they are immortal, because they are\nstill essentially part of the ocean, whether they remain as waves on its bosom\nor sink back into the deeps. So isthe human body, inthis sense, immortal.\nEverything is immortal; only the forms are mortal, i.e., changing. The form\nof man is always changing in essence.

In\nadream, the mind-plays the part of the material objects as well as the con-\nscious creatures in the dream.\n\nIn a dream, the mind materializes itself into the earth, sunlight, flowers,\nrivers, mountains, glens, oceans, sky, air, fire, ether, and water. In that\ndream setting of the earth, the mind materializes itself into sentient blossoms,\nsinging birds, and conscious human beings.\n\nWhile in a dream, you perceive the earth you walk on as different from\nwater in which you swim. You breathe the air, feel the heat of the sun, smell\nthe fragrance of flowers, feel cold and heat, have all kinds of sensations. In\na dream you can see a baby born, a person die, someone sick and someone\nए In a dream, you think, feel, will, hate, love, forgive, or are re-\nvengeful, or are happy or sad.\n\nWhile you are dreaming this dream-existence on this dream-earth, you\nrecognize the relative difference between solids, liquids, gases, water, air,\nether, fire, thought, feeling, will, sadness, joy, poverty, prosperity, health,\nsickness, birth, and death; but upon waking from this earth dream, you see no\ndifference between solids, liquids, gases, ether, thought, birth, death, dark-\nness, light, sadness, and happiness, for they are all only different rates of\nvibrating mind.

Through it I came to understand the relativity of human consciousness,\nand clearly perceived the unity of the Eternal Light behind the painful dualities\nof maya. The vision descended on me as I sat one morning in my little attic\nroom in Father's Gurpar Road home. For months the First World War had\nbeen raging in Europe; I had been reflecting sadly on the vast toll of death.\n\nAs I closed my eyes in meditation, my consciousness was suddenly trans-\nferred to the body of a captain in command of a battleship.

I\njumped into the water, together with the few sailors who had survived the ex-\nplosion.\n\nHeart pounding, I reached the shore safely. But alas! a stray bullet end-\ned its swift flight in my chest. I fell groaning to the ground. My whole body\nwas paralyzed, yet 1 was aware of possessing it as one is conscious of a leg\ngone to sleep.\n\n\"At last the mysterious footstep of Death has caught up with me,\" I thought.\nWith a final sigh, 1 was about to sink into unconsciousness when lo!

I rocked to\nand fro, inhaling and exhaling to assure myself that I was alive.

He separates electrons into different materi-\nal manifestations: flowers, trees, stars, and so forth. In every aspect of\nmatter is evidence of the originality, the orderly direction and control of that\nCosmic Intelligence. Oneness with God, far from being a negation of con-\nsciousness, is an expansion of consciousness. Broadly speaking, there are\nfour states of consciousness:\n\n1) the state of the ordinary man, in which he is aware only of the\nworld outside himself;\n\n2) the state in which the devotee becomes aware of the presence of\nGod within, by meditation and communion with the soul;\n\n3) the state of being able to behold God at will either in Nature or\nwithin oneself;\n\n4) the final state of unbroken oneness with God's consciousness\n\neverywhere--nirbikalpa samadhi.\n\nFour veils hide God from us: solids, liquids, gases, and light. Lift\nthose veils and find God everywhere, in everything.\nFORM THE To reach God, that is, to actually commune with Him, it is\nHABIT OF necessary to meditate. As soon as you take away the rip-\nMEDITATION ples of sensations from the lake of the mind, God's heavenly\n\nbliss bursts forth from the soul. His bliss is already there,\n\nbut it is hidden within you. The more you meditate the more you will feel the\nendless joy of God. As soon as the ripples of worldly desires cease to exist,\nthen you will see clearly His mooned face. Meditation brings proof of the\nexistence of God.\n\nForm the habit of meditation. It is the only way to find everlasting hap-\npiness of the soul; and when you have that, nothing else matters. The joy God\nhas implanted in the soul is more charming than all the lures of worldly temp-\ntation. That is why you should pray: ''Father, make me realize Thou art\nenchanting beyond any earthly temptation. \"'\n\nThe essential thing to remember is that scientific meditation means the\nwithdrawal of life current from the nerves. When you can do that, sensations\ncannot reach the brain to rouse perceptions and associated thoughts. Concen-\ntration and meditation both have two sides: disengaging your attention from\nobjects of disturbance, and putting it on one object at atime. In the beginning\nyou cannot make your attention stay on one thing. After you have attained that\nstate wherein you can control attention (dharana, the sixth of the eight steps\nof yoga described by Patanjali), you will find that you can accomplish much\n\n"}

It seems that the joy we seek is\nburied somewhere in our souls, and can be perceived only when we are calm\nand undisturbed by any desire. Desire is a condition of disturbance and un-\nrest of thoughts and feelings.\n\nTo illustrate with an example illustrate with an example:\n\nIf you have a pot of water and you disturb that water, you will not get\n\na clear image reflected in its disturbed surface.

But in discovering soul joy,\nyou will find that \"something else'' which you were seeking through the laby-\nrinthine ways of desires for false pleasures. You will never tire of this ever-\nnew joy of your soul, which is of God.\n\nMy Master said to me: ''You will tire of everything else but that joy. If\nyou can realize that God is with you every minute, the sparkling, bubbling,\nrefreshing spring of His joy will be yours. When you attain oneness with this\njoy in your soul, you know you are divine. ! The joy that is already within our-\nselves, we are seeking in possessions, fame, name, money, and position;\nand we don't find it. We perish in our outward efforts to find happiness.

Help me to train my\nsenses so that they may enjoy all good things. Teach me to enjoy\nearthly pleasures with Thy joy. Teach me to weave Thee into my\ndaily activities.\n\nHOW TO WEAVE GOD INTO YOUR DAILY LIFE\n\nOur aim should be to bring God into our national life, our social life, and\nour personal life to such an extent that we feel the spring of God's presence flow-\ning continually beneath the fountain of our existence. That should be the inten-\ntion of every seeker of Self-realization. The question then is how you may serve\nGod in your daily life.\n\nWHY DESIRE TO KNOW GOD? First of all it is necessary to understand why\n\nyou should want to know God. Those who don't\nunderstand say, ''See how many people there are who don't think of God at all and\nthey are getting along all right in the world.'' But are they? The greatest num-\nber of suicides is among the wealthy, who are ''getting along all right.'' The\ntrouble is that they use most of their time for the accumulation of money, think-\ning that it will give them everything they want. When it does not, they become\ndisillusioned. Many times I have gone someplace without money in my pocket, | ।\nbut the Heavenly Father has always supplied my needs.\n\nJesus said that if one leaves father, mother, and friends, for God, one shall\nhave a hundred times more, and persecution, perchance; but hereafter, everlast-\ning life. I have found that to be true. Everything that I forsook for Him has\nbeen given to me again in some form. And lam not waiting for everlasting life,\nbecause I feel it in every cell of my body and in every fiber of my thought, now.\nIam speaking of That which dreams the body--the eternal Spirit. That alone is\nreal.\n\nLike a child, you cry for so many things that you never will find. Why don't\nyou try crying and yearning for God? Of course, a mere show of devotion won't\ndo; He knows what you are thinking. But if you really cry for Him, the Lord\nwill come to you, sometime, without fail.\n\nEveryone of you, in your heart, has some strong desire. Some want to get\nmarried, others want money or jobs. Some want healing. Some want to fulfill\nartistic ambitions. Meanwhile, every day, life is creeping forward. What are\nyou doing besides wishing? Are you progressing spiritually or are you going\ntoward death? Analyze yourself.\n\nWHY SEEK GOD FIRST Again ask yourself: ''Why should finding God be my\ngreatest ambition?'' Because without Him you cannot\nfulfill any other ambition. Think of it! Perhaps you will say: ''Paramahansaji\n\n"}

Today we are busy with new inventions, new pursuits.\n\nThis is a practical world.'' The idea that God is not for this age is nottrue. I\nthought the same thing once, but I wish I could show you all the things I have\nsince learned. To him who says that it is not practical to think of God, I would\nreply: \"It is not practical to forget Him.\" If it were, there would not be so much\nsuffering endured in the world by those who have forgotten Him.\n\nOnly when you shall purge from your heart every other ambition except the\nambition to know God--when you shall say: \"(0 the throne of my ambition lies\nonly the desire for God''--only then shall you know Him. Ican show you that\nSpirit, without fail, if you will follow me and practice what I teach you. I prom-\nise you that, because Ihave found Him. But God does not wish those who know\nHim to use miracles to draw other children to Him; you must make your own\neffort to find Him.\n\nONLY ONE IS YOURS Those friends and relatives of whom you say, ''They\nare mine!\" shall be taken away from you. Seek Him\nwho gave you the power to think, the power to love. You wouldn't be able to think\nor love or gather knowledge without the power of God. Cultivate His acquaint-\nance. It is possible to know God just as well as you know your dearest friend.\nThat is the truth. Now you are thinking, ''Why don't you show Him to me?\" Well,\nif it were God's will that I should do so, I would; but He has decreed that you find\nHim for yourself. Ican only show you the path to follow and the techniques by\n@ which you can overcome obstacles. oe\n\nThose whom you think are your own, are yours because of the Divine Mother.\nWhen your mother or sister or wife says, ''Come and eat your dinner,\" it is the\nDivine Mother who has taken form to serve you. How much more you should love\nyour Divine Mother! So shy! She lets you think that your visible mother loves\nyou, while it is really Her love which is being expressed. Your human mother\ncould never have loved you if she were not an atom of the omnipresent Divine\nMother.\n\nSo it is with other relationships. It is the Heavenly Father that you see in\nthe mortal father. She whom you call ''My wife, my love, '' is not your wife. It\nis the Divine Spirit that has taken the form of the beloved to offer love unto you.\nHe whom you call your servant is not your servant. It is the Divine Spirit taking\nthe form of the servant to serve you. He whom you call your friend is not your\nfriend. It is the Divine Spirit expressing through your friend.\n\nThen why do you look up to God in the clouds? He is so near--so real. He\nreceives your kind thoughts and returns kindness and love through your compan-\nions. And so I feel His love and service through my disciples and students. Who\ngives me love, who gives me attention, who gives me service? Only God, through\nthem. What if God switched off the life current from these loved ones?

If you should die and be buried, and then be reborn\nin the house right next to your old one of the former incarnation, will your\nformer father and mother recognize you? No. But God knows and loves you\nthrough thousands of incarnations. To love any being without loving God is mean-\ningless, but to accept the love of family and friends as part of the love of God\nmakes it so real! In my heart Ilove everybody. Why? Because I see God in\nall. God is expressing Himself in the soil, in the metals, and in the flowers.\nGod calls to you and says, ''Right behind the petals 1 am hiding. '' God is right\nhere. Why do you think of the flower as apart from God? I see it as God--I see\nevery human being as God. If you have this realization you cannot dislike anyone.\nIf you once saw God in some form, or experienced Cosmic Consciousness for\neven a moment, then you would love everybody. It is a strange experience. It\nmakes you love everybody just as your own family.\n\nWhen I returned to India and saw the people among whom I was born, I could\nnot see that they were any different from anybody else. I thought I would find\nthat my family was my own, but it was not so. I saw that every person was my\nrelative. Ifelt that the whole world was mine. I did not exclude my family but\nI found that inside and outside the family circle the relationship was the same. It\nis a wonderful life when you have that expanded consciousness. Such joy comes\nto your heart in seeing people and in serving them. That is why you should love\nGod. It is because most people do not consciously serve Him that the world is\nfull of suffering.\n\nYou must realize that you came to this earth alone and you will leave it alone.\nThe only One who accompanies you is God. He is serving you all the time. God\nmade the sky and the sun and the moon--everything that we use in life, He made.\nThat is why you should love God. And when you die--when your family says good-\nbye and your nation and earth are left behind, then God alone is with you. Why\nshouldn't you love Him? God will be with you when all things else shall forsake\nyou, if you will only love Him now. Having Him you shall have eternal protection.\n\nHOW BIG IS YOUR FAMILY? In time you will learn that counting on the\n\n2 material world is folly. When, while\nvisiting India, I saw all the things that 1 ८६९५ to do, I was absolutely disillusioned.\nI couldn't find joy in those things any more. I went to my old school, and in my\nmind I could see all my old playmates. But the old friends were gone, and the\nnew students did not recognize me. Yet God had not failed me! I saw Him\neverywhere.\n\nPeople have married and lost their love. People have attained success, and\nthen lost their money. There is only disappointment in store for those who fol-\nlow such paths. So I forsook the way of the crowds, and in meditation tried to\nfind the answer to the mysteries of existence. Such joy I found, such happiness,\nsuch truth! You can taste it also.

What assurance, when\nyou see heaven open within yourself!\n\nFor there is a heaven, and it is composed of ''many mansions\" or astral\nplanes. Just as there are myriad sounds going on in the world, some of which\nwe can hear only by means of radio, so behind the ether of the conscious mind\nGod is hiding with all the saints. But you must tune in. Every restless thought\nis static. If your radio is out of order you cannot get the program of God. This,\nI have often told you. So practice the methods, don't just try them out. Why\nspend so much time on other things, which are useless? Why not try to know\nGod? That is really worthwhile to you. It is an injustice to God to imagine that\nHe planned life to be full of hunger, sickness, and disappointment.\n\nTIME AND EFFORT There are some who are trying to sell heaven just as if\nARE REQUIRED it were a patent medicine. They have the nerve to tell\nyou that you can find heaven in a few minutes. No one\ncan give you God Consciousness that way. If that had been possible, Jesus Christ\nwould have given it to everybody. Instead, he said, ''The harvest is plenteous\nbut the laborers are few.'' The harvest of spirituality is plenteous but few are\nthe laborers who make the effort to find that realization. Those who come and\ntell you that you can know God through some magic formula--and all this ina\nminute--lie to you. You cannot know about Him without your own effort, without\nexpanding your own meditative consciousness.\n\nSpiritual truth cannot be found by proxy. You have to use your own brain.\nOn the other hand, many seek but they don't find God because they have no one to\npoint out the way. But through faith in the Heavenly Father they will find the way.\nThe Heavenly Father is your eternal heritage. The kingdom of the Father is your\nown. You now know the way, and if you will but try you will succeed. By finding\nHim you can find everything.\n\nThe certificate of the Father's approval means everything, and in your con-\nsciousness you know whether or not you have that. And if you haven't reached\nHim consciously then you haven't found that, so beware of becoming self-satisfied.\nKeep seeking and you will find Him and obtain it. It is better to spend the flesh\nto buy Bliss in eternity than to enjoy the flesh and forget eternity. Everyone can\nfind God, and He is Bliss. How can you find Him? First of all you must con-\ntinually keep in mind the reasons you should seek God. Remember that money\ngives only temporary release, health gives only temporary joy. But when dis-\nease has come, and when doctors are of no further help, what do you feel? You\nrebel against the world then; and if you have not contacted God, you fear the time\nwhen you will drop into the unknown.\n\nYou may think, 'Well, If Jesus Christ was so great why doesn't he talk to\nme and advise me? If Krishna was so great why doesn't he appear any more?\"\nStill, in your heart, you know these Avatars didn't tell lies. Since they spoke of\nimmortal life they exist today.

Yet, many are\ndrunk with oblivion of truth, drunk with maya (delusion), drunk with sorrow.\nThe flesh is tender and weak. All these errors and frailties are yours. The only\nway to get rid of every suffering is to find God. So the first thing is to contin-\nually remind yourself of all the reasons you want God-realization. Jesus and\nother Avatars have said so, St. Francis said so, my Master said so, and lam\ntelling you: God is the only Reality.\n\nWhy do you so often insult God by your indifference? He who loves you--He\nwho never punishes you for forgetting Him, but gives you life just the same.\nInstead, while you are playing the part He has assigned you, try to gain His\nattention and approval.\n\nWAYS TO FIND HIM Self-Realization Fellowship teaches you the highest @\n\n. path. You have received in these Lessons concentra-\ntion and meditation techniques which, when practiced correctly and with ever-\ndeepening devotion, can surely lead you to God Consciousness. Therefore why\nmake life so complicated? Why not make life simple and try out my recipe for\nliving? Every night, before going to bed, meditate until you feel that your mind\nhas gone beyond the static of your thoughts. Yet even that is not enough. After\ninteriorizing the mind, then pour out your devotion. You must surrender your-\nself completely to God. Then suddenly you will feel, ''I've reached Him!'' A\ngreat light will appear, or suddenly you may see a figure, or be aware ofa\ndelightful fragrance, and then you will know that God has manifested. And not\nonly that, but you will better understand the meaning of everything that happens\nin your life. That is the proof of your experience. Or perhaps, while you are\nmeditating, peace will envelop you. Then if you keep on, suddenly all thoughts\nwill be gone and a great joy will come upon you. Some students give up before\nthey reach that state--millions of people don't even know of it. And beyond these\nstates there is even greater joy.\n\nNow I shall tell you another way by which you can find God. If you put aside\nall other desires you can find Him. Every day when you are walking or working\nor waking from sleep, have but one desire in your heart, to know Him. This\nwill not interfere with your duties; in fact, you will be able to perform them\nbetter.

You shall succeed.\nContinuous desire for Him will bring an answer.\n\nIt is also necessary to eradicate certain character faults before you can suc-\nceed. You can't love God and be unkind to your associates. You can't love God\nand be full of wrath. You must keep His commandments. And remember, above\nall, there is one which you must keep. Love God with all your heart. Most\npeople love God when they want something from Him. But no matter what you\nare doing you must think of Him and love Him with all your heart, and mind, and\nstrength. To love God with all your mind means to give Him your attention no\nmatter what you are doing. You must own your mind--that is, you must be able\nto govern your thoughts. You cannot give your mind to God unless you have\nlearned, through concentration, to bring your mind under your control.\n\nThen love God with all your strength--that is the most satisfactory way of\nall, and is where the techniques of Self-Realization Fellowship come in.

Until you have accomplished this, don't stop. Be seri-\nous about finding God. Through these teachings you will be able to find God if\nyou want to pay the price in perseverance and sacrifice. If you do this, you shall\n\n~—find that I have been truthful with you. For ठ have made the effort for a ककु;\n\nlong time, and I have traveled this path.

I have nothing to lose. Iam enthroned\nin perennial satisfaction.\n\n(+.\n\nOVERCOMING FEAR AND FAILURE THROUGH DETERMINATION\n\nFear is actually a mental poison, except when it is used as an antidote for\nrash recklessness. Then it serves as a spur to calm caution. Fear develops\na malignant magnetism by which it draws to itself the objects feared, just as\na magnet draws a piece of iron, and thus increases our miseries. Fear in-\ntensifies and magnifies our physical pain and mental agonies a hundredfold,\nand is destructive to the heart, nervous system, and brain. It paralyzes men-\ntal initiative, courage, judgment, common sense, will power, and the sense-\nto-avert-danger consciousness. Fear contaminates strong imagination and\nfeeling, and through them may so influence the subconscious mind as to com-\npletely vanquish the willing efforts of the conscious mind. Fear throws a\nveil on intuition, shrouding the almighty power of your natural confidence that\nsprings intuitively from the all-conquering soul.\n\nUPROOT FEAR AND Failures and successes remain deep-rooted in the\nFAILURE THOUGHTS three minds of one life--unless worked out by frui-\n\ntion or weeded out by wisdom. They keep accumu-\nlating, and at death travel beyond the grave and are carried into one's next\nlife as seed tendencies. Though generally hidden in the beginning of the new\nlife these seed tendencies from the past manifest themselves when favorable\ngerminating conditions arise. (All the successes and failures and troubles of\nmany, many lives are packed as seed tendencies in the brain through which\nyour present consciousness, subconsciousness, and superconsciousness are\nexpressing. )\n\nHundreds of ghosts of stubborn conscious, subconscious, and supercon-\nscious minds are silently standing behind the spectral gloom of your present\nthree minds, encouraging you with bursts of inspiration or discouraging you\nwith explosions of depression. This is the reason why so many people, in\nspite of conscious efforts, do not succeed as well as they want. Though sci-\nentists call these ''unchangeable, congenital, prenatal, hereditary tendencies, \"\nthis explanation is limiting and unsatisfying.\n\nWhen you are threatened with the possibility of injury, do not throttle\nyour all-producing inner machine of consciousness with mental fear. Rather,\nuse your fear as a stimulus to manipulate your inner machine of conscious-\nness to produce some mental device that will instantaneously remove the\ncause of fear. These mental devices to escape fear are so numerous that they | ।\n\n"}

Will power is the steam or motive pow-\ner that works the machine of activity.\n\nFear of failure or sickness is cultivated by turning over such thoughts in\nthe conscious mind until they become rooted in the subconscious and finally\nin the superconscious. Then the superconsciously and subconsciously rooted\nfear begins to germinate and fill the conscious mind with fear plants that are\nnot so easy to destroy as the original thought would have been, and these even-\ntually bear their poisonous, death-dealing fruits.\n\nIf you are unable to dislodge by conscious will a haunting fear of ill health\nor of failure, keep on diverting your attention by reading interesting books\nthat absorb your attention; or even indulge in harmless amusements. Then\nthe mind will forget to haunt itself with fear. Next make your mind take up\nthe shovels of different mental devices and dig out from the soil of your daily\nlife the root causes of failure and ill health.\n\nUproot them from within by forceful concentration upon courage, and by\nshifting your consciousness to the absolute peace of God within. When you are\n\n~“able psychologically to uproot the negative quality of fear, then divert your atten-~\n\ntion to getting busy on positive methods of acquiring prosperity and health.\n\nFEARLESSNESS-- Associate with healthy and prosperous people who\nA CARDINAL VIRTUE do not fear sickness or failure. There is a deep-\n\nseated karmic reason for chronic ill health and re-\npeated failures. Idlers do not succeed either, and the self-indulgent suffer\nfor their pleasure, as they gradually transform their bodies into pits of hid-\nden, hibernating disease germs. So avoid association with these types.\n\nTo an unseeing materialist, a disease might appear to be inherited--just\nthe result of a physical law of cause and effect, or hereditary contagion. A\nmedical doctor is heard to say that the father or grandfather had tuberculosis,\nand that is the reason that the son has it. Buta spiritual doctor, who traces\nthe deeper causes of chronic diseases and other apparently unjust suffering,\nfinds that certain so-called hereditary diseases are not transmitted from one\nto another because of physical or mechanical reasons. Rather, a disem-\nbodied soul carrying a tubercular tendency is attracted to a family where\nthere is tubercular infection.\n\nOf course, tuberculosis can be produced in a healthy body when there is\nno karmic tendency, by disregarding physical and hygienic laws. No person,\nhowever healthy, prosperous, or good can be sure of his behavior or future\nexperiences unless he has destroyed all the insidious germ seeds of wrong\n\n"}

Like\n\nsome physical diseases that eat into the system, the rootlike evil effects of\npast actions remain and spread, through the conscious, subconscious, and\nsuperconscious minds of not only one life, but many lives.\n\nDo not fear accidents or disease if you have had them once; rather fear\nto be afraid, for fear may bring repeated accidents or recurrent disease,\nwhereas fearlessness will in all probability avert them, or at least neutral-\nize their power.\n\nDEATH--DELIVERER Do not fear to die, for death is a deliverer. When\nNOT TYRANT death comes, the cause of fear will be removed.\n\nWhen suffering is intense, death delivers us from\nall pain and mental suffering. Death is the inner physical, mental, and\nspiritual anesthetic that relieves one from all pains for a period immediately\nfollowing mortality.\n\nKill fear by knowing that you are protected behind the battlements of God's\neternal presence whether you are in a castle or on the open battlefield of life,\nwhere bullets of trials are incessantly flying. His all-powerful rays can evap-\norate the menacing clouds of doomsday, calm the waves of trials, and keep\nyou safe even if you are tossing ona sea of suffering, or death is dancing at\nyour door. But remember, without God's protectim, your prosperity, health,\nand life are not safe, even though you are ina scientific, hygienic castle of\nopulence surrounded and made impregnable by trenches, and fortified by all\nthe fire-emitting guns of man.\n\nNo matter how impossible of accomplishment his objective may appear,\nthe man of volition never stops repeating conscious acts of determination as\nlong as he lives. The evolution of this great force should be carefully studied.\n\nWhen fear comes, tense and relax; exhale several times. Switch on the\nelectricity of calmness and nonchalance. Let your whole mental machinery\nwake up and actively hum with the vibration of will. Then harness the power\nof will to the cogwheels of fearless caution and continuous good judgment,\nwhich in turn must be made to revolve continuously and produce mental de-\nvices for escaping your specific impending calamity.\n\nSHORT STORY OF SUCCESS\n\nThere are some people who go from one job to another without becoming\ninterested in any. That is not the way to success. You must choose the work\nthat you want and then go after it. One day a man came to me and said that he\ncouldn't seem to get ahead. I said: 'Do your work so well that your employer\ncannot get along without you.

Once in Boston, when the sidewalks were jammed with people coming\nhome from work, I said to myself: ''Thousands are walking ahead of me, but\nI am determined to be the first to get to my destination. I must be at the head\nof this crowd. If there is a little opening anywhere, I shall go through it.\"\n\nAnd so, wherever there was a space I slipped through until I got to the\nhead of the procession of people.

Un-\nless vibration has rhythmic intelligence to guide it, it becomes disturbing. In-\ntelligence itself is vibration, and consists of various forms of thought.\nThoughts are separated from each other by their different rates of vibration;\nwithout this relativity of vibration it would not be possible to cognize any vibra-\ntion in the universe.\n\nEverything in creation has its own particular rate of vibration. If two\nwaves move Side by side, there is harmony, but if one wave strikes another,\nthere is a conflict of forces. In your life you should avoid contradictory vibra-\ntions in order to live harmoniously. The vibrations of one's physical surround-\nings should harmonize with the vibrations of the physical being. The harmoni-\nous man should have harmonious vibrations of color, form, and so forth,\naround him.\n\nDifferent rates of vibration, balanced in the cosmic rhythm, produce be-\nfore us the majestic cosmos. As the sun holds the planets and stars around it\nby its great magnetic force, so our ego binds our thoughts and cells together.\nIf this ego has left the body (as in death), or is inactive during prolonged un-\nconsciousness, all the thoughts will vanish from the body, the strings of life\nforces will be burst asunder, and the cells will begin to decay.\n\nVIBRATION IN RELATION TO PEOPLE In relation to people, how do you\n\nknow when you get good vibrations\nor bad vibrations from them? First of all, there is a ''feeling.'' Some people\ndo not realize the difference between real vibrational differences and mental\njudgment. You must keep a very kind feeling within your heart at all times--\na feeling that is absolutely unprejudiced. That feeling can judge better than\nall the intelligence in the world.\n\nThe best way to know what kind of vibrations people radiate is to watch the\nmicrophone of your feelings, right in your heart. It is the most sensitive in-\nstrument of all. For accurate results, however, you must be free from any\nattraction to the opposite sex, and from any feelings toward others of attrac-\n\ntion or repulsion. A neutral state of consciousness is necessary. When you\ncan use that microphone of pure feeling, which does not judge from prejudice\nand emotion, then you have developed spiritual sensitivity.

You naturally love those who are dear to you,\nand you must learn to give that kind of love to the whole world. In the soil of\nyour heart the seeds of love are growing; cultivate those seeds with the water\nof universal love and universal sympathy. As soon as you love all people with\nthe intensity of the love that you have for your family, then you are expressing\ndivine love. The whole purpose of loving is to develop that kind of love. Uni-\nversal love is trying to vibrate through you, but attachment, limitations, and\nconcentration on the senses hinder the free expression of that universal love.\n\nYou can also sense the general vibratory rate of the body, mind, and soul\nof another person. An ill person has negative, inharmonious body vibrations,\nand he should reject them. If you live with sick people all the time, they tend\nto make you sickness-conscious. You must be stronger than the thoughts and\nsuggestions constantly vibrating from other people. That is the way to conquer\nwrong vibrations that come into your environment.\n\nSome people vibrate nervousness; some, temper; and some, cruelty.\nOther people have no will; the minute you meet them you feel their spineless-\nness. Some people vibrate kindness and you love them immediately. You must\nalways keep in tune with positive high vibrations in your heart..\n\nEven in foods God creates harmony of color, and when you cook foods too\n‘much, you destroy these colors. In this way you contradict the harmonious\nvibrations of foods, so that they become inharmonious. In eating, in arrang-\ning furniture, and so on, you must have harmony. Cheerful colors always\ncreate happiness in the mind. Some colors are soothing, while others are\nirritating.\n\nVIBRATIONS OF THOUGHT AND REASON Vibrations of thought are so\n\npowerful that if you live in the\nsame building with persons who have wrong thoughts, their wrong vibrations\nwill affect you unless you are powerful enough to protect yourself. If you have\na very powerful good vibration of your own, you do not need to be concerned\nabout people who have wrong vibrations.\n\nThen there are vibrations of reason. There should be a balance of feeling\nand reason if you want to be happy. That can come only by surrounding your-\nself with vibrations of kindness and intelligence. Not only do you get vibra-\ntions from outside, but you must create the right kind within yourself. What\nyou need is a complete balance between the vibrations of reason and feeling.\nYou must be ready to feel everything that is around you, and yet you must be\nable to’ estimate everything according to its real value at the same time. That\nis why the combination of man and woman on a spiritual plane is very good,\nfor then they combine pure feeling and pure reason. As one meditates deeply\nand unites soul with Spirit, this balance of pure reason and pure feeling is ex-\npressed in the highest degree.\n\nSOUL VIBRATION A strong soul vibration is evident when a person is\n\n"}

That is the vibration to carry with you wherever you\n\ngo, so that whoever comes in contact with you may forget all but the power and\n\nlove of God. Try to be the clear crystal through which the sunlight of God's\n\npresence may reflect to all mankind. This kind of vibration gives joy to you\n\nand at the same time it burns away all evil. The vibration of God is the most\nintelligent of all and produces perfect harmony. When you let that vibration\n\npass through you, all other vibrations become harmonious within you. That is\n\nwhy Jesus said: ''Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all else shall be added\n\nunto you. \"\n\nThe God that I perceive is as real--more real--than all this human pano-\nrama. By constantly desiring that my eyes should be opened, I received Him.\nI had closed my eyes to Him, but through unswerving determination and con-\nstantly trying to surround myself with harmonious vibrations within and without,\nthrough regular meditation, my eyes were opened and I saw Him templed every-\nwhere.\n\nSo remember this: develop a fine sensitivity. After you meditate deeply,\nthen use that perception and the sum total of the feeling that you have after med-\nitation, and concentrate that feeling in the heart. Then it will give you power\nto radiate good vibrations and to absorb good vibrations, and it will also give\nyou wisdom.\n\nSome bacteria experience in two hours what it takes us years to feel. They\nare born, give birth, and die within two hours. Scientists also are studying\nlife in the electron and the atom. This short span of life that we have is but a\nwink of eternity and from the standpoint of time we are just like the bacteria.\nWith every wink of God, a life span of one hundred years passes away. So, do\nnot waste your time. Do not be controlled by your desires. Do not allow your-\nself to do anything that you should not do. Be the master of yourself. If you\nknow that you are master within yourself, nothing else matters. Every minute\nis a link between you and God. So you should not waste your time here on earth,\nbat learn now to be master of yourself.\n\nDispel all inharmonious vibrations from your life by meditating regularly.\nIn deep communion, God comes as ever new Bliss. The God of the clouds, the\nGod of the moon and the sun, the God who is templed in all creation is within\nyou and manifests as peace. Learnto love Him asthe peace and bliss of medi-\ntation.

Did\nlove lie like a hidden seed in the soil of hearts, ready to grow into blossoms\nof family, social, patriotic, and human love, or is love the product of the\nfactory of our interacting soul-revolving feelings?\n\nIn the heart of Spirit lay divine love--latent, undefined, unexpressed, un-\nused.

God bound the stellar systems, solar systems, and island universes with\nthe greater love of His harmony, lest they collide and destroy one another, and\nstart disastrous fires burning the peaceful blue forest of space, and menacing\nthe living inhabitants of all ether.\n\nThe earth, by the gentle attracting motherly love force of gravity, holds\nher children--smiling blossoms, grave mountains, boisterous bounding oceans,\nbuxom winds, restless plumed birds, and humans--from falling off her soft\ncloddy breast. The music of gravity is borrowed divine love of the earth, which\nholds together the scenic beauties dancing inrhythm with the earth around the\nsolar God.\n\nAll these beautiful planet children went out of God to play the cosmic play\nin the tract of space harmony. But when these children planets remain truant\ntoo long, playing in space, forgetful of the bosom home of God, He calls back\nthe outgoing sparks; and the planets race headlong to come home and sleep in\nHis bosom of calm dissolution. @\n\nThe sea loved to send the servant storm to play with its ''children\" waves.\nBut when the big waves begin to fight too much with the little waves, the storm\nis called off and billows are made to vanish in the chamber of calm--hidden in\nthe sea breast. Similarly, life-tossed waves of living forces, heaving and play-\ning over the ocean spaces, are called back to the home of eternal rest. Divine\nlove is the force expressed in the balance, created by the magnetic force which\nkeeps stellar systems and floating universes swimming in eternal rhythm.\n\nThe invisible eyes of Omniscience opened up into countless fiery-eyed plan-\netary globes of love and peered through dark spaces, inviting brother stars to\njoin the festivity of the first emerging finite expressions of cosmic love. Love\nof God flowed through their planetary eyes. The planets, by their hypnotic eyes\nof fiery love, held one another in the balance of infinite attraction. So the living\nspace fires formed little groups and started the cosmic dance of outwardly man-\nifest divine love.

Baptism by immersion in water symbol-\nizes the cleansing or purifying of the body in order to practice\nthe disciplines of a spiritual life. Purification of the body aids in, and should\nprecede, purification of the mind. All souls who desire to begin living the spiri-\ntual life first have to purify their bodies: ''Cleanliness is next to godliness. ''\nHowever, baptism of the body, unless followed by baptism of the mind, becomes\npractically meaningless. Unless we cleanse the mud of wickedness from the soul\nby calmness, meditation, and constant spiritual vigilance, we will retain bad\nhabits in spite of the temporarily purifying effect of water on our bodies and\nminds.\n\nTo illustrate this metaphorically: A Hindu saint said to his would-be disciple:\n\"Son, it is not necessary to bathe in the Ganges to purify the mind from sin. Your\nsins will leave you temporarily while you bathe in the holy waters; but they will\nwait for you in the trees on the bank, and as soon as you come away from the\nsacred influence of the holy water, they will jump on you again. 11\n\nIf you bathe every day and meditate immediately thereafter, then you will\nfeel the power of baptism by water. Water opens the pores of the skin, letting\nout disturbing body poisons, calming and soothing the whole organism. Water\ncools the nerve endings and sends reports of cool sensations through the vital\ncenters, balancing evenly all the vital energies. All life came primarily from\nenergy, then from nebulae, then from water. All seeds of life are irrevocably\nconnected with water. Physical life cannot exist without it.\n\nBAPTISM BY Man is a combination of body, life force, and conscious-\nTHE HOLY GHOST ness--a reflection of Christ Consciousness. His life force\n\nis a reflection of cosmic energy. His body is condensed\ncosmic energy and life energy. Consciousness, life force, and the body are\ndifferent rates of conscious Cosmic Vibration. Life force at a higher rate or\nvibration becomes Cosmic Consciousness, and life force when it vibrates gross-\nly, changes into electrons, atoms, molecules, and bodily flesh. The human body,\nlife force, and consciousness, being three different vibrations, are held together\nby the nucleus of the ego and the soul. Manis condensed vibration. In order for\nthe soul to be freed from the cage of the threefold vibrations of body, life force,\nand consciousness, it has to be baptized or united with the original cosmic vibra-\ntion of Om. When the wave feels itself isolated from the sea, its boundaries\nmust be expanded until they encompass the sea.\n\n"}

By deep meditation, the\nbody loosens its atomic vibrations and becomes life force, and by deeper medi-\ntation the astral body changes through elaboration into the ideational body. Then,\nby wisdom, the ideational consciousness becomes expanded into Christ Conscious-\nness.\n\nIt must be remembered that when the yogi (one who practices yoga, or\nstrives to unite his soul with the Absolute) listens to the Cosmic Vibration, his\nmind is diverted from physical sounds of matter outside his body to circulatory\nsounds of the vibrating flesh. Then his consciousness is diverted to the subtler\nvibrations of the astral body. By deeper meditation, his consciousness wanders\nfrom the vibrations of the astral body to the vibrations of consciousness in all\natoms. Then the consciousness of the yogi hears the Holy Ghost or Cosmic\nSound emanating from all atoms. This is the way that ordinary consciousness\ncan be baptized or expanded into Christ Consciousness through the expanding\npower of the Holy Ghost, or the all-spreading vibratory sound of Om heard in\nmeditation by the practice of the Om Meditation Technique given in Lessons 27\nto 30.\n\nWhen Om is chanted, it travels not only all around the earth, but throughout\nall vibratory space and eternity. The sound emanating from the vibration of all\nr atoms-is called the Holy Ghost, or the Sacred Vibration. When, by the practice\nof deep meditation, one is able to shut out all sounds of matter, one's conscious-.\nness passes through the musical astral sounds to the sound of Om, or the Holy\nGhost. When the yogi's consciousness is able not only to hear this Cosmic Sound,\nbut also to actually feel its presence in all finite vibrating matter, then the soul\nconsciousness of the yogi becomes one with the Holy Ghost, or Holy Vibration.\n\nWhen Jesus met John the Baptist, his guru preceptor of former lives, Jesus\nwas baptized by this omnipresent sound of Om, and he also saw the spiritual eye,\ndescribed as the dove descending from heaven. The wings of the ''dove'' are the\nring of golden light (epitomizing the vibrating energy of the Holy Ghost) and the\nring of blue light (representing the Christ Intelligence); the mouth of the dove is\nthe silvery star in the center (symbolizing Spirit).\n\nBAPTISM BY The voice of God, the omnipresent vibration of Om, signified:\nCHRIST CON- \"Thou art My Son.\" Jesus felt his consciousness attuned to\nSCIOUSNESS the Christ Consciousness, the Son or only begotten reflection\nof God the Father's intelligence as manifested in the Holy Vibra-\ntion. In other words, Jesus first felt his body as the entire vibratory creation in\nwhich his little body was included; then, feeling his cosmic finite body, he felt\nthat within the cosmic body of all creation there was a Christ or Universal Intel-\nligence.

''God so loved the world\n(the creation He had made), that He gave His only begotten Son'' to redeem it;\nthat is, God the Father incarnated as the hidden Christ Intelligence in all matter\nand in all living beings in order to bring each one, by beautiful evolutional coax-\ning, back to His home of All-Blessedness. When all mortal tests are overcome,\none ceases to reincarnate in matter; that is, he need \"go no more out. '!\n\nSaint John said about Jesus: छिप as many as received him, to them gave\nhe power to become the sons of God'' (John 1:12). The plural number in 1180118\nof God\" shows distinctly that all persons could become sons of God who clarify\ntheir consciousness by meditation and receive--or in an unobstructed way reflect\n--the power of God. In other words, they could be one with Christ Consciousness,\n_ the only begotten reflection of the Father in all matter, and become sons of God\nlike Jesus.\n\nThe Spirit would not be so partial as to create one Jesus and make all other | ।\nmen only mortal beings. God could create thousands of ready-made divine\nJesuses and export them to earth; and, being predestined spiritual puppets of\nGod, all of them would naturally behave on earth as Christs. But such Christs\ncould not be ideals to struggling mortals with all their frailties. When, however,\nwe see a man who has become a Christ by self-struggle and the proper use of his\nGod-given free choice and power of meditation, then hope of salvation stirs in\nthe weak, matter-tortured, fear-maligned, timorous, frail human breast.\n\nBAPTISM OF The student of Self-Realization Fellowship will find that\nHUMAN after listening to and feeling the Cosmic Sound throughout\nCONSCIOUSNESS the physical, astral, and ideational cosmoses, or in the\nphysical, astral, and ideational Holy Ghost, his conscious-\nness will vibrate with Omnipresence in all creation. When his expanded con-\nsciousness becomes stable in all creation, it feels the presence of Christ Con-\nsciousness in all vibration. Then the student becomes Christlike; his conscious-\nness experiences the ''second coming\" of Christ; he feels in his body vehicle the\npresence of Christ Consciousness, as Jesus felt Christ expressed in his body.\nMost human beings find their consciousness bound to the body; but by listening\nto and feeling the Om vibration and intuitive Christ Consciousness, the yogi\nrealizes that God the Father, or Cosmic Consciousness, exists inactively in\nregions where there is no motion or presence of the Holy Ghost vibration. The\nHoly Ghost vibration is limited to a certain tract of space, which is peopled by\nthe cosmos and all its island universes. All planetary creation is condensed @\nHoly Vibration.\n\n"}

Then the student, like Jesus, can say: ''I (Christ Conscious-\nness in creation) and my Father (Cosmic Consciousness beyond creation) are\none. ''\n\nWhen vibratory creation exists, God assumes the triune aspect of Father,\nSon, and Holy Ghost. When, by cosmic dissolution (greater than Noah's flood,\nwhich was only partial dissolution) the Holy Vibration is dissolved, God the\nFather, Son, and Holy Ghost become reconverted into the one unmanifested\nAbsolute Spirit.\n\n2k KK\nTHOUGHTS TO REMEMBER\n\nOm is the faithful witness of the beginning of all creation. The Hindus call\nit Om, the Christians call it Amen, and the Mohammedans call it Amin. When\na motor is running, you know that it is doing so by the sound. The same is true\nof creation. It is rotating at a tremendous rate of speed, and sound comes from\nthis. Wherever there is activity, there is sound, but the highest and the lowest\nsounds are not audible to the human ear.\n\n-Spirit's first vibration is the Om sound, and if you tune in with this sound,\nyou will be in constant contact with all creation, and God. This sound can be\nheard in meditation, and if you are constantly listening to this sound, you will\nfeel the presence of the Christ Consciousness. When we chant Om, we must\nremember to try to listen to that sound.\n\n3K और\nTHE DREAM STORY OF DIVINE LOVE--Part 2\n\nThrough the central heart or nucleus in the solar system and stellar system,\nGod is trying to pull everything back into Himself. But His divine pull of love\nonly acts through evolutional persuasion. God could have pulled all truant things\nback into Himself in a trice; but He did not do it because He gave all His children,\nwho came from Him, the joy and privilege of independence even as He enjoys it.\n\nSo all things resist the cosmic pull of divine love and keep their individual\nexistence. Cosmic Love can melt everything into its perfection only if all beings\nand objects are willing to yield to God's evolutional persuasions. Disobedient\nplanets are constantly being recalled from their truant wanderings to rest in\nGod's bosom of dissolution.\n\nGod's cosmic love is working slowly but surely, trying to swallow every-\nthing within itself. Divine Love became a stem to hold fragrant petals together,\n\n"}

Because truth is one; and if we can find the points of similarity in\ntrue teachings, we will see that truth is in each of them, and that they are one\ninthe truth. The differences among religionists are based on superficialities.\n\nThere is hardly a religious belief in the world that has not already been\ntried out in India; and there is hardly a religious belief in the world that has\nnot drawn its inspiration, directly or indirectly, from India. The religion of\nIndia has several aspects: the ethical, the metaphysical, and the intuitional. .\nThe last is that aspect of India's sacred teachings by which religion can be\nmade practical. That is, belief can be converted into actual experience of\nGod, by attunement of our human consciousness to the intuitional divine con-\nsciousness of the soul.\n\nIn India a scientific procedure is followed to find a true teaching. Seekers\nare advised to search for truth until they find a real teaching, and then to hold\nfast to it without digressing. The great teachers point out that no one can\nreach his goal if he diverts the efforts he is making in one direction in order\nto follow every other teaching that comes to his attention. The test of a teach-\ning is: ''What is this teaching doing for my physical, mental, and spiritual\nwelfare?'' Those students who have followed Self-Realization teachings with\nfaith, devotion, and steadfast effort, know that these teachings can pass the\ntest.\n\nBecause they have not understood the superficial aspects of Hinduism,\nsome uninformed people have erroneously called Hindus \"heathens\"; not real-\nizing, perhaps, that to Hindus the attitudes and actions of many Westerners\nappear heathenish. Such derogatory generalizations are born of ignorance of\nthe truth. If we know the truth, we know it is the same anywhere.

Christ\nConsciousness, being universal. could not have been thus limited; but it could\n\nvibrate or manifest in the body of Jesus.\n\nJadava Krishna (or Kristna) is the Christ of the Hindus. Both these great\nworld prophets could rightfully claim the same title: Jesus in whom Christ\nwas manifest, and Jadava, in whom Kristna was manifest.\n\nThe Hindus scientifically explored religion, and found that there is a uni-\nversal consciousness that is present in every cell of every being and object in\ncreation; and that it is a reflection of the omnipresent consciousness of the\nAbsolute Spirit beyond creation. They called this consciousness that pervades\ncreation Kutastha Chaitanya: Christ Consciousness. One meaning of the word\nKutastha is ''anvil''--that on which many different things can be made, but\nwhich itself remains unchanged. God's consciousness is active in creation as\nChrist Consciousness; yet Christ Consciousness remains essentially unchanged\nor undisturbed, one with God the Father.\n\nA person who has attuned his consciousness, as Jesus did, with the Christ\nConsciousness everywhere can feel Christ Consciousness even in his finger\ntips, in his heart and head--wherever there is vibration. Jesus could feel his\nconsciousness everywhere in the world and everywhere in space, because\nChrist Consciousness is a universal consciousness. Being one with it, he saw\nall beings, all objects, as reflections of God; and he could love all creatures\nas expressions of God. When you can feel that impersonal, all-inclusive love\nfor every creature, you are in tune with Christ Consciousness.\n\nLord Krishna of India lived much earlier than Christ, and the word Christ,\nor Krishna, as we know it in India, originated with him, because he expressed\nthat universal consciousness. Just as Jesus did later, Krishna performed\nmany miracles; and there are even many similarities in his life story. Mira-\ncles come as a natural law to those who know God, as Jesus and Krishna did.\nBut those who become attached to miracles will lose God. The Lord must be\nthe sole goal of our hearts.\n\nIf you put some salt water in a bottle and cork it; and then place the bottle\nin the ocean, the water in the bottle cannot mix with the water of the ocean.\nRemove the cork and the salt water in the bottle mingles with the salt water in\nthe ocean; they become one, being composed of the same ingredients. Similar-\nly, if we remove the cork of ignorance from the bottle of our consciousness,\nwe become one with the great universal consciousness. God's consciousness\nis everywhere; it is present throughout His whole creation as Christ Conscious-\nness. Just as you know when anything is happening in your body, He knows\neverything that is going on anywhere in the universe. Both Krishna and the\nChrist spoke of the universal Christ Consciousness. They had pulled out the\ncork of ignorance that separated their human consciousness from the ocean of\nChrist Consciousness, and had become one with it.\n\n"}

How can we dothis? One way is by endeavoring to love\neverything that is. We tend to love only our family, friends, those people and\ncreatures with which we are familiar. But to extend and expand our love to\ntake in others outside our little circle is to evolve toward Christ Consciousness.\n\nThe transcendental way to attain oneness with Christ Consciousness is by\nmeditation. Thatis, by uniting ourselves first with that all-pervading con-\nsciousness of God in creation, we automatically feel and realize our oneness\nwith all the rest of His creatures; and we easily love them, recognizing them\nas all being individual expressions of Himself. We know that we, and they too,\nare all part of His one Being.\n\nThe body and its limited sensibilities constantly tries to convince your\nconsciousness that you are not divine, but merely a fleshly mortal being. But\nevery night God shows you in sleep that the real you is not the body; your con-\nSciousness is ever aware; it tells you in the morning how you slept. There-\nfore you exist as a consciousness that is beyond and apart from the body. Self-\nRealization studies have taught you how to become consciously aware of this\nsoul consciousness, how to realize you are not the wave of the body but the\nocean of God's consciousness behind the body. Both Krishna and Jesus taught\nthis truth.\n\nTHE HOLY TRINITY is the same in Hinduism and in Christianity. The\n\nTrinity is not a contradiction of one God, but symbol-\nizes a metaphysical truth: that One became Three. In the beginning there was\nonly Spirit, the One. But as soon as Spirit projected out of Itself that ball of\nvibrating light and creative energy which became the universe, Spirit took on\nthe aspect of the Trinity.\n\nThe sphere of vibration is called the Holy Ghost--''Ghost'' means vibration,\ncreative energy. ''Ghost'' also means something invisible and intelligent. The\nCosmic Vibration is both invisible and intelligent. \"Holy\" signifies its spiri-\ntual origin and nature; that this vibration is guided by the intelligence of God.\nHis intelligence is present in creation or Holy Gnost as the ''Son.'' The ''Son\"\nor Christ Consciousness is the only undistorted manifestation or reflection\nof God's consciousness in creation.\n\nImagine that nothing exists except light. Then imagine a blue crystal\nball appearing inthe light.

The great exponent of Yoga,\nPatanjali, explained that a sound is emanated by the cosmic intelligence work-\ning in the Holy Ghost ; every vibration emanates a sound. And so the Holy\nGhost or Cosmic Vibration emanates a sound--the Om of the Hindus or the\nAmen that St. John spoke of when he said: 'I was in the Spirit onthe Lord's\nday, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet\" (Revelation 1:10).\nThat trumpet is the Holy Ghost, sounding the call of the Heavenly Father to\ncome to our Cosmic Home.

Then try to mani-\nfest that realization in practice. Realization comes from constant regular\nmeditation, combined with wide-awake, ever busy, ever-searching mentality\nwhich strives to convert theory into solid knowledge through practice.\n\nAll beliefs should be thoroughly scrutinized. Overindulgence in study\nshould be avoided. Indiscriminate study, especially of religious books written\nby spiritual novices or untried enthusiasts, results mostly in indigestible\nhashes of imagination, emotion, and at best a diluted realization. Patanjali's\nYoga Aphorism, the Christian Bible, and Hindu Bible (Bhagavad-Gita), anda\nfew other books written by men of realization should be studied, a little ata\ntime, and meditated upon for hours or for days together. The best time to\n\n© read scriptures is after practicing meditation, when the intuitive feeling is\nawake.\n\n"}

But since that time I have met numerous people of different walks\nof life--and searched the vaults and secret tunnels of their lives--and I real-\nize how important it is to everyone to learn the art of right behavior.\n\nUneducated persons often do not behave well merely because they don't\nknow any better. It is safer then to remain quiet and merely decorate the\nscene, rather than to make a fool of oneself by speaking. But the intellectual-\nly smart often do not know how to behave either--they tend to exaggerate\nothers' peculiarities and often impute wrong meanings to others' motives and\nactions, owing to their hypersensitive imaginations. Intellectuals ought to feel\nand sympathize with other people asthey feel for themselves; then they can\nunderstand the difficult complexities of others' lives.

I humbly\nsuggest, ''Judge not any except yourself, '' or 'Judge not others unless you are\nrequested to do so.'' To criticize others is bad enough, and to expose others'\nfaults publicly is a sin against God who dwells in the temple of the error-\nstricken as well as the righteous.

Under no\ncircumstances work or act from a center of restlessness, with your concen-\ntration centralized on your restless state of mind. All actions should be per-\nformed with peace, calmness, self-possession, intelligence and keen concen-\ntration.\n\n2K\nTHE STORY\n\nIt does not seem possible that we who, according to the scriptures, are\nmade in the image of immortal God, can cease to exist at death. Neither can\nwe imagine, as some would have us believe, that imperfect human beings can\nat death merge at once into the perfect being of God. It stands to reason that\nif we are cut off by death in an imperfect state, we shall have to be reborn on\nearth in a similar form in order to have another opportunity to perfect our-\nselves. We must wipe away all the stains of our errors before we can merge\nin God.\n\nMen seldom reincarnate as animals. That would be devolution instead of\nevolution. In rare instances, however, it happens that a person who has lived\na very animalistic existence is drawn into the body of an animal, to learn\nsome lesson. This explains the ''thinking dogs\" and ''thinking horses'' which\nhave puzzled scientists who have tested them.\n\nBut the case of a man taking on an animal body, as described in the follow- @\ning story, illustrates an entirely different principle. It is said that a great\nsaint or teacher who is highly evolved can deliberately assume the form of an\nanimal in one or more incarnations. To prove that God is omnipresent, some\nsaints have worked not only through human vehicles but also through the vehi-\ncles of lower animals, even as electricity can work in the human body as well\nas ina mechanical machine. God operates the life force of humans, animals,\nand atoms; saints who become One with Him show that they also can operate\nthrough human bodies, animal bodies, and atoms. This was demonstrated by\nJesus when he put his omnipresent life into the dead body of Lazarus. He also\ndemonstrated, by making the fig tree barren, that he could shut off the life\nforce. He thus proved that he had the power to put on or shut off life at will.\nJesus, having atomic control, also fed many people with a few loaves of bread.\nSaint Francis also had power over animals: birds obeyed his request to be\nquiet and listen to his sermons, then flew away in the form of a cross; anda\nvicious wolf became friendly and ceased its vicious...carnivorous habits.\nSaint Francis, by his omnipresent consciousness, awakened the sleeping God\nin the wolf and changed its nature.\n\nTherefore, just as a saint can influence animal bodies, so he can encase\nhimself, or reincarnate, in any sort of body. The scriptures and literature\nof India contain many stories of such incarnations. So ] hope you will under-\nstand the theme of this story about the reincarnation of one of India's holy\nsaints in the body of a mother squirrel.\n\n"}

Our story\ntells how this saint reincarnated as a mother squirrel, who, with her tiny\nbabies, lived in the top of a tree by the sea.\n\nIt is said that whoever fed this squirrel became prosperous, or was\nhealed of whatever affliction he possessed. Because of this, many people\ncame to know of the unusual mother squirrel and realized that the furry little\nbody housed a great soul who had reincarnated thus to demonstrate the will of\nGod even in the animal body.\n\nOnce, when the holy squirrel had gone far away from the shore in quest\nof food, a storm lashed the ocean into high waves and swept away the tree\nwith all the baby squirrels. The loving mother, on her return, discovered\nthe dark work of the sea and commanded: \"Ocean, give me back my babies\nor I will destroy you. \"'\n\nThe ocean paid no attention to her warnings. The mother squirrel was\nsubsequently seen, day and night for seven days, dipping her bush tail in the\nwater and then brushing it onthe sand. Noting this continuous, curious, de-\n__termined activity, an angel of God appeared and said: ''Holy mother squirrel,\n\nof all strange things, your action of dipping your tail in the ocean and rubbing\nit on the sand is the strangest. Please tell me the reason for your unusual\nbehavior, \"\n\nThe squirrel replied: \"Heavenly angel, the sea swallowed my babies in\nmy absence and paid no heed to my request to return them, so lam resolved\nto sweep the ocean dry. '' The angel laughed and remonstrated, ''Why mother\nsquirrel, in seven days more you won't have any brush left on your tail with\nwhich to attempt to run the ocean dry!\" But the tiny mother, with the deter-\nmination of eternity written on her face, replied: 114. thousand million lives\nor more will I be born again and again as a squirrel, and I will grow as many\nbushy tails as are required to dry the ocean. '' Saying this, the holy squirrel\nwent on with her strange activity.\n\nSeven days later, the brush of her tail had almost disappeared, and yet\nthe mother squirrel had not stopped her work. In fact, the dynamic will--in\ntune with the Divine Will--perfected in former incarnations had prepared her\nto continue for as long as the world endured. And so the angel of God came\nback, and with head bowed said: \"Holy squirrel, your will is law; please\nstop punishing the ocean and we will return your babies. ''\n\n"}

It is a manifesta-\n\ntion of soul consciousness. People hope blindly, or sub-\nconsciously, because the latent inner divine voice of the soul intuitively re-\nminds them: \"All is not lost forever. Death and failure are not final experi-\nences. Behind the dark clouds of temporary disillusionment awaits the silver\nlining of eternal fulfillment.'' We must keep hoping to know God, even to the\nlast breath, for we have all eternity in which to hope for the best and the high-\nest. The greatest insult to the soul is to attribute to it the consciousness of\nfinal despondency.\n\nHope is the eternal light on the dark pathway along which the soul must\ntravel through incarnations in order to reach God. Never extinguish hope, as\nyou would then have to wait miserably in darkness on the pathway until you\nchose to rekindle your searchlight of hope and started again on your journey\ntoward God.\n\nMost people hope and try for a while, but if they fail a dozen times they\ncease to hope and then become despondent. The student of Self-realization\nnever stops hoping, for he knows that he has all eternity in which to material-\nize his dreams. We must not think of death as an abyss of eternal oblivious\nsleep, but consider it a caravanserai where we rest for awhile so that we may,\nwith fresh hope and energy, journey on until we reach our mansion of eternal\nfulfillment in God.\n\nTo kill hope and be despondent is to put on an animal mask of limitation\nthat hides your divine identity. Instead, hope for the highest and the best; as\na child of God, nothing is too good for you. Keep on hoping! Move in that\nlight as you travel on pathways of incarnations to your luminous home in God.\n\nHope is born of the intuitive consciousness in the soul that sometime or othe: is born of the intuitive consciousness in the soul that sometime or other\nwe shall remember the forgotten image of God withinus.

Faith leads to the ultimate perception\nthrough which we know all things as they are. In ordinary mortals we see\nonly the manifestation of hope. When hope is used properly, to work for the\ndevelopment of the soul's hidden intuition, then faith, or intuitive Self-reali-\nzation, develops.\n\nFAITH VERSUS BELIEF The word faith is often erroneously used for\n\nbelief, as: Ihave faithinhim. A belief is\nproblematic and may be followed by disillusionment. Belief is the initial ex-\nperimental feeling about the truth of anything. Untested belief often crystal-\nlizes into dogmatic sentiment or, if discouraged, it may change into skepti-\ncism or unbelief. When belief turns into dogmatic sentiment or into skepti-\ncism it is destructive.\n\nConstructive belief is the attitude of mind necessary for testing the truth\nabout a thing in the beginning. The person who refuses to believe in anything\nrefuses to test and experiment, but these are the only means by which to\nknow truth. Constructive belief is good when one continuously believes and\nexperiments to prove a particular truth until its real nature is revealed. De-\nstructive -disbelief-is limiting, because one disbelieves for the sport of do-\ning so. Constructive disbelief or doubt is all right if one assumes an attitude\nthat says: ''Well, I shall not believe your statement until you prove that it is\ntrue. \"'\n\nAll phenomena or visible matter can be recorded by the senses, but not\ninvisible substances such as vibrations, subtle cosmic forces, and astral\nlights, which are unseen, unknown to, and unregistered by the limited power\nof the senses. According to Saint Paul (Hebrews 11:1), ''Faith is the sub-\nstance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.'' That is, the\nproof of the existence of all the subtle forces, and of God as the final Sub-\nstance, lies in faith. This instantaneous, all-knowing, all-seeing, intuitive\npower of faith is developed through deep meditation and conscious communion\nwith one's soul and, through that, communion with God.\n\n\"For verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye\nshall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall re-\nmove; and nothing shall be impossible unto 70०\" (Matthew 17:20).\n\nIf one has faith in, i.e., intuitive knowledge of, Cosmic Consciousness\nas the prime mover of all atomic creation, then, through that all-pervading\nconsciousness one can act on or control any portion of matter on the earth or\non a distant star.\n\n"}

When he does this, then the loving desire to offer help springs\n\nforth.\n\nSelfishness cramps and confines the omnipresent soul in a prison of limi-\ntation.

''\n\nThen the chagrined jumper puffed up to his full strength, and jumped\nfrom one side of the pond tothe other. ''Can your lake dare be twice as big\nas this?'' he asked, sure of triumph.\n\nThe lake frog could not restrain his sense of superiority as he confident-\nly replied, ‘Indeed, friend, my lake is bigger than a thousand ponds like\nyours.\"\n\nPiqued, the pond frog croaked his disbelief. 'Impostor!'' he cried.\n\"Vanity incarnate! What you say is impossible. Nothing could be bigger\nthan our pond. \"\n\nHowever, after considerable argument, the visiting frog persuaded the\npond leader and his brother frogs to visit the lake. Upon seeing the great\nbody of water, the skeptical leader of the pond frogs bowed at the feet of the\nlake frog and exclaimed: ''Mighty brother, indeed your watery mansion is\nmuch larger than we could ever have conceived. We never would have real-\nized this if we had remained in our narrow environment.

Consciously or unconsciously,\npeople feel your personality as animal or spiritual or businesslike or selfish,\netc. It is best to know what sort of person you are, so that you can change\nevil tendencies, for your own good and happiness; and so that you can refrain\nfrom imposing a negative or harmful personality upon others, thereby saving\nthem from suffering.\n\nREINCARNATION Personalities are formed through the sprouting of seeds\nAND HEREDITY of actions left from a previous incarnation.

Otherwise, the fact that some people are born\nhealthy and some born sick, or some born wealthy and some born poor, would\nseem to indicate some partiality on God's part. Health, wealth, sickness, or\npoverty that come in infancy are brought about by causes initiated in a past in-\ncarnation just before death. In other words, if you died healthy, or wealthy,\nor poor in your past incarnation, then in the beginning of this incarnation you\nwill display those prenatal acquisitions. Fortunately, all prenatal habits and\ninstinctive traits can be changed by cultivating wisdom.\n\nPersonalities that are negative as a result of the working of the law of re-\nincarnation and heredity can be changed by proper methods of concentration,\nspiritual discipline, and continuous mental and physical effort. According to\neugenics, a person's mind is fixed by heredity and cannot be changed, but the\nyogis teach that it is a man's own actions in previous incarnations, rather\nthan his family heredity in this one, that produce the individual traits in an\ninfant. Nor are prenatal habits imposed upon man by God; they are created\nby man himself through his own free choice; therefore all effects of heredity\ncan ——. gradually erased if a person uses his own free will to follow continuous-\nly the methods of self-discipline and Self-realization. Hence, all types of\npersonalities, no matter how deep-rooted, can be changed by using strong will\npower and continuous methods of self-discipline.

By studying the results of others' good\nand evil actions we may profit by their experience, developing wisdom without\nsuffering the harmful consequences of ignorant evil actions.\n\nGood personalities reflect the attractive qualities of God, the supreme\nGood. Personalities that manifest evil traits are reflecting the delusive cos-\nmic satanic force which is responsible for all the miseries of the world.\n\nTo develop a specific personality one must absorb the desirable character-\nistics of that personality by constant attentive association. Study, discussion,\nassociation, friendship, and respectful attention between two different person-\nalities causes a mutual exchange of their individual characteristics. In addi-\ntion, one should study the various characteristics of different types of person-\nalities and pick the kind of personality he likes. Then he should try to think\nand act and feel the qualities of the particular type of personality he wants to\ncultivate. If you want to be a poet, or a businessman, or an orator, or an\naviator, or a God-knowing saint, pick the best in that class and associate with\nthat personality, and intelligently follow his counsel and example until his\ntraits become your traits.\n\nBy studying the outstanding traits of various nationalities, one can learn to\nrecognize the utilitarian, active, swift, American-type personality and the\nspiritual, deep-thinking, slow, Hindu-type personality in one's own family,\nsociety, and country. Americans are marked by swiftness in active thinking,\nkindness, liberality, fickleness, and great utilitarianism in everything; the\nHindu Aryans by high spirituality, depth of thinking, slowness in business ven-\ntures, and kindness. The English are marked by tenacity, literary culture,\npride, formal mannerisms, patriotism, and aristocracy; the Scotch by congeni-\nality, frugality, and clannishness. The Germans reveal characteristics of\nscientific thoroughness, militaristic pride, and patriotism; the French show\nfriendliness, universality, formal congenial attitude, and love of art.\n\n"}

But since bodies are made after the pat-\ntern of animals, each individual physical and mental trait\nsuggests a specific animal. Man's anatomy, bone for bone, muscle for muscle,\ncan be compared to that of a horse, ape, or other animal.\n\nIf one studies the personality characteristics of the different animals, he\nwill find their various traits reproduced in different human beings. There are\nbrave persons who remind you of the lion. The king of beasts never kills un-\nless he is hungry. Lionhearted people would never knowingly destroy anyone's\nhappiness. Other people may remind you of the tiger, which kills through\nvicious instincts, even when its stomach is gorged. Some people are like the\ncobra, which bites at sight; such persons will cheat you or harm you at first\nmeeting, without any provocation. Some men and women are like cats. Just\nas a cat may eat a tame canary and then curl up peacefully, professing inno-\ncence, 80 some men and women do a great deal of wrong and yet hide under\na cloak of innocence. The cat is a very clean animal, but some are selfish;\nand some people are immaculately clean in regard to their physical bodies,\nbut within their minds are unclean with selfishness.\n\nMonkeys love to imitate whatever they see, and some persons are like\nthat. They imitate the mannerisms of real aristocrats without being able to be\nreal aristocrats. Monkeys are very restless too, always moving and frisking\n\n| । ~“about. There are people also who cannot rest even fora few minutes. They\nhave to keep going all the time. Monkeylike personalities imitate others' cus-\ntoms, fashions, idiosyncrasies, good or bad habits, and ideals, without dis-\ncrimination. Imitation without reason is productive of little good. (However,\neven blind imitation of good principles is good, and imitation of evil habits is\nof course harmful. )\n\nSome personalities are meek, like the dove and the lamb. They are hum-\nble and hurt no one. It is good to be humble, but weakness of character should\nnot be confused with meekness. In fact, it takes a very strong-willed person\nto be meek and to forgive insults through the superior but self-controlled\nstrength of his or her spirituality.\n\nThe donkey is famous for its stupidity and forgetfulness of the cause of its\nhurts. If it falls into a mudhole it is likely to repeat the error as soon as it\ngets out. The sex addict is an example of the human donkey personality. He\nmakes the same errors again and again. As the donkey does not remember the\ncause of injuries or punishments, so the human sex addict forgets the evil ef-\nfects of sex transgressions and does not desist from sex errors, no matter how\nthey weaken his health, heart, brain, vitality, and mental and moral strength.\n\nSome wealthy persons are like the cow; they give the milk of riches to\n| । their families, yet they themselves lead dull, uninteresting, unprogressive,\nmechanical lives.

It is very hard\nfor a devotee to give up known sense pleasures of the present for the unknown\npleasures that may arrive in the future. This is the reason why millions of\npeople today would rather eat, drink, and try to be merry now, than to take the\ntrouble to meditate in a quiet place and cultivate lasting, ever satisfying, inner\n\nhappiness. | ।\n\nEven the superman, although he is fixed in a high state of consciousness by\ndeep meditation, is still subject to the temptations of his prenatal and postnatal\nmemories of sense enjoyments, which promise quickly obtainable pleasures in\nplace of the hard-earned, lasting joy of self-control and meditation.\n\nIf you do anything wrongly for a long time, you form a bad habit that is\ndifficult to overcome. If you have lived to be sense-~-sufficient, it will be very\ndifficult for you to comprehend liberal, lofty, and spiritual thoughts. If you\nhave formed habits of restlessness, it will be painful to meditate until you be-\ncome intoxicated with the wine of joy.\n\naK oe\nCONQUERING DEATH THROUGH WILL POWER\n\nOne of my students told me an interesting story. He and his sister were\nboth students of these lessons. The sister became very ill and finally lapsed\ninto a state of coma. The brother was desperate; but he remembered what I\nhad taught about the power of will. He remembered, too, that I had explained\nthat a dying person's hearing is the last sense to go. He went to his sister\nand began to talk to her in order to rouse her will power. With deep concen-\ntration he spoke: \"Sister, come out of it. Remember what Yoganandaji told\nyou. Use your will!'' At that moment she took a deep breath, made a supreme\n\n"}

Afterward, when relating the experience, she said that ‘\nwhile she was dying, her senses were all leaving her; but although she could\nnot speak, she could hear what was being said to her.\n\n\"When I heard the doctor say that it was all finished with me, my breath\nwent,'' she told us. ''But as soon as I heard my brother telling me to make the\neffort and command the life force to return to my body, my will revived; my\nbreath came back and I sat प.\n\nThat was a remarkable case. So remember, if you are around a sick per-\nson, do not discourage him by negative thoughts or speech, as the doctor unwit-\ningly discouraged my student. Instead; send forth your will power continuously\nwhen you want to help anyone. You must continuously mentally pour forth life\nforce to that person through your will, until the healing becomes effective.\n\nWhat is it that heals? Life force. When you command your mind to move\nyour hand, the mind generates the necessary life current in your hand. When\nthe mind disbelieves its own power, as in sickness, the energy is shut off from\nthe body. The life force is always moving, its motion is what we call life.\nEven the slightest movement of your head is caused by the action of that life\nforce, whose power keeps the cells of the body together. When life force runs\nlow, all the cells of the body begin to die. Yet that tremendous power which is\nthe life of the body--the life of every living thing--is unrecognized.\n\nMillions of volts of life force travel in and around the body, but how can\nwe connect the current within the body with the cosmic currents outside the body\nto manifest healing? There are two ways: by imagination and by will. Imag-\nination is autosuggestion. You paralyze the life force by the consciousness of\nchronic disease. If this motion called \"life'' cannot heal the sickness in you,\nnothing can. Life energy is within you and around you, but how can you utilize\nit? In the first place, you must be convinced that the energy is there; and if\nit is there, you must be able to tap it. How? By consciousness and will power.\nThere is no other way. The energy in the flesh and in the universe can be united\nby will power. It is the will of God that is holding all the atoms in your body\ntogether and everything in the universe in order. You must attune your will\nwith God's will. Surely He who controls every corpuscle of your blood can\nheal you. You must first establish a consciousness of God.

Faith, or intuitive Self-realization, de-\nvelops when hope is used properly to work for the acquisition of the soul's lost\nintuition. Metaphysically, faith or intuitive experience of all truth is ever\npresent inthe soul. It gives birth to human hope and the desire to achieve, but\nit hides behind the wall of spiritual ignorance. Most human beings know prac-\ntically nothing of the intuitive faith latent in the soul, which is the secret spring\nof all our wildest hopes.\n\nTo kill hope and to be despondent is to put on an animal mask of limitation,\nand to hide your divine identity with the Almighty. Instead, hope for the high-\nest and the best, for as a child of God nothing is too good for you. Keep on\nhoping! Move in that light until you travel through pathways of incarnations to\nyour luminous home in God. Hope is born out of the intuitive consciousness in\nthe soul that some time or other we shall remember our forgotten image of\nGod within us.

May we dive into the deep-\nsea spaces of divine communion and become uncapturable.\n\nCOSMIC DELUSIONS\n\nMIND AND MATTER The sages of India teach that we should not be\nfanatics about anything, for example, denying the\nexistence of matter. We should develop our consciousness to that point\nwherein we can know that mind and matter both exist, but are not as we\nthink they are. Matter appears as a visible, tangible form, but in\nreality it is composed of unseen electromagnetic waves. It is a force.\nAll so-called solids that we see are insubstantial. They are composed\nof flying atoms held together by a magnetic force. Nothing is solid.\n\nThis world was created through the vibration of God. Matter is one\nvibration and mind is another. Matter is a lower vibration, but to deny\nits existence is foolish. Humanity is suffering from delusions about\nmatter, earth, planets, body, mind, and soul. Only the wise and the\nspiritually awakened can discern the true nature of creation. For in-\nstance, it appears to our visual sense that the earth is flat and sta-\ntionary, but through scientific research it has been proved that the\nearth is round and rotating. According to Hindu philosophy an error\nentertained by one person is called avidya, or \"illusion,\" while an\nerror that deludes all mankind is called maya, or \"delusion.\"\n\nTEN PRINCIPAL DELUSIONS Our senses and reason can partially inter-\n\npret phenomena, or the appearance of sub-\nstances, but most of the time our senses are reporting falsely about the\nreal substance, or noumenon. Ten principal delusions of mankind are\nlisted here:\n\n1. The delusion of time and space, of seeing relativity in the\nAbsolute.\n\n2. The delusion of attachment to one family or to one country.\n\nThe delusion of consciousness whereby one feels pain in the\nbody instead of being aware of it only as a mental idea.\n\n"}

The delusion of the importance and worthwhileness of the body,\nwhich is really so insignificant and small.\n8. The delusion of finding it easier to cling to evil than to\ngood.\n9. The delusion of seeing matter only, without any awareness of\nthe presence of God in it.\n10. The delusion of not knowing that the seen is unreal and the\nunseen is the real substance.\n\nMETHODS OF The consciousness of pain is a delusion. Pain was\nDISCARDING originally a heightened sense of awareness. By\nDELUSIONS emphasizing our individualities, we have separated\n\nourselves from the rest of nature and have evolved\ndifferences. That is why so many things hurt the body.\n\nDualities originally existed in harmony and separateness. Their\ncollision was announced by the sense of awareness. But this awareness\nwas developed into pain. Under chloroform, a surgical operation on the\nbody is painless, for the mind is not aware of the condition of the _\nbody. Gandhi and others have demonstrated that a strong mind can con-\nsciously hold itself apart from the condition experienced by the body\nwhile under an operation; that is, avoid feeling pain that is created by\nhypersensitive awareness. Learn to be strongminded and ignore pain.\n\nThe country child feels much less pain from a thorn in the foot than a\ncity child would feel. Overcome sensitiveness by mental hardness.\nBanish pain from your consciousness and it will not be felt in your\nbody.\n\nThe delusion of the touch sensation is the most powerful. Close\nyour eyes, forget the feel of the body, and think of the vast limitless\nsphere of space around you as your vast body. Feel joy in every tissue\nof your space body; joy will be in your circulation; joy will flow\nthrough all the veins of your feelings. The consciousness of dragging\nflesh and bones about will disappear. You will touch only the peace\nfeeling of God. The phenomena of the senses will disappear. Their\nblindness will be revealed through the recovery of the one true sense of\nmeditation-born intuition. You will see, hear, smell, taste, and touch\nall diverse things as solely God. The Noumenon, the Absolute Substance,\nwill reign on the throne of your omnipresent consciousness.\n\nBanish the delusion of nationality, caste, creed, and color. You\nbelong to a living family of all God’s creatures. Close your eyes,\nmeditate upon the little circle of your family and country. Break the\nboundaries of this hereditary imagination and make a circle of boundless\nlove, a vast home of sympathy, a vast heart of feeling, and behold there\n\n"}

Yet none of\nCOSMIC DELUSIONS its various forms is what it appears to be.\n\nWe can behold, in a dream, a mountain or an ocean, or breathe the\natmosphere, or feel the heat of summer, or see sunlight or electricity\nlighting a city, or the vibrating colors of the aurora, or feel the life\nforce surging in millions of human bodies. God is dreaming the dream of\ncosmic motion pictures on the screen of delusive human consciousness.\nWhen one unites his own consciousness with God’s, he perceives this\ncosmos as God’s dream going through his mind. But no one can experience\nthis realization until he experiences his complete unity with God. Just\nas a dreaming person does not know that his dream of a city containing\nbuildings, streets, and lights is made up only of different vibrations\nof his imagination, frozen into thought forms, so one who is under the\nspell of the cosmic delusion does not see that it is only God’s dream.\n\nScience has proved that matter is actually electromagnetic waves,\nand that these waves are \"frozen\" light. Metaphysicians say that this\nlight is really God-vibration frozen into forms we see as matter. One\nshould certainly think over and meditate upon these truths until he can\nsee all matter as God’s dream.\n\nA cosmic delusion can also be overcome by meditating deeper and\ndeeper, until one can pass beyond the consciousness of the body. When\nyou meditate with closed eyes, all matter vanishes from the picture; and\nwhen you firmly feel that the real is One Consciousness of blessed omni-\npresence, then you will no longer perceive the delusion of the cosmic\nmotion picture. When in meditation the yogi feels the consciousness of\never new peace--that peace which can stand the challenge of all tests of\nphysical pain, passing pleasures, sorrows, and all mental dualities--—he\nachieves the complete dissolution of material perceptions. The fire of\nmeditation dissolves all dualities in the consciousness of an ever joy-\nous Spirit.\n\nLIMITATIONS Our senses are limited to certain vibratory scales.\nOF SENSES The eardrum picks up only a particular range of vi-\nbrations. The eye cannot see the most dim or most\npowerful lights. The sense of touch cannot feel the subtle forces. The\nsenses of taste and smell record only certain vibrations of olfactory\nand gustatory sensations. A man walks by the seashore, hearing only the\nnoise of a few waves, not of the whole ocean. He does not hear the\nMillions 07 80798 in the air except through the external medium of a\nradio. The radio has definitely proved that we are relatively deaf.\nThe cosmic noise of atoms, God’s program of limitless joyous experi-\nences, the voice of the ether, the sound of whirling planets, the rumble\nof the earth racing around the sun, the throbs of the heart and blood, ©\nare unheard by the physical ear.\n\n"}

Do not put it off, thinking that you will\nstart meditating tomorrow. Tomorrow will never come. Long ago I passed\na whole year in this attitude, and still I was saying, \"tomorrow.\" Then\nI made up my mind: \"I will start meditating today.\" Since then I have\nnever missed a day. ।\n\nYou must first resolve in your mind the importance of God. You must\nrealize inwardly that He is the greatest need of your life. First\npractice the presence of God in daily life by making your meditations\nvery deep. It is better to meditate a little bit with depth than to\nmeditate long with the mind running here and there. If you do not make\nan effort to control the mind it will go on doing as it pleases, no\nmatter how long you sit to meditate. -\n\nNext, practice long meditation with depth. That is what takes you\nto His kingdom. Until you learn to practice meditation both long and\ndeep, God will not reveal Himself to you. Gandhi devoted one day a week\nto silence and meditation. All saints who have found God sought that\nSilence. I give my nights and mornings to Him. It is not possible to\ndo exactly that in the business world, but if you will try, you will be\nsurprised how much time you will find to devote to thoughts of God. We\ndelude and deprive ourselves when we think we can wait until tomorrow to\nmake that great effort to be with God.\n\nGod responds when we make the effort. Then you know that He is. He\nwill no longer be a myth. He will respond invisibly to your desires,\nplaying hide-and-seek with you. And after that He will come to you\nopenly. Your past mistakes do not matter. But to continue in those\nmistakes is the greatest sin against yourself, for when you do wrong it\ndeprives you of true happiness. You have the power to hurt yourself or\nto benefit yourself. It is up to you to keep away the ants of ignorance\nthat bite your flesh. If you do not choose to be happy no one can make\nyou happy. Do not blame God for that! And if you choose to be happy,\nno one can make you unhappy. If He had not given us freedom to use our\nown will, we could blame Him when we are unhappy, but He did give us\nthat freedom. It is we who make of life what it is.\n\nYou may ask, \"Why, if we have free choice, do things not turn out as\nwe wish them to be?\" It is because you have weakened your will, your\nconsciousness of divine powers within you. But if you strengthen your\nwill by practicing self-control and meditation, it becomes free; and as\nsoon as your will is free, you are master of your fate. But if you find\nthat day by day you are living a life against your conscience, you will\nnever be free. You must take time to do the things that are good for\nyour own welfare. No one stops you but yourself. You make yourself a\nprisoner of your own moods and bad habits. That is why you must train\nyour will to be more elastic. Keep your will under control by doing the\nbest things in life--thinking more of God, meditating more, practicing\nself-control, -and so on.\n\nOf greatest help in your development is the habit of mental whisper-\ning to God. You will see a change in yourself that you will like very\nmuch. No matter what you do, God should be constantly in your mind.\n\n"}

Until you\nfulfill your strong desires, you mind will not rest; it ceaselessly\nworks toward fulfilling those desires. Your mind should be on God night\nand day in the same way.

Your mind should continually whisper, \"Night and day, night\nand day, I look for Thee night and day.\"\n\nThat is the philosophy of life by which we should live.

Actually, death is neither cessa-\ntion of motion nor annihilation of matter. The burned candle changes form, but\nits weight and constituent ingredients can be proved the same if the gaseous\ncombustion products that result from its burning are caught ina jar. Similar-\nly, the soul with its life and intelligence slips away at death from the burned-\nout body-candle. Matter is indestructible. Matter and life are inseparable.\nLife is intelligence; matter is sleeping intelligence. Since matter, an expres-\nsion of life, is indestructible, all life is indestructible.\n\nThe term \"span of life'' is relative. All waves of life emerge from and\nmerge into the Infinite Ocean. Some last longer than others, but they all have\nto express the Infinite variously and fully--the speck of stardust, the sun,\nmoon, clouds, rainbow, the gossamer, the nightingale, the whippoorwill. Natu-\nral death comes when each object, each human being, has done his full share\nin expressing the silent Infinite. The untimely death of a child or a youth sug-\ngests that he is discarding his diseased or disabled body vehicle and is exist-\ning elsewhere for better opportunities. If he has been snatched away by an ac-\ncident, it is probably so that he can be placed in a more suitable environment\nfor fulfilling his karma. That is why the beautiful rose and the glorious youth,\nafter expressing certain qualities of the Infinite, disappear as silent waves into\nthe fathomless Ocean of Life. The body is the froth of life on the waves of in-\ntelligence and soul. The froth is temporary compared to the individualized\nsoul wave; and the individuality of the soul wave is temporary compared to the\neternal Ocean of Life.\n\nLife is not bound by form or time, nor dependent upon material sustenance.\nThere are verified cases of men who have lived for long periods of time ina\nstate of suspended animation, proving that earthly life is not dependent upon\nfood or oxygen only. Life remains for some time even in acorpse, but ina\ndifferent form. A chicken heart can live many years in a solution of various\nchemicals--longer than the ordinary life span of a chicken. A crocodile lives\nsix hundred years; man lives sixty years; some insects live sixty hours; some\n\n"}

Yes, life is vagrant, appearing and disappearing\nlike a river in the desert of time.\n\nDeath causes fear in spiritually ignorant human beings, but to the wise it\nis a transition to a higher state--a promotion to higher grades of life. Those\nwho: learn in this life to live by Spirit, and are unattached to the body, quickly\ngain after death their soul-freedom from the bondage of oxygen, food, and\nwater. Mortals should learn to live more by inner energy, and strive to be\nunattached to the body.\n\nMATTER AND SPIRIT There is no difference between inorganic and organ-\n\nic life except that they are separate manifestations\nof the one Life. Nothing is really dead. The atoms in the flesh of evena\ncorpse are rapidly vibrating and constantly moving with life, as are those ina\nstone or a piece of metal. Different forms of life are manifestations of the\nsame life force. Just as ice, water, steam and their gaseous constituents of\nhydrogen and oxygen are different forms of the same thing, so also solids,\nliquids, gases, stones, crystals, plants, animals, and human beings, both\nliving and dead, are manifestations of life.\n\nThe Spirit contained in matter, and matter, are the same, just as hydro-\ngen and oxygen, if contained in a block of ice, are of the same essential com-\nposition as the receptacle itself. The thing contained is made of the same\n\n~wateriaras the container. If it were otherwise, matter and Spirit would be the |\n\nresult of two coexisting infinite forces, which is impossible. As the ocean\nbecomes waves, so does Spirit become matter. The waves are disturbed ocean,\nand matter is distorted, objectified Spirit. The waves, except in form, contain\nall the essential qualities of the ocean. Similarly, matter, organic and inor-\nganic, either manifestly or latently contains all the qualities of Spirit. Thus\nwe might say that life sleeps in the crude earth, dreams beauty in the flowers,\nwakes with power in the animals, and in man has consciousness of infinite\npossibilities.\n\nIt is by understanding that life continues after death that we can unite our\nconsciousness with the cosmic consciousness of God and find the cord of one\nlife, one law, one rhythm, and one wisdom uniting us all. It is only when we\nfeel that we are prodigal immortals on earth, and that our gift of discrimina-\ntion must be used to find a truly universal art of living, that we make the\neffort to unite all wisdom in our hearts and to realize that all of us are world\nbrothers marching hand in hand back to the mansion of God.\n\nTHE INFINITE If there were no death, countless millions of people would\nIS EVER NEW monopolize the cosmos. The planets and the universes\nwould trademark God with the seal of finitude. The infinite\nspaces would be exhausted. Without the contrast of death, life would lose its\ntaste of charming mystery; everything would grow old and stale. But this is\nnot the case. The Infinite is ever new, so by God's magic wand of renewing\n\n"}

The Infinite would lose Its nature by becoming finite, defi-\nnite, circumscribed, and molded.\n\nDeath gives soul actors above all else new robes in which to play new\ndramas on the stage of life.

But with his spiritual eye the wise man beholds,. in this\nlife and after death, a very attractive sphere. Instead of terrifying darkness\nhe finds glorious light. The soul bird-of-paradise finds its freedom from the\nlimiting cage of earthly manifestation. Appareled in multihued light, it soars\nin infinite directions, searching out and claiming its lost territory of eternity.\n\nIn the mellow light of the other world, the wise person perceives the inner\nnature of stars, stones, living beings, dust, iron, gold, earth, and planets\ndazzling with infinite brilliancy. Every object we perceive has two sides--the\ngross, ugly side, present before the physical eyes, and the inner, exceedingly\nbeautiful side, revealed to the eye of wisdom.\n\nNothing in that world fades quickly.

Think what a mystery death is! It swallows up the hard-\nworking man and the idle man alike, the good and the bad ones, and causes\ntheir bodies to revert to ether and the elements.

Wake up! Try to reap the harvest of imperish-\nable immortality and lasting, ever new Bliss on the temporary field of the\nbody. There is no lasting comfort to be had from the body. It slowly melts\naway. Nor can you press honey of divine happiness from the rock of sense\npleasures. But lasting comfort ceaselessly flows into the pail of your life\nwhen you squeeze the honeycomb of meditation and peace with the eager, pow-\nerful hands of will, and with ever deeper concentration.\n\nWhy do you intoxicate yourself with material desires? Your present mate-\nrial activity is a sort of sleepwalking. You are working in a dream of delusion\nduring the deathlike sleep of ignorance. How can you be so sure of yourself?\nHow can you devote your entire time to building up your material fortunes,\nwhich you must leave at the instant call of death? Material riches are too\nheavy to be carried in your astral car on your journey to the great beyond.\n\nWhy not prepare now for the last day on earth, when you will have to leave all\nthe things to which you are so attached?\n\nIdo not mean that you should be a cynic and not enjoy things in this life.\nBut do not be so attached to anything which you enjoy here that you will feel\nmental agony when you are forcibly separated from it. If you do not grieve for\nearthly things when your bodily garment is cast off, you will then have better\nthings hereafter.

But regardless of all these favorable outer impressions, 1 felt very\nsorry for him because he emanated deep gloom. I said to myself: ''What is\nthe matter with this man? He seems to have buried himself beneath this arti-\nficial habit of gloom. I must resurrect him.\"\n\nLooking straight at him, I said: \"Are you happy?'' He tried to discourage\nme with a fierce look, but I returned his gaze squarely. I reasoned that by\nhis glare he had already annihilated me in his mind, so he could not kill me\nagain. Finally he spoke. \"Is that your business?\" \"Yes,''I replied. \"I\nresurrect the walking dead.\"\n\nShortly, he said, 'Yes, lam happy.\" \"No,'' linsisted. \"I can tell what\nis in the mind. \"'\n\n\"Why shouldn't I be happy?\" he retorted. \"I put fifty to sixty thousand\ndollars a month in the bank.\" ''Poor soul!'' I thought, realizing that he believed\nthat his happiness lay in depositing those large sums inthe bank. But I said,\n\"Tomorrow you may not be here to carry a cent. Have you opened your 'bank\naccount! with God?'\"'\n\nLater he invited me to lunch, but he was still inwardly antagonistic to me.\nThen we talked again, and he became more reasonable. 'Do not rely on rich-\nes,'' ladvised. ''You may die and not even have a chance to make a will.\nThese material riches are not yours. Open your 'bank account! with God.\"'\n\nHe had become interested, so he suggested, ''Meet me in Boston.\" I\ncountered with the proposal, ''Meet me in Los Angeles. '' But he did not have\ntime. Later, when in Boston, I was in the hotel where he had told me he\nstopped. When I inquired about him the hotel manager said, ''Don't you know\nwhat happened to him?

To live again! To rise to renewed\nlife! What rises again...and how? We must understand in what way resurrec-\ntion means to live again. Everything is undergoing a process of change. These\nchanges are either detrimental or beneficial to the object which changes. For\nexample, if I take a dirty glass and strike it on the floor, it will be changed, will\nit not? But this change will not be beneficial; it will be harmful to the object.\nHowever, if I wash the glass and make it shine, that change is beneficial. Resur-\n\nrection means any beneficial change to an object or to a human being. means any beneficial change to an object or to a human being.\n\nThe soul outlives the body. It is eternal! But you do not have to wait until\n\"Gabriel blows his 11077111 in order to be resurrected. God would never force\nimmortal souls, created in His own image, to live for centuries in entombed\nbodies. The soul moves onto other regions when the body dies. If we are made\nin God's image, how can we die? Nothing really does die; it only changes form.\nSo even the death of the body is a delusion. But resurrection refers to the soul,\nrather than the body. For it is the soul, not the body, that is made in the image\nof God--immortal, incorruptible.\n\nIn the Christian world, the word \"resurrection\" has been greatly misunder-\nstood. People tend to cater to their own way of thinking, and very few try to\ndelve into the reality of spiritual mysteries. Most men and women are satis-\nfied with their own spiritual beliefs, and sometimes they are too listless to\ninvestigate or test those beliefs.\n\nYou can resurrect your old furniture in the carpenter's or upholsterer's\nshop. You can resurrect your house through the help of architects. But we are\ntalking of resurrecting the human body. In this context, resurrection means any\nuplifting change. You cannot remain stationary. You must either go forward\nor backward. Isn't it a great and inspiring truth, that in this life you cannot\nremain stationary? You must accept changes constantly: both those which are\nharmful to you and those which are beneficial to you. In this Lesson, we are\ntalking of the latter.\n\nResurrection is the art of emerging from what you are into what you are\ngoing to be in the future. In the beginning of creation you were a pure reflected\nimage of Spirit, but you have smeared that image with the soot of ignorance,\ncollected through many incarnations. That is why you were born with certain\n\n"}

Now you must clean your face of life with the purifying\nwaters of constant meditation. You must resurrect your real face of life from\nbeneath the superficially gathered soot of error. Then you will know that you\nwere, and are, and ever will be, a perfect reflection of Spirit. You are Spirit,\nthough now you imagine yourself to be mortal. But by meditation on your true\nSelf and by constantly performing your duties in a godly way, you will in time\nrecall your forgotten Spirit nature, and remain in that consciousness through all\nfuturity.\n\nEvery human being is an expression of the vast, immeasurable Spirit. Isn't\nit marvelous, when we see how human beings, without any motors, without any\nwires, without any visible source of power, run smoothly? The human machine\nwakes up in the morning, eats breakfast, goes to work, goes to lunch, goes back\nto the office, has dinner, goes to the movies (or perhaps enjoys some hobby at\nhome), then it goes to sleep, to wake up and do the same things all over again,\nday in and day out.\n\nWe have no existence except in the universal. The body you see is nothing\nbut materialized energy. How could energy be sick? Sickness is a delusion.\nBut simply saying that it is delusion is not enough. If in a dream you strike your\ndream head on a dream wall, you will have a dream fracture. Wake up and you\nare healed of your dream injury. Self-Realization Fellowship teaches that only\nby coming into attunement with God can one see that the universe is God and the\nhuman body a mass of condensed energy. And energy 18 ''frozen'' Cosmic Con-\nsciousness. We shaild not call it mind. Mind is different. To say that every-\nthing is mind is incorrect. It is Cosmic Consciousness that causes us to be\naware of different things, to have a consciousness of so-called matter and a con-\nsciousness of Spirit.\n\nDeath is not the end; it is emancipation, releasing us when we are too tired\nor exhausted by suffering to carry the burden of existence any longer. Death\nresurrects us from the painful tortures of flesh into awakened peace and calm-\nness. Death is a pension earned by years of struggling through life. It enables\nyou to rest. And when you are rested, your desires begin to work again and you\nwant to satisfy them. When those desires become strong again, you come back\ninto a human form.\n\nRESURRECTION Thought is infinite! Each word represents an ideal concep-\nFROM MENTAL tion of the Infinite, because behind each word and thought\nHABITS is a manifestation of the Infinite. Many waves of thought\n\nare dancing in the waves of consciousness, but behind that\nthere is the great unceasing ocean of Truth. Our thought expressions are waves\nof the ocean of understanding.\n\nIn the beginning of life, the soul plays with the body instrument; gradually it\nbecomes the slave of the body. Hence we must learn to live a life above the physi-\ncal plane. Mental development is superior to physical development. We find,\n\n"}

Intellectual attainments are undoubtedly helpful--all good\n\ngangs help. Gradually, we understand the way to resurrect the body into the\npirit.\n\nThe silk worm weaves threads around itself into a cocoon. Then, before it\nslips out of the cocoon and. becomes a butterfly, the manufacturer gets hold of it,\nand the silk worm meets its death in its self-created prison. We all do\nthat. Before the wings of spirituality grow, we foolishly weave threads of fear,\nworry, and ignorance around ourselves until disease and death come and destroy\nus. We find ourselves in bondage created by ourselves. What is most destruc-\ntive? Our own thought, our own wrong ways of living --acting first and then\nthinking. We must resurrect ourselves from spiritually deadening anger thoughts,\nfrom the thoughts engendered by selfishness, from the clamor of inharmonious\nliving.\n\nResurrect yourself from the littleness of life, the little things that disturb\nyou. Do you ever think that you have been completely unsettled by circumstances,\nruffled, shattered, whipped--lacking power? Banish such thoughts! You have\npower; you do not use it. You have all the power you need. There is nothing\ngreater than the power of the mind. Resurrect your mind from the little habits\nthat keep you worldly all the time. Smile that perpetual smile--that smile of\nGod. Smile that strong smile of balanced restfulness--that million -dollar smile\nthat no one can take from you.\n\nResurrect your immortality, your real Self, which has been too much identi-\nfied with human habits.

My power to overcome is greater than all the weight of my trials,\nbecause I am a child of God.'\"' Thus your mental powers will expand, and your\ncup of realization will be big enough to hold the ocean of knowledge. Then you\nwill have resurrected yourself.\n\nSometimes we pray theoretically; sometimes we think, momentarily, that\nwe are resurrected from our blemishes, but it is only imagination. The facts of\nour words and actions prove something different. Resurrect your Self. Resur-\nrection must take place not only theoretically; it must occur practically. The\npoint is this: It is necessary to resurrect yourself (your soul) in order to free\nit from the thralldom of the body--to unite it with Spirit in order to attain Self-\nrealization.\n\nRESURRECTION You must resurrect your mind from the consciousness of\nFROM DISEASE disease--from the thought of disease.

If you have not been able to\nresurrect yourself from the bondage of sickness, then you are still imprisoned\nbehind the bars of matter. To resurrect yourself from disease by right living is\nextremely necessary. After many years of deep study, you can learn how to\nexpress health--by contacting Cosmic Energy.\n\nSickness. and-health-are beth dreams; prosperity and failure are both delusive.\nBut a dream of prosperity is better than a dream of failure. Why not dream pros-\nperity if you have to have dreams? You should try to have good dreams in this\nlife. If you have too many bad dreams, you will be very busy crying and not\nhave time to know that it is alla dream.\n\nIK IK\nTHOUGHTS TO LIVE BY\n\nGive yourself to God. Do not break His laws; be reasonable. Do not be\nfanatical about anything. Do not wish to be free from every difficult situation\nbut be prepared to meet any kind of trial or test.\n\nControl the sensations of your body if you would like to know the difference\nbetween mind and matter. You can control the results of sensations by the power\nof your mind. Sensation is not a part of the mind unless the mind accepts those\nvibrations. Pain is the greatest delusion. The reason you feel pain is because\nyou are attached to the body. Sleep or no sleep, food or no food, comfort or no\ncomfort--it should not matter. Be above all these things.\n\nIam not telling you to be rash, but gradually to try to endure more as your\npower increases. For instance, try to eat food that you have said that you don't\nlike.

But\neven in India it is a rare occurrence if a prince leaves his materjal kingdom in\nsearch of the kingdom of God.\n\nBefore Jesus Christ graced this earth, there lived in India a great king,\nwhose spiritual queen had a vision clearly indicating that a great divine soul was\nsoon to become a member of her household. Strange to say, but true to the\nvision, the queen gave birth to a son, whom they named Siddhartha. Later, he\nwas called Gautama, the Buddha, or the ''Enlightened One. \"1\n\nPrince Siddhartha, from his early childhood, lived in a golden palace sur-\nrounded by gardens with every imaginable luxury and comfort. As the astrologers\nhad predicted in the horoscope of Prince Siddhartha that he was to leave the king-\ndom and lead the life of a renunciant, his father took extreme precautions to pro-\ntect his princely son from the sight of any misery or suffering, and from meeting\nany saints--which might arouse in him the consciouness of dispassion and desire-\nlessness for worldly objects.\n\nWhen the prince became a young man, he felt an inner urge to see the world,\nso one day he induced his principal attendant to escort him secretly out of the\npalace on a sight-seeing tour of the kingdom ruled by his father.. Once out of the\npalace, the prince felt a tremendous freedom and joy at the sight of thousands of\npeople saluting him and throwing garlands of flowers at him in token of their\nreverence for him as the future heir to the throne of India. Very soon, however,\nthe prince began to notice the difference between his marble palace and the\nrickety village homes filled with squalor and dirt. Having been surrounded from\nhis childhood with a spotless and rich environment, he had become accustomed to\nthinking that the whole world was like his surroundings. The result was that he\nbecame sick at heart upon realizing that he was so well provided for while others\nwallowed in worries and want.\n\nAs Siddhartha's chariot moved along through the cheering crowd, the prince\nsuddenly saw a deformed, crippled man. He at once thought of his own beaming\nface and healthy body, and, staring at the the sorry figure of the crippled man, he\nexclaimed to his attendant: ''Pray, good charioteer, tell me, can my body become\ncrippled or deformed or diseased?\" \"Oh, yes, Prince,'' answered the charioteer.\n\"The physical body is vulnerable to disease and suffering. One never knows what | ।\n\n"}

At this astounding revelation, the prince became still\nmore sorrowful and inwardly disturbed, and in his soul he felt the first dis-\nillusionment regarding the temporal material things that had encompassed his\nlife.\n\nAs the prince moved along in his golden chariot, he was astonished at seeing\na very old man with hoary hair and wrinkled face begging for alms. The prince\nstopped his chariot and accosted the old man: ''Dear friend, has your body\n\nalways been like this?'' \"Oh, no,'' the old man replied, \"my body was just as\nbeaming and healthy as yours in my younger days. Do not pity my old body, for\nyour body will also become like mine when you grow old.'' The prince gave some\n\nalms to the old man but inwardly shuddered at the thought of his own beautiful\nbody becoming shriveled and shrunk. He almost felt that the net of old age was\nalready being pulled in about him from all sides.\n\nThen to add further to his distress, as the chariot rolled along, the prince\nfinally encountered four men carrying a dead man on a bed, as is the custom in\nIndia. The prince commanded that the chariot stop before the lifeless form of\nthe man; then, in great bewilderment and agony, he asked his charioteer: ''Pray\ntell me, is this the end of all human life? Will my beautiful body be congealed\nby death?'' The charioteer hung his head and sadly whispered: \"Yes, my\nMaster, all life is subject to death and even you cannot become an exception in\nthat event. 11\n\n(To be continued)\nek\n\nAFFIRMATION\n\nI perceive myself as the Cosmic Center\naround which the sphere of Eternity, the\nsphere of Bliss, the sphere of omnipresent,\nomniscient, living space is revolving.\n\n"}

Resurrection also means relaxation, to let go\nof the tenacious habit of identification with your body. In meditation you release\nyourself from identification with your mental body; you must similarly relax the\nlife force from the internal physical organs, and thus do away with body con-\nsciousness. In that relaxation of your hold on body consciousness you become\nfree; your soul nature is revealed and you know that you can live without the body\nthough living in the body; it is separate.\n\nResurrection is not a change that takes place only after death. You must\nresurrect yourself while living in this body. You do it every night in sleep,\nwhich is unconscious resurrection. The next step is to do it in meditation, which\nis conscious resurrection. There were saints in India who, being apparently\ndead, were buried, and later brought back to life and consciousness after several\ndays under the ground. They have proved that resurrection is possible. Todo\nwithout food and still live is another kind of conscious resurrection.\n\nResurrection also means to free the soul from the cage of ignorance; to up-\nlift and release the soul from the bondage of mortal consciousness. Human life\nis sometimes very beautiful, but one who is attached to it is like a bird of para-\ndise in acage. You open the bird's cage, but because of attachment and habit,\nit may stay in the cage and not want to fly away. Isn't it a pity that the bird does\nnot want to go out into the boundless freedom whence it came? Yet it is afraid.\nWe also, feeling ourselves slipping out of body consciousness in deep meditation,\nmay think: 'Will I slide into the Infinite and never come back?'' We are afraid\nto try the skies of Omnipresence. We have lived too long identified with the body,\nand now we shrink from entering our own infinite home in space, frightened to\nresurrect our true omnipotence, our own divine omniscience of the soul.\n\nSPIRITUAL Life is glorious--beautiful--if only you can find God.

He says: ''Follow\nthe trail of beauty. Iam hidden somewhere in its heart. Iam Harmony, Iam\nLove, lam Beauty, Iam Fragrance, lam Joy.\"'\n\nWhenever you perform some good act, remember that you are being resur-\nrected. And another thing, you must resurrect yourself in meditation. Compare\nyour state before and after meditation. Meditate deeply if you would know Christ,\nor Krishna, or any of the great avatars. Let your evil habits, indifference, and\nrestlessness die daily. And every time you want to be attuned to Christ, think\nof him and look in the inner spiritual eye between the eyebrows. That is the\ncenter of Christ (or Christna)-consciousness. Your human consciousness has a\nlocation in the body, and this Christ-consciousness has a location, in the spiri-\ntual eye in the center of the forehead. When you are deep in thought, your eyes\nnaturally turn upward and your brow becomes wrinkled, to focus the eyes and\nattention on this center.\n\nDo not delude yourself by believing in your human limitations. Think of the\nexample of Jesus and other Christlike lives. Meditate! Man's cross is his\nheavy burden of bad habits. If you will try by deep meditation to get through the\nfog of restlessness, then you will see that you have come to the great soul king-\ndom of eternal happiness within. That is the resurrection I want you to experi-\nence. When your soul becomes attuned with the Spirit, then the silence begins\nto speak. You can go through that experience and feel that you are one with\nChrist.\n\nWhen the ordinary child cries and its mother brings a toy, the child is satis-\nfied and forgets what it was crying about. But the child who cries persistently,\nrefusing to be satisfied with toys, forces the mother to remain at his side. So\nif you want the gift of Christ Consciousness, you must be like the persistent\nchild: Throw away all your toys of useless desires and cry for God only. If\nyou can arouse that burning zeal--that ardor by which you are determined to\nprove to the Lord that you want Him more than playthings--then He will come.\nOut of that silent crying, Christ Consciousness will be born in you.\n\nYou can mentally experience all the emotions and trials of Jesus, or of any\nother great master who has attained liberation, and by resurrecting your soul\nwisdom you can rise above those experiences and conquer them. If you can med-\nitate deeply on God, some day you will be able to go through these experiences\nin the Christ-conscious state. So bring Christ Consciousness closer. Mentally\ngo through the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, and you will get the lesson\nthat he learned. It can be done. But you must meditate deeply upon it. You can\nattain understanding and devotion by meditation upon his experiences. And with\nevery kindness and every good action that you perform you are immediately in\ntune with his divine consciousness. You have then made a new altar for Christ.\nHe will instantly commune with you through your goodness.\n\n"}

It is a beautiful thought that we, although\nhuman, can also be divine like him.\n\nWhen we achieve Christ-consciousness, by improving our thoughts and our\nactions, we shall laugh at the dream of death and shall be resurrected in the\nfreedom Jesus attained. What he could achieve, we too can achieve, for it was\nsaid of Jesus: ''But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become\nthe sons of God\" (and, as sons of God, attain victory over death).

Awaken yourself in Christ Consciousness. You can\nnot only experience the life of Jesus in visions, but you can practice resurrection\nevery day of your life. First, forget your old weaknesses andtroubles. Just\nthink: \"Christ was resurrected, and Iam resurrected too, for Iam no longer\nmy old self.''

Believe what I am telling you.\n\nWhenever you do away with ignorance and think good thoughts, Christ is\nbeing resurrected within you. Do you see? Resurrection is not the power of\nSpirit in the body of Jesus only; Spirit is in everyone. It is not necessary for\nman to die in order to resurrect Spirit.

He resolved inwardly to leave his princely surroundings\nand go in quest of truth, in search of a master who would solve for him the enig-\nma of life. Whenever the prince returned to his palace, he was always moody\nand remained aloof from his beautiful wife, courtiers, and friends. His father,\nupon inquiry, discovered the reason for Siddhartha's moodiness, and immediate-\nly doubled the guard in his palace, giving strict orders never again to let the\nprince out where he could see what is ugly in the world.\n\nLife for the Prince went on in this manner for some time, until one night\ndivine love possessed Siddhartha; its intoxication was even greater than his\n| । conjugal love, or the tender love he felt for his newborn baby. Sitting on his\nbed, he gazed upon the beautiful faces of the queen and their infant son by the\nglimmering, dim light from the oil lamp in his palatial room, and he reasoned\nthus:\n\n"}

I love my baby because God gave me the life and love and intelli- | ।\ngence to love him. That is why I should love God more than my family, for I\ncould not love them without borrowing life and the power to love from God.\"\n\nFeeling this divine impulse and the call of God--who tests His devotees as\nto whether they love Him more than His gifts of family and wealth and relatives\nand friends--Prince Siddhartha cautiously arose. Gently he awakened his chari-\noteer, and commanded him to equip the royal chariot for a trip beyond the garden\nwalls. The charioteer remonstrated, but to no avail. Reluctantly he prepared\nfor the journey. But the questim then arose as to how the palace gates could\nbe opened; for they were guarded by watchful sentries.\n\nIt has been said that when the devotee is ready, God responds in mysterious\nways. So it happened that when Siddhartha was ready, the sentries, according\nto the divine wish, were suddenly overtaken with a stupefying sleep. Thus it\nwas that Prince Siddhartha's golden chariot soon raced out from behind the im-\nprisoning walls of the palace. Farther and farther away it rolled. Arriving at\na woodland spot, the Prince commanded that the chariot be stopped. Siddhartha\nalighted and, parting with his princely costume, asked the charioteer to exchange\nhis plain clothes for the rich attire.\n\nAfter thus transforming himself, Siddhartha, despite the lamentations of the\ncharioteer--and his own thoughts of a relinquished palace and beautiful wife and | ।\nson--briskly walked away, barefooted, into the jungle.\n\nSiddhartha at first practiced many auSsterities and sought to overcome the\nflesh by fasting and discipline. Still he found no peace within, and his hungering\nSpirit remained unappeased. At last he went to Bodh Gaya. There he seated\nhimself under a banyan tree, and with great determination made the following\nresolution:\n\n\"Beneath the banyan bough\n\nOn sacred seat I take this vow:\n\nUntil life's mystery I solve,\n\nUntil I gain the Priceless Lore,\n\nThough bones and fleeting flesh dissolve,\nI'll leave this posture nevermore. \"'\n\nThere he remained, according to the legend, without food or drink for\nseven years.

When you\nare in tune with that consciousness, which is beyond all creation, then you will\nsee that God begat creation in the womb of His intelligence. The intelligence in\nall creation, which is the reflection of the intelligence beyond all creation (God\nthe Father), is called Christ Consciousness, the Only Begotten Son. In India it\nis called Krishna Consciousness.\n\nKrishna (or Christna) of India was Jadava, whose consciousness was in tune\nwith the Intelligence that is in all creation. And Christ was Jesus, whose con-\nsciousness was in tune also with the Intelligence in everything. These two great\nones had found that behind all life is the One Life. They had withdrawn their\nconsciousness and seen that behind everything is the one reflection of God--the\none Son of God--Christ, or Krishna Consciousness. Jesus, Jadava, Buddha,\nBabaji-all are Christs; that is, they expanded their consciousness to receive the\nuniversal Christ Consciousness.\n\nTHE THREE MINDS The change from life to death is merely a passing from\none dream to another dream. It is only a thought.\n\nFirst you are dreaming that you are alive, and then you are dreaming that you are\n\ndead.

No. And yet\nmost of them are there waiting to be recalled, for your subconscious mind regis-\nters the thoughts that were outstanding. The main events of your life are all\nrecorded in your consciousness. God has given you, first, the conscious mind,\nwhich is more or less limited. At the end of several minutes--or days or months\nor years--your conscious mind begins to forget certain thoughts and events, but\nyour subconscious mind contains the memory vaults, and everything of impor-\ntance is stored there.\n\nNow behind the subconscious mind is your superconscious mind, which never\nforgets anything you ever did. At the time of your death the superconscious mind\nwill have kept a record of everything you have done, every thought you have enter-\ntained, and all these things will flash before you at the time you leave the body.\nYour strongest impressions will determine your next life's environment and\nhabits.\n\nEven as an ego--a saul living in body consciousness--your consciousness\ncan be everywhere, for thought has no boundaries and you are present in each\nthought you have. If you can reach superconsciousness, beyond thought, then\nyou can watch all your thousands of thoughts from that vantage.

We love to carry out ideas\nthat are for our own benefit.\n\nAll of us find ourselves more or less fenced in by our desires and experi-\nences. A person is free when he is through with being influenced by customs and\nconventions and is guided in all his actions by discriminative wisdom. Above all,\nwe can best distinguish truth from error when we are free from those habits and\ncustoms that have been imposed upon us. When we are free from all prejudices\nand customs, we can see, without malice, what is right and what is wrong about\ndifferent nationalities--but not until then.\n\nAs your range of experience begins to increase, you begin to stretch your\nconsciousness, which is expandable like rubber and will never break.

I could not distinguish between my brother\nand anyone else. Later, when I went to Master, he said, ''Your training is fin-\nished. You feel the same love for all.'' Master knew my thoughts and feelings.\nMy guru was not interested in what people were saying, but in what they were\nthinking. He was always conscious of everything that was going on, always calm.\nHe had expanded his consciousness into Christ Consciousness.\n\nSYMPATHY AND The world is yours. All space and everything in creation\nUNSELFISHNESS is yours. When you realize this, then you are in Christ\n\nConsciousness. You should strive mightily to reach that\nconsciousness wherein you realize and feel that everything is yours and you have\nno prejudices about race or color. When you begin to feel the hearts of others,\nthen you are developing Christ Consciousness. When you have that conscious-\nness, you have the love of a million mothers in your heart, you have love for\neverybody. You feel it, not just imagine it. That is the kind of love Jesus had.\n\nThis sympathy develops by practicing the transcendental way of meditation.\nThe superconscious-minded man is one who is always happy and always wise,\nand who retains the aftereffects of meditation. If you can retain without any\neffort the expanded state of consciousness that you feel after fruitful meditation,\nthen you have superconsciousness. And Christ Consciousness comes after super-\nconsciousness.\n\nBe sincere with all; and above all, be sincere with yourself. God watches\nyou. You can't deceive Him. In your heart there must be sympathy that takes\naway all pain from the hearts of others. That is what Jesus had when he said,\n\"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they 40. \" He had that great love\nof the Christ Consciousness for all. He could have destroyed all his captors with\na look. As God is constantly forgiving us, even knowing all our thoughts, so\nthose who are fully in tune with Him naturally have that same love.\n\nMETAPHYSICAL There are many people who read a few books and then say\nWAY TO CHRIST that they have Christ Consciousness. You can have that\nCONSCIOUSNESS only through meditation and self-disciplinary effort. God\n\nis the whisper in the temple of your conscience and God\nis the light of intuition. You know when you are doing wrong. Your whole being\n\n"}

If you do not listen to Him, then He\n\nbecomes quiet; but when you spiritually awaken again, He will guide you. He is\nalways waiting for the time when you will return home.

Your con-\nsciousness is not limited by this body, but when it is expanded you will sense the\nfeelings of all peoples. You will be able to know all about them. Marvelous\nrealizations will come to you. Sometimes when that state comes you will be able\nto feel yourself in the stars and in the moon, and in every blade of grass. You\nwill think: ''He whom I was seeking outside of myself--in the stars and the\nclouds--I found within myself! What a revelation! He is within whom I searched\n\nfor without. \"'\n२८२८»\n\nTHE PRINCE WHO BECAME A BEGGAR -- Part 3\n\nAfter years of severe fasting, Prince Siddhartha looked barely alive; his body\n\n` had become so thin that he looked almost like a skeleton. But he continued his\n\nextraordinary communion. One night as he sat in meditation some beautiful\nwomen appeared and danced around him; they were demons who had come through\nthe instrumentality of Mara (Satan) to tempt him to give up his’ loving search for\nGod and to enjoy the frivolities of material life. But Prince Siddhartha smote the\nearth and said, with great determination: ''Mara (Cosmic Delusion), I have con-\nquered thee. Tempt me no more.\" As if by magic, all the dancing forms (mate-\nrialized subconscious visions of hidden material desires) vanished. He perceived\nwithin himself an ocean of peace and wisdom. From that time on, Gautama was\nreferred to as the ''Buddha\" or the ''Awakened One.\"\n\nNext morning a princess visited him and gave him a rice preparation to eat.\nShe told him that it was not necessary to fast so long, weakening his body, in\norder to attain Self-realization. Self-realization, she said, could be attained\nthrough concentration, deep meditation, and continuous inner love of God; it is not\nnecessary to torture the body, which is a temple of God.\n\nThus the princess acted as a divine intermediary to instruct Gautama Buddha\nthat he could attain spiritual realization only through the Spirit within, not through\nmere physical discipline of the body.\n\nGaining great strength of body and spirit, Buddha, garbed as a mendicant,\nwent all over India preaching to thousands of people the way of complete renuncia-\ntion. His message spread like wildfire, and hundreds followed him. Even his\n"}

His\nnoble \"eightfold path'' taught how to escape misery and free oneself from the\nkarmic wheel of birth and death. One of the principles he emphasized (and\nillustrated in his own life) was the doctrine of mercy, not only for human beings,\nbut for all animals. One day as he was passing through the estate of a feudal\nprince of India, he saw that the people were about to sacrifice a little lamb before\nthe temple, and that the ceremony was presided over by the local ruler himself.\nSo keenly did Buddha feel the presence of universal life, even in animals, that he\nwas painfully shocked at the pitiful sight. Walking up to the prince, Buddha\nbegged him to spare the life of the little lamb, offering himself as a sacrifice in\nits stead. Touched by the sincerity and deep love manifested by Gautama Buddha,\nthe prince agreed to spare the lamb, and, far from sacrificing Buddha, he and\nall his subjects became followers of the Enlightened One.\n\nIn different periods of world civilization, the great teachers of those eras\ntaught their particular doctrines according to the different needs of human beings\nat the time. When there is a lack of wisdom, a great teacher appears on earth\npreaching wisdom. When there is a lack of love, a great teacher appears on\nearth bearing a message of love. Jesus Christ bore the message of devotion and | ।\nwisdom to the world. Buddha bore a message of mercy for all beings.\n\nMany followers of Buddha misunderstood his doctrines, and in some countries\nhis teachings degenerated into a nihilistic philosophy: 11012 ८2.72.11 was interpreted\nas extinction rather than as God-communion, the great Goal of life. Many of his\ndevotees turned to Swami Shankara, who established the doctrine that freedom\nfrom reincarnation (i.e., nirvana or extinction of the desires that keep man bound\nto the wheel of reincarnation) is not only the goal of life; but that it constitutes\nan expansion of consciousness--a positive attainment--of ever-existing, ever-\nconscious, ever-new Bliss, or God.\n\nek\nAFFIRMATION\nAll the veils of my ignorant inner life\n\nare burned in the light of my awakening in\nChrist.\n\n"}

Life and Truth are ever existent, but must become Self-\nconscious in each individual through the light of Self-realization. It is through\nthis constant expansion of the light of realization in all matter that each man-\nifestation is uplifted to a higher vibratory expression of the Infinite.\n\nUpon man rests the final responsibility, through his power of attunement\nwith Infinite Intelligence, to lift matter into Spirit. You are one with the In-\nfinite Intelligence, you are one with the Infinite Flame of Life now! In medita-\n| tion this realization floods your being, and one day it will leave you no more,\n7 | ॥ but will burn steadily forever in eternal bliss.\n\nLESSON NO. 105 Truth is ever existent, ready to pour itself into the cup\n\nof your realization; but the amount of truth that you can\nperceive is dependent upon your own capacity, your intelligence and intuition.\nThe faculties required to know truth must be developed. The only proof of the\ntruth contained in the scriptures is in living the life, and in the knowledge at-\ntained through intuition gained thereby. Intellectual study alone will never\nbring perception of truth. You may know all the facts about sugar, but you do\nnot know its flavor until you taste it. And so it is with truth, which must be\nintuitively experienced. Pure intelligence, pure feeling, calm reason, and\nmeditation lead to intuitional realization. Experience truth yourself. That is\nthe only method by which you may test the scriptures.\n\nIncessant and indiscriminate study of religious books should be avoided,\nas it usually results in mental and emotional indigestion. Spiritual truths\nshould be studied a little at a time and meditated upon for hours or days to-\ngether. Studied in the correct way for perception, they should be a perpetual\ninspiration and source of continual spiritual nourishment. By the very nature\nof realization, even a knave, once perceiving and realizing truth, could be a\nknave no longer.\n\n@ The scientist experiments with things outside himself. The metaphysi-\ncian experiments with what is within himself. The scientist deals with infer-\nential knowledge dependent upon data furnished by the senses. The power of\n\n"}

Intuition developed in meditation\ncannot be wrong. Intuition is the power that tests truth. The whole philosophy @\nof the East is based upon intuitive experience.\n\nMany people have talked about God, have wondered about Him, and read\nabout Him; but few have tasted the nectar-bliss of His presence. Only those\nwho taste Him know Him. If you find God within, you will find Him without--\neverywhere; but if you try to find Him without, not having first sought Him with-\nin, you will never find Him. If you follow the path of Self-realization stead-\nfastly and meditate regularly, you will see Him in the golden robe of light,\nspread throughout eternity.\n\nLESSON NO. 106 Spirit is. Spirit is the Unmanifested Absolute--vibra- `\ntionless, without beginning or end, ever-existing, ever-\nconscious, ever-new Joy. God the Father is Manifested Absolute, the first\nvibratory projection of Spirit. God, the Creator, is the Christ intelligence,\nwhich further appears as the cosmic intelligent vibration or Holy Ghost, which\nin turn appears as the cosmic intelligent energy, or cosmic sound of Om.\nThe ''faithful and true witness\" mentioned in the scriptures refers to this in-\ntelligent cosmic vibration, the Holy Ghost, or sacred vibration, cognizable to\nthe human being as the cosmic sound, ''Om,\" heard in silence, and the spiri-\ntual eye seen in meditation.\n\nVibration is a force, and it is organized by cosmic intelligence manifest-\ning as matter in its varied forms.\n\nThe consciousness in creation is called \"(४४150 Consciousness. ' The\nhuman body is a miniature universe; our consciousness is the microcosmic re-\nflection of Christ Consciousness. Because our consciousness is busy with the\nbody and the mundane world, it does not hear the voice of creation. However,\nby listening to the cosmic sound that is emanating from the cosmic energy,\nyour consciousness will become one with it. Through that contact, your con-\nsciousness expands to behold everything; then you attain Christ Consciousness.\nThe only approach to this consciousness is through the Holy Ghost, ''the faith-\nful witness.'' When you hear the cosmic sound, and your consciousness is\na. with it, then you are one with Christ. Receive the light of God through\nthat sound, and know that the little bubble of your life is embraced by the great\nocean of all life.\n\nThe idea-universe (causal or ideational), is the cause of the subtle uni-\nverse (astral or finer forces), which in turn is the cause of the material uni-\nverse (grosser vibrations). The universe is divine-intelligence-molded mat-\nter.\n\nLESSON NO. 107 God first created the forces of electrical, thermal, and\nelectronic laws and matter in idea only, by the law of\nrelativity, or duality of thought.

Then the Spirit of God, or intelligence of God, vi-\nbrated upon the mentally created elements. God said, 'Let there be light, and\nthere was light.'' The entire universe is made of electrons that are called\n\"Light. \" All the manifested universe is made of light rays, or different vibrations\nof light. God looked upon the light and saw that it was good, and serviceable\n\nin His work of creation--that it could be vibrated into myriad manifestations\naccording to the manifold relativity of His thought.\n\nThe cosmic light was divided into fine elements and gross elements\nthrough the medium of intervening space. The firmament in the midst of the\nwaters, dividing the waters from the waters, is called ''space,'' and is a dis-\ntinct vibration separating the finer from the grosser forces. It separates the\nastral from the physical. 1६ is the boundary line between heaven and earth. It\nis the receptacle of the finer forces. All angels, all sounds, all finer forces--\nas electricity, for example--are hidden in space. Science has made inroads\ninto space and has drawn electricity for man's use, and has drawn also some\nvibrations to be heard by the human ear through the use of radio.\n\nOur sight, hearing, smell, and taste are limited to perceiving this finite\nworld. The spiritual eye is the pearly gate through which our wisdom must\npass in order to pierce space and behold the other world, which in reality lies\nall about us. If our ears were attuned, we could hear the music of the spheres.\nOnly through meditation can we break the shell of finiteness, and thus, through\nthe expansion of-our comsciousness; become aware of the infinite beauty in `\nspace.\n\nLESSON NO. 108 \"And the evening and the morning were the second day. ''\nWe must remember that, from a scientific standpoint, a\n\"day'' means a cycle of many years taken by light to become the subtle ele-\nments, and for the subtle elements to change into the gases and gross nebulae\nthat eventually became condensed into water and dry land. A \"day\" or cycle\nmeans millions of years, the time required to express a particular phase of\ncreation. The waters (elements) began to move under the intelligent vibration-\nal force of God, and to draw together or separate, according to the ideational\npicture, at the command of God. For first there came mental or ideational\nae | then astral creation, and finally material creation.\n\nAll things in the universe attract one another; thus the \"influence\" of plan-\nets is simply one's environment, which is dependent upon his own karma. It\n18 you who attract such influence or environment and allow it to control you.\n\nIf you let yourself be governed by an environment to which your karma has\ndrawn you, then you are ruled by vibrations of the planets. It is true that you\nmay have attracted from a former life that influence which is present in this\nlife, but you need not allow it to continue. You were given the power of domin-\nion.

Man was\n\ncreated according to the images and plans evolved by these subjective offspring.\n\nThus \"us'' is the differentiated consciousness, or manifestations, of God the\nFather.\n\nThe presence of God the Father is manifested in the material universe as\nChrist Consciousness, the divine intelligence that guides the activities of cos-\nmic vibration or Holy Ghost. Hence the Christ Consciousness is spoken of as\n\"the only begotten of the Father,'' 1, €, , the only reflection of the Father in\ncreation.\n\nThe Christ intelligence immanent in creation differentiates itself into six\nsubjective creative intelligences: Iswara, Hiranyagarva, Birat, Pragnya, Tai-\njas, and Biswa. Each of these six reflections of the Christ intelligence in cre-\nation governs one of the six objective reflections of the Holy Ghost or Cosmic\nVibration: the macrocosmic ideational, astral, and physical universes; and\nthe microcosmic ideational, astral, and physical bodies.\n\nStudy carefully the chart and the outline in this Lesson. Familiarize your-\nself with the names of the six spirits, or differentiated forms of consciousness\ngoverning the six objective manifestations of vibratory creation. Cosmic Con-\nsciousness, whether present microcosmically or macrocosmically in the uni-\nverse, is the same; it is only designated differently in reference to universal\nor individual appearance or manifestation.\n\nAs in a general way the President and Congress govern the United States,\nso it can be said that God the Father beyond creation, reflected as Christ in\ncreation, rules the vibratory cosmos. And as the fifty states of America are\nruled by the President, Congress, Governors, and other officials, so it can be\nsaid that the vibratory creation is ruled by God the Father, God the Son or\nfirst reflection, and His six reflections. In order to understand the objective\nplane one must study and understand the subjective plane. In order to under-\nstand the so-called ''mysterious universe, '' one must know how it is governed\nby God and the ''seven angels before His throne. '' The cosmos works under a\ndefinite plan. The stars, moon, sun, seasonsdo not change mysteriously, but\naccording to a definite plan modified by the free will of man.\n\nMan is a part of the earth, and his consciousness seems limited to the\nbody; but when he hears Om, the vibration moving through the three creations\n--ideational, astral, and physical--and when his consciousness expands, he\nfeels Christ Consciousness.

But he must first feel Christ Consciousness in all crea-\ntion.\nLESSON NO. 110 The Spirit is knowledge plus feeling. Reason and feeling\n\nare expressed in different bodies. It can be said that\nman represents God, and woman represents Nature. These two are equal in\ndivine expression. In man (positive pole) reason is predominant and feeling\nsubjective. In woman (negative pole) feeling is predominant and reason sub-\njective. The spiritual marriage consists in woman, or feeling, uniting with the\nknowledge of God-created man or masculine force, and thus becoming one in\nSpirit.

In the original plan of creation, man and woman, ideal\nsoul mates, were to lead a heavenly life by keeping their minds in the heaven-\nly region of bliss-will in the forehead. Man's being placed in a ''garden east-\nward in Eden'' means that he was originally in that center of consciousness in\nbetween the eyebrows where the sun of the heavenly eye is seen.\n\nThe human body is the Garden of Eden. The spine is symbolized as the\nTree of Life, the tree of consciousness through which flows the sap of life in\norder that the blossoms of the senses and thoughts may flourish. The spinal\ncord is the trunk, the cranial nerves are the roots, and the afferent and effer-\nent nerves are the branches. ''Trees'' refers to various nervous systems.\n\"The fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden'' refers to the sensa-\ntion of sex, the fruit of the tree of sex nerves. To '\"'die'' here means to lose\ndivine consciousness. When Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of the tree of the\nknowledge of good and evil, their consciousness fell from the spiritual eye,\nand henceforth they had to depend upon the sight of their physical eyes alone.\nThey became body-conscious and were aware of their nakedness. ''The ser-\npent, '' the outgoing current of life energy stimulating the nerves of creative\nforce, tempted them to physical union, whereby they lost divine consciousness.\n\nAdam and Eve were empowered to create children after their hearts' de-\nsire by materializing the life force into a body by the immaculate method, even\nas God did in creating them. When man, instead of keeping his consciousness\non the Paradise spotin the region of pure thought at the Christ-consciousness\ncenter, allowed the mind to run down to the sex plane, he fell from being able\nto perform immaculate creation by will to the method of physical propagation.\n\nThe creative force that flows through the coiled passage in the coccyx is\ncalled the ''Kundalini Power'\"' in Hindu books.

To continue to disobey laws of right living is to\nॐ the forces of healing, because you continue to aggravate the cause of\nthe disease. If you are suffering and wish to be healed, prepare yourself now\nin the following ways:\n\n(1) be cheerful and optimistic of disposition;\n\n(2) obey the laws of good health (dietary, hygienic);\n\n(3) decide what method of healing you are most strongly inclined to put your\nfaith in (mental or medical healing) and then if you want help, go to that\n\n| ध type. of healer; oo ee\n(4) realize that whatever the instrument of healing, God is the power behind\nit--nothing can operate without God's power;\n(5) above all, destroy ignorance, for it is ignorance that leads to transgres-\nsions of every kind, which result in spiritual, mental, and physical\ninharmonies.\n\nElectricity and rays will be the medicine of the future.

Physiologi-\ncal nervousness may be destroyed by harmonious environment and correct eating\nhabits.

In the realization of your\ngreater self, you no longer find yourself limited to the little body and all of its @\nsensations. At last you realize that you are the Intelligence behind this body,\n\nthe infinite Joy. Use your nerves to drink the honey of infinite Peace.\n\nLESSON NO. 112 Before one can have faith in mental healing, it is first\n\nnecessary to understand the relation of mind to body.\nOtherwise, lingering doubt may remain in the back of the mind and neutralize\nthe constructive thought. Then one may lose what little faith existed. Under-\nstand the laws, then develop your will power. Will and energy are the two most\neffective powers inthe system. Will controls energy. It is not the will that\nheals, but it is the will that rouses the energy. There is no greater or more\neffective force than energy applied by will power. They are the real creators of\nthe body. To be active and successful, a thought must be impregnated with such\nwill power that it will resist everything and materialize. Remember: if you\nheal the soul, the body will be automatically healed.\n\nIn preparation for healing another, you must first put the patient into a\nreceptive mood and instill faith. Use reason and suggestion. Your will power,\ntuned in with divine will, is the seed that must be planted. Do not try to healany-—\none who doubts you, for then the patient's will is not tuned in with yours. The\npatient's will must be tuned with yours, and yours must be tuned with divine will.\n\nHuman will is the reflection of divine will and when guided by wisdom it is\nunlimited power. God's will controls the cosmic energy. Then, to send energy\ninto the body would require that you convert, or tune, your will into divine will.\n\nStudy carefully the technique of healing given inthis lesson. The life force\ncoming through the medulla is the direct source of life. Your part as healer\nis to contact that current directly and send it through your spiritual eye into\nthe spiritual eye of your patient.

At first, this truth dawns upon you gently, then as the mighty\n\n । realization floods your consciousness, you know that all outer change is due\nonly to your concentration upon environment and body appetite. You can keep\nyour world steady and harmonious by concentrating upon the inner changeless\nspark of life, which is the real you. You must not neglect the body and its\nneeds; but you will find that its needs become fewer as you advance in the prac-\ntice of these principles.

You fear change because you do not understand it. Your attention\nis upon the change instead of upon its cause. This fear is due to bodily conscious-\nness. There are two vital steps on the way to immortality. One is to rechemi-\ncalize your body through meditation, work, food, etc. The other is retention of\nconsciousness upon the plane of changelessness. Then you will know that there\nis no death.

It is ever existing, ever conscious, ever\nnew joy that all mankind is seeking. Through experience man learns that earthly\npleasures are fleeting. Usually he finds that when he gets a thing he wanted,\nhe is still dissatisfied, and so he follows desire after desire, never finding com-\npletion or perfect happiness. The joy of meditation is that awareness of Reality,\nthat perception of God, by which love for God is born. With that love--that joy\n--in your soul, you are divine and know immortality.

Impris-\noned divine love in the human heart breaks the bars of selfishness and begins to\nspread itself in parental, conjugal, and family love. Then it breaks the bars |\n—, communal, patriotic and national consciousness, and includes the love of all\nliving creatures. Then divine love extends its love ecstasies to the region of\nmute stars, distant’sun furnaces, and rings of dancing starlets. And so divine\nlove finds itself back in the bosom of Omnipresence, all melted in Oneness.\n\nDo not impede the course of divine love by limiting attachments, which end\nin satiety. Love expands in increasing qualities of usefulness. Develop ever\nincreasing, divinely emancipating usefulness--unconditional, impersonal.

That is why, if you are near--\nand especially if you tune in with persons of highly developed soul magnetism--\nyou feel an expansion of your own consciousness, a keen awareness and an\nawakening of your discriminative power and intuition.\n\nOne who meditates on Om and God day and night, and intuitively perceives\nthe all-attracting divine magnetism, develops spiritual magnetism of limitless\nrange and power. By meditation one contacts this higher magnetism and goes\nconsciously toward God, at the same time attracting others into this unifying\nand uplifting plane of consciousness.\n\nThe Satanic force is an expulsive force going out from God and finitely cre -\nating; hence reincarnation, the law of cause and effect, and the power of desire\nborn of contact with finite matter.

Do you\n\nrealize how much that statement explains? Anything of which you are cognizant\n\nhas a relative vibration within yourself. One who is quick to see and judge evil\n\nin other persons has the seed of that evil within himself. The Godlike person of\n\npure and high vibrational tone is always aware of the God~spark in all he contacts,\n\nand his magnetic soul vibration draws to greater intensity that vibrational force\n\nin those who come within his vibrational range. Everything in creation has a\n\ndifferent rate of vibration. The different rates of vibration balanced in the cosmic\n\nrhythm produce before us the majestic cosmos.\n\n७ Soul vibration results when a person is always conscious of the presence of\nGod. The vibration of God is the most intelligent of all and produces perfect har-\nmony. When you let that vibration pass through you, all other vibrations become\nharmonized. And that is why, when you tune in with the cosmic Om vibration, you\nbecome conscious in all creation; you are in Christ Consciousness.\n\nIf your vibrations are in harmony with divine intelligence and love, you will\nexpress that harmony in your environment in personality, form, color, action.\n\"Seek ye first the kingdom of God\" (Matthew 6:33).\n\nAny hindrances to the expression of this divine harmony through you are\nes you have created, or allowed to accumulate: attachment, prejudice,\nhabit, concentration on the senses, and so forth. Find out what your own hin-\ndrances are by becoming aware of them, and then eliminate them. The vibrations\nof reason and feeling must be in perfect balance. As one meditates deeply and\nunites soul with Spirit, this balance of pure reason and pure feeling is expressed\nin the highest degree. Dispel all inharmonious vibrations from your life by\nmeditating regularly and deeply. Let the Om vibration, conjoined with the music\nof the spheres, dispel all darkness within you and bring joy and understanding to\nyour heart.\n\n@ In order to receive the vibrations of others, you should first harmonize the\nfeeling in the heart; free it of all prejudice and emotion.

This is more reliable than mental judgment, but you must\nfirst be sure that you are free of all attraction, repulsion, prejudice, and other\n\ndisturbing emotions.\n\nBeyond the land of peace, beyond the land of dreams, beyond the land of\nsilence, lies the garden of Self-realization. When God's power is flowing through\nyou, you are a divine magnet.\n\nLESSON NO. 118 \"Cleanliness is next to godliness.'' The ceremony of\n\nbaptism by water symbolizes the purification necessary to\nspirituality. Cleanliness of the body is a first step in living the spiritual life.\nHowever, it becomes meaningless unless followed by the second step, the cleans-\ning and purifying of the mind. These but prepare for and symbolize the spiritual\nbaptism, the baptism by the Holy Ghost.\n\nPhysical life cannot continue without water. Water cools the nerve endings\nand sends a report of cool sensations throughout the vital centers, thus evenly\nbalancing the vital energies. Water opens the pores of the skin, letting out dis-\nturbing body poisons, which in turn calms and soothes the whole organism. Immer-\nsion in water, therefore, has a definite though temporary effect upon the conscious-\nness. If you again put on your bad physical and mental habits when you come out\nof the water, there will be no lasting good. But if you meditate immediately after\nbathing, you will feel the real power of baptism by water. | ।\n\nConsciousness, life force, and the body are different rates of conscious cos-\nmic vibration, held together by the nucleus of the ego and soul. In order to free\nthe soul from the cage of these threefold vibrations, it has to be baptized or united\nwith the original cosmic vibration of Om. This sound, emanating from the vibra-\ntion of all atoms, is called the Holy Ghost or sacred vibration. Attunement with\nthe Om vibration sound heard in meditation is the way in which ordinary conscious-\nness can be baptized or expanded into Christ Consciousness through the expanding\npower of the Holy Ghost. When the yogi is able not only to hear this cosmic sound\nin his consciousness, but also to feel its actual presence in every unit of space,\nthe soul of the yogi becomes one with the Holy Ghost. This is baptism by the Holy\neee, An actual vibrational change takes place in this baptism. The body loosens\nits atomic vibrations and becomes life force. This life force at a higher rate of\nvibration becomes one with Cosmic Consciousness.\n\n\"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son\" to redeem it.\nGod so loved the world that His love (vibratory force) went forth into creation as\nChrist Consciousness or Christ Intelligence. This love, or Christ Consciousness,\nor only reflection, was consciously manifested in Jesus, the vehicle. To those\nwho received Him, meaning those who also received this reflection, or Christ\nConsciousness, they also, and they only, became sons of God, like Jesus. Those\nwho do not receive this vibratory baptism are not \"redeemed,\" or lifted up, until @\nthey do so.\n\n"}

Thus he was the Son of God, even as\nall men may be. He is the divine example, and his words are words of life and\nhope; for he says, ''What Ido, all men may 40. \" When the student feels his con-\nsciousness one with Christ Consciousness, he realizes that Christ Consciousness\nis the reflection of the Cosmic Consciousness of God the Father. Then, like\nJesus, he can say, \"I and my Father are One.\"\n\nLESSON NO. 119 If we know the truth, we shall know that truth is the same\neverywhere. It is only ignorance that prompts the follow-\ners of one religion to call others heathens. The similarity in religions, however,\ncannot be detected by intellectual reasoning alone. Self-realization is the only\nstandard by which we can judge religions, because in that alone do we have the\n[3 perception of eternal truth, which is one for all mankind. If the follow-\ners of all religions, and scientists too, would experiment with religion and dis-\ncover truth within their own selves, they would realize the common foundation\nin truth that all great religions possess. Know the truth, which alone can make\nyou free. Truth is not dependent upon religious or church affiliation.\n\nJadava, or Krishna (Christna), is the Christ of the Hindus, as Jesus is the\nChrist of the Christians, in that each was ''Christed;\" that is, the Christ Con-\nsciousness was exemplified-or-made-manifest in each: You have already learned\nthat Christ Consciousness is the consciousness that is present in every atom. The\nHindus call it Kutastha Chaitanya, and the Christians call it Christ Consciousness.\n\nHerein lies the first similarity in the two religions. You will note that\nalthough there were 3000 years between these two great men of God, each was\ngiven the same name: Christna, or Christ, indicating that they had attained the\nsame state of consciousness. Their lives also were similar in many aspects.\nFrom Christna came the teachings of the Bhagavad-Gita, the Hindu Bible; and\nfrom Christ came the teachings of the Christian Bible. In addition to the similar-\nity of the concept of Christ Consciousness, these scriptures have a second great\nsimilarity in the concept of one God; and a third similarity in the concept of the\nTrinity, the One in Three.\n\nThe metaphysical truth of the Trinity is as follows: Spirit existing alone\nbeyond all creation is one. The Holy Ghost is the vibrational universe, or ball of\nvibration, in which is reflected Christ Consciousness, or the only first reflection\n--the Son. Thus, as Spirit reflects in the ball of vibration (creation), it is the\nfirst cause, or Father of the Son (consciousness or intelligence in all creation).\nThus Spirit becomes the Father, the first of the Trinity. The reflection is the\nSon, the second of the Trinity. The ball of vibration (in which the reflection is\npresent) is the Holy Ghost, the third of the Trinity. So God the Father is the\nintelligence beyond all creation. Christ Consciousness is the intelligence in\ncreation. The Holy Ghost is the vibration itself.\n\n"}

No dream is too grand or too\nimpossible for this all-seeing eye of intuitive faith to bring into manifestation.\nFaith, or the intuitive experience of all truth, is present in the soul. Although\nthis intuitive faith is clouded over by human ignorance, its tendrils reach up\n\neven through this darkness to man's mind for his use; and rightly used, hope leads\nto the highest achievements.\n\nBelief differs from faith in this, that belief is the initial experimental feeling\nabout the truth of anything. Constructive belief is the attitude of mind necessary\nfor testing the truth about anything in the beginning. Untested belief crystallizes\ninto dogmatic sentiment or, if discouraged, it may change into skepticism. Con-\nstructive belief is good when one continually experiments until the real nature of\na truth is revealed. It results not in a turning away from truth, but in proving\ntruth. Faith is the soul's intuitive knowledge of all truth. It is the \"evidence of\nthings not seen\" (Hebrews 11:1), things incognizable by the limited power of the\nsenses. This instantaneous all-knowing, all-seeing power is developed through\ndeep meditation and soul contact.\n\nJust as your consciousness is present in every part of your body, so in cos-\nmic consciousness, your consciousness is present in all creation.

It is often more difficult\n\nto turn the searchlight on oneself in strict honesty, but that is what you must do\n\nin order to find out what improvement or change is necessary.

Matter does exist, but it is\nnot what it appears to be to the limited vision of human beings. Our senses\nare limited to but a few octaves in the vibratory scale. However, even this\nsense-awareness varies with different human beings, and it can be expanded\n@ consciously to such an extent that the walls of separativeness are broken\nthrough, and the true nature of matter perceived.\n\n"}

Because the percep-\ntion of cause was ignored, the understanding of its nature was lost. Thus pain\ndeveloped. When there is comprehension of cause, then pain is recognized as\nmental sensitiveness and not a physical condition. In such recognition lies the\npower to eliminate pain from the consciousness.\n\nThe delusions of nationality, caste, creed, etc., are due to the sense of\nseparateness.

Intelligence is consciousness,\never renewing, ever expressing, ever changing, but indestructible.\n\n2) The body is but the froth on the soul-wave, the grosser garment.\n\n3) Life is vagrant, like a river now onthe surface, now in deeper under-\nground caverns, appearing and disappearing.\n\n4) Life vibrates in changing forms. As ice, water, steam are different\nforms of the same thing, so different forms of life are manifesta-\ntions of the same life force.\n\n5) The Spirit in the vehicle, and the vehicle, are the same in essential\ncomposition.\n\nThe wise man of understanding, whose spiritual eye is opened, sees that\nthe illusive change called death is but a new beginning in another supernal life.\n\n"}

Yogis practice control of life and the breathless state to be\nable to live in airless regions of living light, unburdened by the body.\n\nLESSON NO. 126 The ignorance in which most people pass their existence\n\nis actually more deathlike than so-called death, which is\nmerely a step in the unfoldment of life. Attachment to the body, enslavement\nby the senses and blind material activity are stagnating and earth-binding, and\ntend to blight the true flowering of the soul in immortality.\n\nIt is all right to enjoy the good things of this life, but do not become at-\ntached to anything so that you suffer if it is taken from you. God takes things\nfrom you so that you will not remain earth-bound. You can never squeeze the\nhoney of divine happiness from the rock of sense pleasures.

You\nwill not take a big jump into angelhood, unless you reach that state before you\ndie.\n\nEverything lives, even a piece of tin, but life is ever changing, unfolding.\nDo not stay in your limited physical shell. Crack the space shell by the drill\nof - concentration and meditation, and allow your consciousness to expand\ninto the consciousness of immortality.\n\nYour question of redemption from the self-created prison of ignorance\nmust be settled directly by yourself and God. Jesus and a few other great ones\nhave come back to the earth with the same body after death, to show all man-\nkind that it is possible.\n\nLESSON NO. 127 The word resurrection has been greatly misunde:i stood\n\nin the Christian world. The soul does not need to wait\nfor death of the body to be resurrected. Nothing in life remains stationary.\nEverything is undergoing a process of change. Nothing dies; it merely changes\nform. Change is either detrimental or beneficial. Resurrection means any\nbeneficial or uplifting change.\n\n"}

Disease exists because you stimulate the race thought of\nyour forefathers, and thereby reinforce your ignorance. You weave the thread\nof fear, worry, and ignorance around you until disease and death claim the\nbody,and the soul is in darkness.\n\nYou must resurrect yourself mentally by dispelling ignorance and elimi-\nnating wrong habits. You only imagine yourself to be mortal. You must resur-\nrect your real face of life from beneath the superficially gathered soot of error.\nThen you will know that you were, are, and ever will be a perfect reflection\nof Spirit.

It is only by contact with\nGod that one sees that He is the universe and that the body is but condensed\nelectricity, which is energy or frozen Cosmic Consciousness.

Ev-\nery morning you are resurrected after sleep, but you drop back into old bad\nhabits again. You must consciously resurrect yourself in a threefold manner\nin order to come into your birthright.\n\nRESURRECTION:\n1) Physical:\n\na) Change and spiritualize the atoms of the body.\n\nb) Learn to relax body parts. This frees the internal organs, frees\nthe mental body from body consciousness; makes it possible to\nlive more by Cosmic Energy and less by food.\n\nc) Changes must be made by conscious effort while in this body.\n\n2) Mental:\n\na) Dispel ignorance.\n\nb) Free the mind of all such limitations as prejudice, instinct,\nhereditary tendencies due to karma, restlessness and\nindifference.\n\n"}

The Christ is being resurrected within you when you do good\ndeeds and kindnesses, and when you meditate. The Christ-Consciousness\ncenter has a location in your body. Your body is the temple of the living God.\nThat is why you must purify your body and mind by right living and good thoughts,\nthen meditate on the Christ-Consciousness center so that the consciousness\nmay freely permeate and free all your being.\n\nWhat Jesus achieved, all of us can achieve. He went into the ocean of Spir-\nit and came back again, replete with the power of God to show that life is im-\nmortal. Within the body of Jesus existed the universal Christ Spirit. He was\nboth human and divine, even as we are. But he overcame the flesh completely,\neven as we too can do.\n\nWe can be what we want to be, no matter what our past has been. We can\npractice resurrection every day of our lives. Each day is a new birth. Jesus\n-suffered,struggied,—and-won.—It takes effort,-but it can be done. That is the ~\ngreat message of Jesus' life to us all.\n\nLESSON NO. 129 We now see that resurrection consists of a threefold\n\nprocess of lifting the body, mind, and soul. When the\nconsciousness of every cell of the body, as well as the mind, and soul, is\nraised to the consciousness of omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence,\nthen we are in Christ Consciousness, are resurrected.\n\nAll of us find ourselves more or less fenced in by our own desires and ex-\nperiences. The beginning of the awakening of Christ Consciousness in us is\nwhen we raise our eyes from the limiting walls of selfishness, habit, imposed\ncustom, and personal experience, and stretch our consciousness to include\naffection, kindness, and service to others hitherto outside our personal circle.\n\nDefinite steps into Christ Consciousness are signified by steps into Christ Consciousness are signified by:\n\n1) Kindness and service to another without the desire for reciprocation.\n\n2) Freedom from prejudices, customs, and habits.\n\n3) Love for strangers as well as relatives. Lovefor your neighbor as\nfor yourself.

This process is repeat-\ned many times, until the soul fulfills its destiny and becomes reunited with\nSpirit. Reincarnation is necessary for the working out of the effects of man's\negoistic actions of many former lives, which are lodged as seed-tendencies in\n\nthe subtle bodies accompanying the soul in its passage from one body to another.\n\nReincarnation is a scientific doctrine. Although it originated in the reli-\ngions of the East, it may also be considered a Christian doctrine. We find in\nthe Christian Bible the same conception of reincarnation--the same universal\nlaws of finding God--as in the Hindu Bible (the Bhagavad-Gita). Reincarnation\nis one of the greatest doctrines; without the concept of reincarnation we cannot\nconceive, from the limited perspective of one life, the eternal justice of God.\nThree hundred million Hindus in India, one hundred and fifty million Buddhists,\nthe thousands who follow the Persian faith of the Magi, the ancient Jews, the\nearly Gnostics, and early Christians--in short, more than half the human race\n--have believed in some form of the doctrine of reincarnation.\n\nEvolutional reincarnation extends from inert crystals to the expressive\nhuman sphere of existence. After many lives in various animal bodies, the\nsoul passes to the body of aman. Matter suppresses Spirit, which is trying to\nreform it from within by evolutional coaxing. Reincarnation represents the\nprogressive stages through which Spirit returns from material embodiments to\nItself--from the many tothe One. The Gita says:\n\n11, , , but as when one layeth\nHis worn-out robes away,\nAnd, taking new ones, sayeth,\n'These will I wear today ! '\nSo putteth by the spirit\n\n"}

''\n\nTHE SOUL IS The law of conservation of energy is true in the subtle psychi-\nIMMORTAL cal world as well as in the physical world. The soul is im-\n\nmortal, hence the soul, though encased in a mortal body,\nexisted before and will exist in all future time. The significance of reincarna-\ntion cannot be understood intellectually; the immortality of the soul and its\ntransmigration from one life to another can be realized only when one con-\nsciously experiences the transitory states of sleep and death by practicing with\ndevotion the highest techniques of concentration and meditation. This is Self-\nrealization, recognition of one's own Self as eternal bliss, eternal conscious-\nness, eternal existence.\n\nOne life is not enough in which to purify ourselves sufficiently to commune\nwith Spirit. We must have time to work out our imperfections. Our immortal-\nity~-the pure soul within us--must have time to retrace its steps back to God.\nWe have come away from God and we must go back to Him. We cannot go back\nto the immortal state unless we become perfect, and to become perfect we must\nhave a number of lives to work out our desires and get back to God.\n\nThe soul, being immortal, outlives the body. But this immortal soul,\nwhile in the physical..body, puts on the mask of the ego and its imperfections,\nThe soul cannot go back to Spirit until it has removed those delusive imperfec -\ntions. Since they cannot be done away with in one life, the soul must reincar-\nnate in order to conquer them. It is erroneous to believe that by virtue of\nphysical death a soul goes back to God. If that were so, what would be the use\nof being good? Why not do all the things one desires to do, good or evil, if at\nthe end of life we go back to God anyway?\n\nGod sends immortal souls to this earth-school to enact a mortal drama\nwith the attitude of immortals. But souls, long in this school begin to forget\ntheir immortal nature; they circumscribe their omnipotence with limiting mor-\ntal desires. We should avoid mortal desires, because they prevent us from\nrealizing the 4 blissful, all-sufficing, immortal nature of the soul.\n\nGod did not mean that all mankind should retreat from an active, useful\nlife in the world to live like hermits. It would not even be possible for all men\ntodo so. Rather, the Gita points out: ''Perform all duties of worldly existence |\nwith the consciousness of God.\" In thus playing our roles in the drama of mor-\ntal life we please both God and man.\n\nIn the Bible we read: \"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the tem-\nple of my God, and he shall go no more out\" (Revelation 3:12). He who over-\ncomes the bodily desires will be a fixed soul (pillar)in the mansion of God's pres-\nence, and he will not have to go back to the earth inpursuit of the fulfillment\n\n"}

He who overcomes the desires of the body will\n\nnot come back to earth to taste the bittersweet fruits of earthly life, but will be\n\nable to enjoy God, or the ''Tree of Life, '' which is ever present in the paradise\nof ever living, divine happiness.\n\nAgain the Gita says: ''I, the Spirit, reincarnate Myself again and again in\norder to uplift the oppressed and redeem the virtuous. '' Lord Krishna and Lord\n\nJesus were two such divine incarnations.\n\nWe do not improve all at once, but gradually; many births give our souls and\nsubtle bodies a chance to improve. The difference in the temperament, nature,\ncapacity, and evolution of different members of the same family, having the same\nsurroundings and the same training, cannot be explained except through the doc-\ntrine of reincarnation. Impartial God would not create one person prosperous\nand another person poor; they are what they are as a result of their own actions.\nHowever, those who are fortunate should not callously leave to their ''fate'' those\nwho are not. People with good opportunities should help those with lesser oppor-\ntunities; otherwise they will develop apathetic karma that will spiritually degrade\nthem and ultimately make them poor.\n\nWhen a baby is born blind, is it because of some sin of his parents? No.\nThe baby transgressed some spiritual law in a previous life. Where does a per-\nson with equal good and bad karma go? Does he belong in Heaven or Hades?\nReincarnation for attainment of complete goodness solves this question.\n\nAVOID FORCED It is natural to want to live free, as the owner, and not be\n\nREINCARNATION thrown out of your bodily home. But your real home is\nomnipresence; you have forgotten that. Some day this\n\nlittle cage will be broken whether you want it so or not. Why not learn the way by\n\nwhich you can consciously go out of and return to the body, at will?\n\nTEE. Spirit alone existed He said, \"I want to become manifest. '' So by His\nlaw of evolution He expressed Himself in various inanimate forms until He even-\ntually became plant life. Then He thought, 7 express life and beauty in the\nplant, but I want to enjoy motion. '' Thus His feet were released from the earth\nand He manifested as animal life. In nature, God first realized His beauty in\nmanifestation, and in the animal He not only realized His beauty but also His\nsensibility. His voice began to sing in the nightingale, but He said, ''Well, I\nsing, but Iam not conscious of what I sing, '' so God became man. Then He\nbegan to express His reason. In man's power of thought, God's omnipresence is\nexpressed more than in other forms. Then God became the superman who real-\n\nizes his origin and oneness with God. In the superman, God is able to express | ।\nHis omnipresence; for He knows, even in a human body, that He is present in all\n\n"}

How to attain to that divine consciousness of your omnipresent God-\nnature, is what these lessons teach you.

Intoxicating Wine of Centuries! my devotion\nto Thee has been aging secretly throughout incarnations in the cask\nof my heart. Itap Thee at last, and quaff measureless draughts of\nThine unending joy.\n\naK\n\nLAWS OF REINCARNATION\n\nThe physical body is composed chiefly of sixteen chemical elements that\ncould be procured in a drugstore for about ninety-eight cents. Yet when the\nphysical body dies, we cannot recreate it from its constituent elements; nor\ncan we fashion a new one from chemicals purchased at a pharmacy. What\nsubtle forces determine the creation of a physical body? And what blueprint\ndetermines its various features?\n\nThe ancient yogis of India discovered that hidden within the physical body\nof man are two other bodies: the astral body composed of nineteen powers,\nand the causal or ideational body composed of thirty-five elemental \"ideas.\"\n\nThe soul, plus the ideational body, plus the astral body, plus the unful-\nfilled desires of past earthly lives and the karmic traces left by past earthly\nactions, are the forces that combine to compel man to enter a new earthly in-\ncarnation. ।\n\nSuppose you place a small corked jar of water inside another jar of water;\nand that you then cork the second jar and put it inside a third jar of water,\nwhich you also cork; and lastly, that you throw into the ocean the largest jar,\nwhich contains the other two jars. Obviously the water in the three corked\njars could not mingle with the ocean water. All three jars would be required\nto be uncorked before the water imprisoned within them could become a part\nof the ocean.\n\n।\n\nSimilarly, the corked outer jar of the physical body contains within it the\ncorked jars of the astral and ideational bodies. The soul, which permeates\nall three bodies, cannot mingle with the omnipresent ocean of Spirit because\nthe soul is held in its three bodily containers by the three corks of ignorance.\n\nTo give another illustration: it is as though man has three pieces of cloth-\ning--overcoat, suit, and undergarment. At the death of the physical body the\nsoul sheds only its \"overcoat\"; the soul is still wearing its \"suit\" of the astral\nbody and its 'undergarment\" of the ideational body. | ।\n\n"}

With each earthly incarnation the astral body must take on a new\nphysical body.\n\nThe causal or ideational body has thirty-five 'ideas, '' of which nineteen\nare instrumental in forming the astral body, and the balance (sixteen) supply\nthe \"ideas'' from which come the gross sixteen chemical materials that com-\npose the cells of the physical body.\n\nThe astral body is the repository of these nineteen ideas:\n1) intelligence (buddhi or mahatattwa);\n2) egoism (ahankara);\n3) heart or emotion or feeling (chittwa)\n4) mind or sense-consciousness (manas)--ability to perceive\nthrough the senses; this is the mind that is chiefly operative\nin all beings; but the more they employ of intelligence (buddhi),\n\nthe more discrimination and judgment they display.\n\nAfter these four come the remaining fifteen ideas in the form of three\nsets of powers (five powers in each set):\n\na) five instruments of KNOWLEDGE:\n\nthe subtle astral powers that enable the physical\nsenses to see, hear, smell, taste, and touch;\n\nb) five instruments of EXECUTION or ACTION:\n\npower to procreate (sexual organ);\nto excrete (rectum);\nक | talk (mouth);\n\nto walk (feet);\n\nand to exercise manual skill (hands);\n\nOP WN &\n\nc) five instruments of LIFE FORCE:\n\nthe five forms of prana by which the physical body is main-\ntained; the five vital airs that carry on the crystallizing,\nassimilating, eliminating, metabolizing, and circulating\nfunctions.\n\nIf the crystallizing current in the body is not functioning properly, some\ndisease such as tuberculosis may start.

All nineteen astral body powers are interrelated with\nthe physical body; hence illness may affect any of the subtle senses dwelling in\nthe ten astral organs of sensibility: the seeing, listening, tasting, smelling,\nand touching powers; and the powers of action in the hands, feet, tongue, and\nin the genital and rectal muscles.\n\nAt physical death, man, encased in his astral and causal bodies, goes to\nthe astral world. There he remains for a certain time (the span is karmically\ndetermined). Then he again takes a physical form in order to reap the results\n(karma) of former actions during previous physical incarnations, and to work\nout all earthly desires that have not been fulfilled.\n\nDesire is the fundamental cause of rebirth. Performing actions with ego-\nistic desire for a particular result leaves traces in the mind, whereas per-\nforming actions without selfish attachment to their fruits does not leave traces\n(1. €. , does not create any new mental patterns of binding karma). Strong ego-\nistic desires in connection with ambitions or with one's relationships during\nearthly life (such as with family, friends, country) are bonds that tie man to\nthe earth and to reincarnations there.\n\nIf you are sick or frail during most of this life you will attract a future\nphysical body with similar weaknesses unless you have learned the karmic les-\nson involved. If you are healthy now, you will attract a healthy body again--\nprovided you have properly but in a detached way cared for this one, and pro-\nvided that you have not been unsympathetic toward those less healthy, and so\non. Similarly, if you are wealthy, you are likely to be attracted to a wealthy\nhome again, and if on the other hand you have a consciousness of poverty or\nlack at the time of death, the karmic tendency created by your mind will cause\nyou to reincarnate ina poor home. Best of all is to be born into a family of\nspiritually minded people. Each man attracts to himself the parents and en-\nvironment that he has earned.\n\nWhat you are now, you have brought upon yourself by what you have been;\nwhat you are now you will be, unless you are making a real effort to change\nyour consciousness, habits, and desires. Your present is determined accord-\ning to your past, and your future (your environment in the next life) will depend\nupon the essence of your thoughts in the last moments of this life. The trend\nof your entire life will come before you then, and your character will thus de-\ntermine the kind of body, mind, and environment you will have in the next life.\n\nIt is natural to wonder if, after physical death, one is reborn on earth im-\nmediately. Just as some people sleep a long time and others sleep only a\nlittle while, so in the astral world some souls wake up quickly after the sleep\nof physical death, and desire to return to earth; while others remain for hun- ७\ndreds of years in the astral world. Spiritual people may remain for a long ©\ntime in the astral world or may quickly take a new physical body, as they\nplease,\n\n"}

The physical\nsenses are merely instruments of the subtle as-\ntral senses, which are the real organs. Only the mode of expression is de-\npendent on the physical instruments of sense. However, even though the physi-\ncal sense-telephones of the eyes and ears may be damaged or dead, the power\nof sight and hearing remain in the astral body; the physical eyes may be blind\nbut the astral eyes can still see. A blind person may see in a dream, for\nthen he would be using his astral power of sight. It is the same with hearing\nand the other senses. Man can freely use all ten senses in the astral body.\nIn his dreams each night man employs his astral senses; everything a person\ncan do in the physical body, and much more, can be performed in the dream\nworld by the power of mind acting through the ten subtle senses and the five\ninstruments of life force. The phenomena of dreams are proof of the astral\nnature of sense perceptions and provide a clue to the nature of the astral world.\n\nIDEATIONAL OR The ideational or causal body has thirty-five \"ideas, ''\nCAUSAL BODY as has been explained earlier in this lesson. When God\n\nfirst created the thirty-five elemental \"ideas\" that com-\npose MAN, God gave these ''ideas'' their relative distinction or differentiation\nin thought. He then caused these thirty-five thoughts to vibrate to bring into\nformal manifestation the subtle astral body of nineteen \"ideas\" or powers and\nfinally the gross physical body of sixteen material elements. Before God actu-\nally created matter, or thought, or feeling, He created each of them as an\n७116७ ' in His mind, i.e., as differentiations in His consciousness. A rock is\na materialized thought in the cosmic dream created by God's consciousness;\nthe only difference between the rock and a flash of thought consists in the kinds\nof ideas that produced them. This is true also of human dreams, wherein we\nmay create a realistic rock or a realistic human being; their reality and ap-\nparent differentiation are merely ideas supplied by our own minds.\n\nEgoistic desire keeps the soul in the cage of thirty-five elemental ideas.\nAt physical death man's astral body and causal body enter the astral world.\nThose who have worked out all their ४ 2 karma, and who hold no desire to\nreturn to earth, go straightway back to God. Hence the saints tell us to con-\nquer desire, \"the great enemy, '' because desire is the chief cause of the soul's\nbondage in the three bodies.\n\nTHOUGHTS TO LIVE BY\n\nMan is given many chances to play both comedy and tragedy parts, being\ncast in each lifetime drama according to the wishes of the producer, karma\n(past actions). Then he goes out of that play forever, to be cast in the next\nlife in some new production. In spite of the fact that he reincarnates, each\nperson lives but once as a particular personality, because he does not recall\nhis previous lives.\n\n"}

Minerals, plants,\nand animal bodies-~-all are made of intelligence and electrons. Even the clod\nreflects intelligence, transforming itself into minerals in some places and in\nothers nurturing plants that support animals and human beings. The soil is\nalive. Plants too are alive; a tropical variety of Mimosa called sensitive plant\ncloses its leaves when you touch it.\n\nAccording to the theory of evolution, all forms of marine, animal, and\nbird life are interrelated. For instance, some fish that were hunted by larger\nand faster fish developed birdlike attributes and became flying fish. Other fish\ndeveloped lungs that can be used instead of gills when their native rivers dry up.\nThe tadpole starts out as a fish with gills and becomes a land animal with lungs.\nBut as yet there is no evidence of an ape's changing into aman. The idea of a\nmissing link between animals and man is erroneous. The earth's deepest\nstrata reveal first, seashells, then vegetation, animals, and finally different\nkinds of primeval man, Neanderthal, Rhodesian, Cro-Magnon, and modern man.\nWe do not find any half-man, half-animal skulls or bones in the strata where\nanimal skeletons are found, or in the strata where human skeletons are found.\n\nMAN-- Man is a special creation, although the human body is made\nA SPECIAL after the animal pattern. Human ears resemble seashells;\n| ~ and the tail, or coccyx, at the end of the human spine resem-\n\nbles that of primates. The Darwin point at the top of the ear\nis a vestige of the long ears of the donkey; our intestines resemble the snake.\nIn his quick movements, restless eyes, and grinning face, man resembles the\nmonkey. The running power of man is akin to the racing power of the horse.\nMan can be brave like the lion, crafty like the jackal, cruel like the tiger,\nmeek like the lamb, musical like the nightingale, ferocious like the wolf, and\n\nhypocritical like the cat that looks innocent after it has just eaten a tame canary.\n\nThe dispute between the evolutionist and the special creationist may be\nresolved by accepting an intermediate view: The scientist is right when he\n\n"}

But since no one has found any\nmissing link between animals and man, we should admit the possibility of man's\nbeing a special creation. One might then ask ''How is it that there are animal\ncharacteristics in man, if he is a special creation distinct from the animals ?\"\nThe answer is that for further advancement, the most highly evolved animal\n\nsouls were made to reincarnate in specially created human bodies.\n\nThe first human beings are referred to symbolically as Adam and Eve.\nGod created human bodies specially so that the newly created Adams and Eves\nmight use the power of will to materialize Cosmic Energy into the forms of\nhuman children, that is, immaculately create their own kind. God told them\nto enjoy all the other fruits of the garden of the senses--sight, smell, taste,\nand hearing--but not to indulge in the sense of touch. The transgression of\nAdam and Eve shows that they remembered their former incarnations in animal\nbodies, which are reproduced only by sexual creation, and were tempted. That\nis the reason Adam and Eve ignored the warning of God not to awaken the sex\ninstinct, the forbidden fruit on the spinal tree of life. Asa result, having\nchosen to create in the animal way rather than in the divine way God had intended\nfor them when He gave them human form, Adam and Eve and their descendants\nhad to go on creating their own kind by sexual creation rather than by immacu-\nlate conception.\n\n- MEMORY.

We do not\nPRE-EXISTENCE remember the nine months of our embryonic existence\n\nin this life, nor do we remember when we were six\nmonths old. It is all the less likely therefore that we would remember when we\nhad lived in a different body with a different brain and nervous system, anda\ndifferent appearance.\n\nIt is well that we do not remember our hard experiences in the school of\npast lives, for we might be discouraged at the prospect of having to struggle\nwith them again. We might even feel disinclined to be good again, imagining\ngood deeds to be of no value; or we might be bored by repetition.

We must eradicate our acquired egoistic imperfections by right living.\nTo re-establish our soul-perfection may require many lives. @\n\nThe tendencies that we exhibit up to the age of five come from our past\nlives. After that age they become diluted with newly acquired tendencies of this\nlife. Think back as far as you can remember, then enumerate your first unal-\nloyed tendencies. Did you feel attracted to incense, or Oriental furnishings,\nor pictures of saints? Or did you love mechanisms and mechanistic instruments?\nThose early tendencies, separated from the acquired tendencies of this life,\nreveal your past. Occidentals can develop Oriental characteristics in this life,\nand vice versa; and when they are reborn they can change their race and national-\nity.\n\nSometimes wise children are born of ordinary parents, and sometimes\nmoronic offspring come from intelligent parents. These seeming vagaries in\nlife show that souls of varying evolutional progress may be born in the same\nfamily. If the members of a family fight most of the time, it sometimes indi-\ncates that they knew each other in a previous life and were archenemies, con-\ncentrating on and establishing hatred for each other in their hearts. Therefore,\naccording to the laws of concentration and attraction involved in hatred, Nature\nbrought the fighting souls together again, so that at close quarters, within the\nsmall arena of the home, they could get enough of the long missed and eagerly\nwaited for opportunity to indulge in the joy of fighting with one another. So\nbeware! Do not bring your enemy near you, nor attract his bad qualities by con-\nstantly concentrating upon him through the channel of hatred.\n\nBE FREE FROM God sent perfect souls forth to behave like immortals--\nDESIRES AND calm, desireless, and happy--while watching and\nATTACHMENTS acting in the moving pictures of earth life. But, through\n\nproximity and ignorant behavior while performing in and\nwatching the intricate dramas of earthly life, souls develop egoistic attachments\nto other actors and to certain scenes and conditions in the mundane moving pic-\ntures. Unless these desires are cast off before death, the soul must return to\nanother body in the same earthly moving picture house in order to work out the\ndesires born there. For instance, if you die with the desire to possess an expen-\nlana automobile, you won't remain in heaven, or the astral spheres, where souls\nglide about without vehicles; you will have to come back to earth where that par-\nticular desire can be fulfilled. Even the highest types of earthly desires are\nlimited when compared to the soul's true desire, to inherit the eternal kingdom\nof the cosmos.\n\nActions performed to please God create no karmic bonds of attachment. For\ninstance, if you eat strawberry shortcake or make money to please God, or with\nthe consciousness of pleasing God, you will not carry the desire with you when\nyou die; but if you act with greed or thought of gain for self, and then suddenly\n\n"}

They must remain in certain parts of the\nastral universe; the locality is determined by the karmic law of cause and effect\nwhich governs the outcome of all human actions. According to their different\nqualities, physically disembodied souls consciously or unconsciously form\nvarious clans, and remain together in their respective quarters in space.\n\nYogis who learn in their earth-life how to remain conscious during the state\nof sleep, and who can stop the breath at will and still remain conscious, may\nthen go out of the body consciously, and remain conscious, even in the final\nsleep of death. Souls that have lived virtuously on earth have the privilege of\n| अ. their vibratory residence in the astral world whenever they desire to\nreincarnate on the physical plane; reincarnation is not forced upon them. Peo-\nple with deep realization may thus come and go from earth as they wish.\n\nDuring our earthly sojourn we bestow our love mostly on members of our\nfamily. We grow attached to them, and then suddenly they are torn from us by\ndeath. It makes us feel like rebels. Why is it that beings come into our lives\nand then are taken away? What is the reason? If anyone wrests our material\npossessions from ८8, we fight, we bring lawsuits against him; but we can only\nweep helplessly when the dearest of all our possessions, our loved ones, are\nsuddenly and apparently unreasonably taken away fromus. We suffer silently\nand then, after a time, we more or less forget, and accept the decree of des-\ntiny.\n\n"}

Is Nature a jester\nthat takes pleasure in seeing lovers separated, and that mocks at man's sacred\nvows of loyal love and friendship? Is parental love merely instinct-instigated?\nIs conjugal love only nature-and-sex instigated? Is friendship born only of\npassing emotions? Is the dream of eternal love between souls a mockery of\nimagination?\n\nIs it through a vagrant whim of Nature that some souls are thrown together\nso that they become attached to one another? Or is it because of similar actions\nof previous lives, similar dispositions, like tendencies? Is it prenatal acquaint-\nance, friendship, and love that bring souls together? Has God made of us intel-\nligent puppets to play out His life-dramas, only to be destroyed in the end at His\nwill? Has He made some of us poor, some of us rich, some idiotic or wise,\nmerely to fill His stage of life with variety, pulling us back at death into His\nbosom? Is this life the beginning and the end?

When friendship\nand love between souls becomes corroded with poisonous chemicals of posses-\nsiveness, selfishness, mechanical family relationships, sex obsessions, physi-\ncal = emotional excitement, utilitarian barterings, sudden attach-\nments followed by sudden hates--then human love dies.\n\nBut hidden in each man's heart is an eternal divine love. It may remain\nasleep for awhile, but it can never really die. If man's human love fails to\nbecome purified by his association with other people, he will be dissatisfied and\nwill keep on seeking other loves in this life (or beyond the portals of this life in\nan astral incarnation) until he meets someone (usually his guru) in whom he\nfinds the full expression of all the perfections of divine love.\n\nThe highest form of earthly love is friendship, for in friendship there is no\ncompulsion.

When perfect\npure love and friendship are expressed between two\n\nsouls, that love will be registered in heaven as one divine love; that love will\n\nbe a commingled fount of love ever playing in the bosom of God. Divine love\n\ndefies mortal destiny, and laughs at the impotency of time and death.\n\nSouls who are seeking the joy of divine love mutually shared will never be\nsatisfied with substitute-pleasures of physical attachment, \"eye attraction,\" or\nsex lure. These may pacify man for the moment, but the thrill is soon over.\nTrue human love can be satisfied only when it has expanded itself into unselfish,\nunconditional, divine love.\n\nWhen you feel that you can be a friend to another person unconditionally;\nwhen you feel that all your most exacting demands for perfect and pure divine\nlove have been amply expressed through this person; and when you lose all\ndesire to seek human love in anyone else, then will the friendship-thirst of your\nsoul be quenched.\n\nHuman love may find a perfect divine answer to its seeking in a pure friend- | ।\nship with someone of the same sex; or it may behold the divine love in pure con-\njugal friendship with someone of the opposite sex. In the latter case, human love\ncan perfect itself only if there is a predominance of soul affinity and a subordina-\ntion of physical attraction. It is possible for human love to find divine satis-\nfaction in all types of human relationships: in that of parent or son or servant,\nor--and this is the highest relationship--that of guru and disciple. The guru or\nspiritual preceptor expresses the highest ideal of love and friendship: he wants\nnothing but the disciple's good; and leads him, through incarnations if need be,\nto the ultimate good or God.\n\nKEEP ON Until you are able to express divine love, Nature will continue to\nLs mock at your friendships through the instrumentality of moods,\n\nfickleness, temperament, emotion, sudden parting, and death.\nYou should keep on seeking, in this life and throughout incarnations if neces-\nsary, until you find in some pure heart the perfect divine love of God.

''My feet are purified walk-\ning for Thee; my voice is sanctified talking of Thee; my feelings are pure, feel-\ning Thee. Work Thou through my hands and my feet, through my eyes, my\nbrain, and my speech.\"\n\nCalmness is the throne of God. The yogi meditates day and night so that he\ndoes not lose that power. As often as he has a moment for reflection, he brings\nback that power of calmness and manifests it. My Master said: ''There are\nwilling instruments and unwilling instruments. God works through willing\ninstruments.\"\n\nWhen a man ''drinks'! God, endless thrills of intoxication are with him. A\nsilent, burning devotion comes to him. The yogi prays silently until God answers.\nWe should pray when others are asleep: ''Father, answer my heartburning pray-\ners. Iam no longer satisfied with playthings, Father, I want Thee. Iwill wake\nall creation with my cries. Come, I want Thee. 1 want playthings no more!\"\nDevotion is the love we express to God. Devotion should have no taint of fear.\n\nIt is to man's own interest that he should show devotion to God silently, devo-\ntion of the heart, burning devotion. We have to surrender ourselves to Him\nand pray until He answers us. No one can destroy the charm of divine love.\n\n"}

It is not the end of things, but a transfer from physical experiences in\nthe gross domain of changeable matter to purer joys in the astral realm of\nmulticolored lights.\n\nMen whose causal and astral bodies are tainted with seeds of evil karma\n(past actions) and with obnoxious desires become extremely afraid at the call\nof death and struggle very hard to be deaf to it. They want to stay in the apart-\nment house of flesh even when their bodily lease has expired. But the law of\nchange, or death, evicts them by force.

When you go to the astral world, earthly life becomes un-\nreal to you, and astral life seems real; and when you come back to earthly life,\nastral life becomes unreal to you and earthly life seems real. But you must\nknow that both of these experiences are nothing more than the dreams of God.\nSome day, when you find Him, you will awaken from all these dreams of \"life\"\nand ''death.\"'\n\n““Man's idéas of Utopia come from his experiences in the astral land. But\neven when you arrive in the heavenly astral kingdom you will not be completely\nsatisfied. You have to free yourself from all delusions, whether of the physi-\ncal world or the astral world, before you can realize yourself as eternally\nblissful Spirit.\n\nREACH ADVANCED The contacting of astral beings is possible both by the\nBEINGS power of passivity and by the power of concentration.\nTHROUGH LOVE A spiritualistic medium can invoke the presence of\nastral beings while in a certain trance state, but this\npractice is dangerous.

How? The spiritual eye is the instrument. It is the radio by\nwhich you broadcast, and it is the receiving set by which you may tune in with\nthe other world.

It is also possible\n\nto ''tune in'' with loved ones who have died and who have been reborn on earth.\nIn dreams you can't communicate any message to them, although they may\ntalk to you. But in the superconscious state you can know how to locate them\nand also how to talk with them. This is what happens: the heart sends out\ncertain vibrations; and certain responsive electrical impulses come into the\nbrain. Then during deep concentration, when all other thoughts have subsided,\nthe desired image appears. What you want to learn is how to tune in with\nsuperconsciousness.\n\nUnless you have love for a person, you cannot find him. And if you are\nsad and grieve for a person who is dead, you may keep him earthbound. That\nattitude is selfish. You cry for yourself because of your own loss. You can\nhelp him much more if you send just your love. Broadcast loving thoughts;\nsuch thoughts travel through the ether and are received by departed souls.\nWhen you send an intelligently directed thought through the ether, if the thought\nis continuous it will finally reach the desired person, even if you do not know\nwhere he is.\n\n॥\n\nIf you lose through death someone very dear to you, and if you find it im-\npossible to forget him, even after the passage of many years, then you may\nproceed to find him in the following way: (Practice it for two hours each day,\nfor months, or, if necessary for years.) Sitting ona straight chair, practice\nfor one hour the highest technique of concentration you know (Kriya or Hong-\nSau or Om); then lift your hands and concentrate upon the fingertips. Then\nconcentrate upon the point between the eyebrows, see the spiritual eye, and\ncontinuously will to contact the astral body of the departed soul. Keep on turn-\ning your hands very gently in a circle toward north, south, east, and west.\n\nAt every direction in the circle around which your hand moves, try to feel the\npresence of the astral body of the departed soul.\n\nWhen your fingers feel that you have touched him, as you used to touch\nhim when he lived on earth, your heart will be thrilled. Keep on visualizing\nhim in the spiritual eye and you will see him. Instruct your fingers and heart\nto indicate in what place your friend has been reborn, according to the direc-\ntion you had felt him through your fingers. When you feel him through your\nfingers and heart, and can see him and talk with him, he will tell you where\nhe is in the astral world, or in whatever place he has been reborn. Then\nthere will be great rejoicing!\n\nYou must not feel helpless before the fact of death; you must not accept\nthe decree of fate and begin to forget your true, perfect friend. Throughout\nyour life broadcast to him your undying love, until you succeed in seeing his\nor her astral body, or until he or she appears to you in the conventional garb\nof a human body.\n\nIf you had a perfect friend who met a so-called untimely death, make the\n\n"}

You have done\nmuch work on it. God made all men in His image, and some faces do reflect\ngodliness; but other men have desecrated that image of God by wrong thoughts\nand actions, and their faces reflect evil and cruelty. Your physical appear-\nance mirrors your actions of this life and of past lives.\n\nWhat you have sown, you must reap now or in the future. It is not God who\npunishes you or rewards you. You are your own judge. You punish yourself\nthrough evil thoughts and actions, or free yourself through good ones. Your\nonly escape from karmic law is to realize the Self within.\n\nKarma is the law of action. Mind or body in a specific form of movement\nis termed ''action.'' Every action mentally or physically performed, conscious-\nly or unconsciously, has a specific effect on the life of man. These good and\nbad effects of actions in this present life remain in the subconsciousness, and\nthose seed effects brought over from past existences are hidden in the supercon-\nsciousness. The seed effects of actions--good or bad--are stored in the sub-\nconsciousness or superconsciousness until one develops spiritually to the point\nwhere his actions are no longer identified with feeling or personal attachment.\nThe ideal is not total inaction or inertia; rather, to cognize experiences with-\nout desire for the fruit (outcome) of action. Action is necessary to life on this\nplane, but it should be performed with unselfish ambition if one is to avoid\nimprisoning karmic chains.\n\nAction that is performed in this life by free will and intelligence is called\nfree action, or Purushakar; actions performed under the influence of habits\nestablished by actions in past lives are called Samskar. Purushakar means\naction performed by free will. Samskar means action performed by influence.\nActions that come under the classification of Samskar are those past habits,\nor actions of past lives, which come as the instincts and habits of this life.\nThis inner environment governs your life. There is also an outer environ-\nment--the planets, world, nation, family, neighborhood, books, and so forth.\nThese all influence man's actions.\n\nTo be able to do anything one pleases is not the real meaning of freedom\nof action.

To be good just because it has become a\n| । habit to be good is not freedom.

To be good, not just from habit, but because\nyou think you should be good, and because you have the will power to be good--\nthat is real freedom.\n\nTHE LAW OF ACTION The law of karma, or action, is scientific, being\n\nIS BASED UPON THE rooted in the law of causation; it has also a philo-\nLAW OF CAUSE sophic, moral, and practical side.

To be liberated from the clutch of karma by understanding it.\nKnowledge is freedom.\n\n2. To be able to act rightly, free from external influence and desire;\n| । ~ ~ ~ था ~~ -and thus to be able consciously and independently to create ` `\ngood karma, in accordance with right judgment.\n\n3.

Roast karmic seeds of past actions in the fire\nof desireless action and deep Kriya Yoga\nmeditation.\n\n4. Diagnose all paradoxical events of karma.\n5. Control so-called fate.\nKARMA IS NOT FATALISM\n\nThe law of action, or karma, is not fatalism. The effects of whatever you\nhave done may be changed. Many people confuse karma with what they call\nfate. The effect of an action for which a person is responsible may not come\nto him until a long time afterward, when he has forgotten about the action. Not\nbeing able to account for the effect because he has forgotten its cause, he\ndecides that he must be a victim of fate.\n\nThe idea of fate springs from ignorance of the real causes that operate to\nproduce a particular event. The seed-effects of our actions do not always\n1:41 sprout; and if we happen to think of the possible consequences, we\nquickly forget if the results are not immediately forthcoming. But the seed\neffects born of those actions remain hidden, ready to germinate into the seem-\ningly sudden and unexpected events of life. Then we mistakenly think them to\nbe caused by an external fate. But there really is no such force as fate. Our\nlives are governed by our past actions.\n\nDifferent habits are controlling our different lives. Everything we are now,\nand everything that is happening to us now, comes from the past. This lesson\nis given to show you that you should not be a fatalist, going through life feeling\nbeaten and thinking that everything disagreeable that happens to you is caused\nby an unjust fate. Nothing rules you. You are the architect of your destiny.\n\n"}

Because he has transgressed divine laws\nin this or in a past life.\n\nThe karmic law--that you reap in this life what you sowed in past lives--\nis a just law. We should not impute to God the stigma of being an autocrat who\ncreates some people with healthy brains and some people with defective minds\njust for variety. The karmic law explains the seeming injustices that occur\nfrom the very birth of human life.

The\ndoctrine of karma alone gives faith in the justice and wisdom of God's laws\nworking in the lives of man.\n\nIf a person lives for one hundred years, he has time to use his God-given\nreason and free choice to struggle against evil and become good; but a child\nwho dies at the age of five has no time to exercise his powers to win the battle\nof life.

If the tendency toward suc-\ncess in a past life was weak, and efforts to attain success in this life are weak,\nthen success in this life will be meager, almost negligible. But if the success\ntendency of a past life was strong and the present life is marked by inactivity\nand inertia, one may be successful, but only by indirect means, such as being\nborn in a rich family or suddenly inheriting a fortune. Persons who grew tired\nof accumulating riches in a past life might be reborn in poverty because of the\nrepulsion against money developed before death. They might have to struggle,\nbut usually they come into large sums of money by a so-called ''stroke of good\nluck'' or through a sudden inheritance or lucky small investments.\n\nNo one can be exclusively either a financial success or a failure in all @\nlives, for human consciousness changes by its own weakness or strength or\nthrough the influence of changes of environment. Real financial success in all\nlives--until emancipation frees one from such considerations--consists in the\nability to destroy all the apparent tendencies of failure by the power of super-\nconcentration. A yogi may not possess much material substance, but through\nhis ability to focus his mind he learns to create at will that which he needs.\n\nOf course, advanced yogis do not entertain any personal desire. They live only\nthat God's love may reign on the shrine of their souls forever and that the\nHeavenly Father may help them to kindle His love on the flaming heart-altars\nof others.\n\nSEEDS OF PROSPERITY Blind selfishness is the root cause of unbalancing\nAND ADVERSITY the prosperity vibration. Rich people who have\n\nfought failure and acquired success, but who later\nbecome selfish--ignoring the agonies of others who fail--may lose their wealth\nby wrong investments, or may attract poverty in the next life. Many are the\nromances of Dame Fortune with her consort, Lord Karma (the law of cause\nand effect).\n\nA person who is not prosperous may feel that he must have been a failure\nfor many lives.

By the repeated efforts and knockings of his will\npower, ultimately he will surely rouse the success tendencies sleeping ina\ndark chamber of subconsciousness.\n\nMost people start out to adopt a career or profession without considering\nthe influence of prenatal karmic habits. That is why born artists fail when they\nattempt to act the role of businessmen without training or experience. That is\nwhy the born spiritual man does not usually succeed as a businessman. A man\ncannot be an absolute failure unless he hypnotized himself into thinking so; a\nman is an absolute failure only when neither his judgment nor the judgment of\nothers can convince him that he can be a success.\n\nHEALTH TYPES There are different degrees of health, just as there are\nCLASSIFIED different degrees of illness and many kinds of diseases\nAND EXPLAINED to produce them. Some people are so healthy and shin-\ning that they seem to be proof against any disease. I\ncall them the 'asbestos'' clan. There are others whose health is like a fine\nwatch that goes well when properly cared for, but ''runs'\"' erratically at the\nslightest neglect. They might be called the ''mechanical' type. Some people\n\n‘keep on existing in spite of frequent hailstorms of disease, with only occasion-\n\nal periods of health. Icall them the \"die-hard\" type. Some are sick all the\ntime. Some are healthy most of the time, but when they do get sick, they are\nvery sick. They are the \"born healthy'' type. Some are healthy but weak.\nThey are the ''medium healthy\" type. Let us trace the past karma of each of\nthese types--their prenatal habits-- and their postnatal results.\n\n1. The \"asbestos\" type is born of the accumulated good health habits\nof many lives (including the last incarnation), plus natural health\nhabits and regular exercise in this life. This type of person was\nprobably a yogi in many lives and he can destroy all past seeds of\nill-health if, in this life, he practices yoga principles (scientific\nunion of body, mind, and soul with God by the scientific psycholog-\nical methods of meditation and discipline). If he merely concen-\ntrates on physical exercise and proper diet, but does not practice\nspiritual yoga principles. he may retain his health, but runs a chance\nof losing it late in life. The person who properly practices yogic con-\ncentration (as you have been taught in previous lessons) overcomes\nlittle health transgressions and any accumulated seed tendencies of\nunhealthful habits acquired in this life. An aspirant for the ''asbestos'\"'\ntype of health cannot depend only upon past health tendencies and\nphysical exercises in this life; he must also keep burning away the\naccumulating seeds of unhealthy actions of this life, no matter how\nsmall they may be.\n\n"}

The \"born healthy\" type lives on his accumulated past health seed-\ntendencies, plus fairly good health habits and exercises, but per-\nforms no yoga practices. He becomes ill when the store of acquired\nhealth has been used up, and the little unroasted seeds of tendencies\nof health transgressions in this life grow strong.\n\n3.  ''Medium healthy\" is the state of those whose past seed-tendencies of\nhealth were acquired solely by will power, and not by the power of\nmind plus physical exercise. That is why this type is born healthy\nbut weak. Physical exercise in this life would remove that weakness.\n\n4. The \"mechanical\" health type is the result of past obedience to health\nlaws only through fear and nervous caution. That is why this type has\nhealth only as long as he follows rules. Too much dependence upon\nphysical laws and not enough upon God, plus a lack of self-reliance,\nmakes one become \"health-law-bound.'' Do not be a slave to law; use\nthe law to serve you.\n\n5. The \"die-hard\" type is born when sickness and health tendencies have\nequal power. That is why he has health and sickness alternately. If\nyou have great devotion and are obedient to God, you will have a\ngreater chance of response from God than if you have great devotion\nbut continually break God's hygienic, mental, and spiritual laws.\n\nDESTROYING SEEDS To destroy sprouted chronic disease seeds and other\nOF DISEASE lurking disease seeds, the exercises for recharging\nAND FAILURE the body battery, given in the first Step of the lessons,\n\nshould be practiced with deep concentration, and\nfollowed by practice of the concentration and meditation lessons. When practic-\ning these lessons, the consciousness of health, energy, and power must be kept\npredominant. When this power is felt all over the body as an incessant influx\nof vitality, then that vital ray should be switched to the brain and held there for\na long time. In this way the vital power will roast all lurking disease seed-\ntendencies from the past.\n\nDuring meditation, the yogi feels the power of concentration in between the\neyebrows, and peace all over his body. Whenever he especially wants to rid\nthe brain cells of past failure or sickness seeds, he must switch that raylike\npeace and concentration power into the brain. The peace ordinarily felt in the\nentire body, and the power of concentration in between the eyebrows, must be\ncontinuously transferred to and felt in the brain. |\n\nThe same method may be used to burn seeds of failure. Every business-\nman should know that good fortune is dependent upon the law of successful\nactions of the past plus continued successful activities in this life. A man\nstriving for permanent success should meditate every morning and night, and\nwhen the superconscious peace and concentration rays burst forth and the\n\n"}

Liberated masters carry\nhalos of invisible healing light.

He has given\nus free will: the power to punish or reward ourselves by the use or misuse of\nour own reason and will. As man transgresses the laws of health, prosperity,\nor wisdom, he punishes himself accordingly with ill-health, poverty, or igno-\nrance.\n\nThrough the law of cause and effect that governs human actions, we order\nourselves to be punished or rewarded. Man should parole himself from the\nprison of his own past undesirable habits. Since man is the judge, no jail of\nsuffering, poverty, or ignorance can hold him if he wants to liberate himself.\nIt is up to him to speak the words: ''Be thou free,'' and to make the jailer of\nhis wrong convictions obey his command.\n\nIK\n\n"}

These cellular molecules are made of whirling atoms, protons,\nand electrons, which in turn are made from electroprotonic energy--the basic\nsubstance of creation--composed of semi-intelligent sparks of God's conscious-\nness.\n\nHOW LIVING CELLS A chemical force knots various cells together in\nARE REJUVENATED mysterious ways to form the different kinds of cere-\n\nbral, nervous, connective, osseous, and muscular\ntissues, and organs. That same invisible force biologically arranges the cells\nso that some form into hard bones, wonderfully worked into a skeletal frame,\nto which the flesh clings. The body as a solid substance occupies a very small\nspace, but since the body is essentially made of condensed Cosmic Conscious-\nness, it is potentially vast and omnipresent. ,\n\nBodily motions are constantly flooded and rejuvenated from the inner soul\nsource by the different motions of consciousness: subconsciousness, con-\nsciousness, superconsciousness, Christ Consciousness, and Cosmic Con-\nsciousness. On the external or material side the body is reinforced with a\nconstant flow of chemicals, oxygen, and sunshine. It is a strange phenome-\nnon of maya that the chemical motions of the body have to be kept active by\nthese material forces when it would be possible to keep them alive and charged\nwith vitality entirely from the inner source of Cosmic Consciousness. The\nbody, being motion, cannot live without motion. It has to be kept dancing with\nlife by forces derived from external sources~-food and sunshine; and by vital-\nity derived from the internal source--Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nThe nature of matter is change. The nature of Spirit is changelessness.\nThe body is born. It progressively changes through growth from babyhood to\nadulthood to old age. Then it degenerates and dies. During all this time the\ntissues are passing through continual phases of cell growth and decay. The\ncells of the body are constantly decaying. This does not mean disintegration\nof the body. 'Decay'' merely means certain variations of motion that human\nbeings fear and dislike. Yet we like the changing, dancing waves of vitality\ncalled \"youth. \"'\n\n"}

Usually the soul uses the\nprocesses of reincarnation to gather anew the necessary vibrations of energy\nand chemicals and to transform them into a new body. However, an evolved\nsoul sometimes rejuvenates a worn-out body by changing its atomic vibrations\nthus halting the natural tendencies of the flesh toward dissolution. The all-\npowerful soul of a spiritually evolved man can even remodel an old body, in-\nstead of discarding it entirely, by reweaving the garment of flesh into the de-\nsired form with strong electro-vitalic threads. Only the masters can do this,\nand only a few of those who have such power choose to use it.

I crave your pardon, my Almighty Friend. Forgive me for my ig-\nnorant blasphemies against Thee.\" Then he inquired of the saint: \"Will\nyou satisfy my curiosity as to why all good things were attracted to Mr.\nSham, and why even on that Friday he found three million dollars?\"\n\n“Well, my son,\" the saint replied, “Mr. Sham was not wicked in his\npast life; indeed, he was a tolerably virtuous man, But in time he\nbecame tired of a life of restraint, and he thought: ‘’What’s the use of\nstupidly being virtuous?’ Then he made up his mind to live according to\nthe dictates of his evil impulses. And just about the time that he made\nup his mind to live as he pleased, he died. Mr. Sham was born a sinner\nin this life because of this resolution before death in his last life;\nbut because of his soul virtue in his last incarnation, he automatically\nreaped the results of his past good actions. Thus he attracted to him-\nself a good wife, friends, fortune, and health. Now, however, the bal-\nance is tipped: the weight of his sins in this life has become greater\nthan that of his virtue of the past incarnation. On that Friday he\nreceived the last big payment of his accrued good karma, in the form of\nthree million dollars. It is nothing compared to the imperishable vir-\ntue you have acquired in this life by constant hard labor after God. Go\nback and you will find that your friend Mr. Sham is a victim of untold\nmiseries now pouring on him from all directions.\" Saying this, the\nsaint suddenly vanished.\n\n"}

Later on he met a wonderfully sweet and spiritual\nwoman, whom he married. His ill health disappeared as if it had never\nexisted, and a rich aunt changed her will a few hours before her death\nto leave him her ten-million-dollar estate.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Sham found himself suddenly stricken with\nparalysis, and lay helpless. Shortly after this, his good wife died.\nAccording to custom in India, Mr. Sham had buried all of his money ina\nsecret chamber beneath the floor under his bed. A disgruntled servant\ngot scent of it. One day, in collusion with a few robbers, the servant\nmasked himself and entered his master’s room. While Mr. Sham lay help-\nless, the servant made off with all the money. After that, Mr. Sham had\nto live on the charity of his friend, Mr. Honest, which he did for the\nrest of his life.\n\nThis story helps to explain the paradoxical happenings of life: why\nsome people are born healthy, intelligent, and wealthy, and from the\nvery beginning of their lives do not have to struggle for an existence;\nand why some others--good, spiritual, and intelligent-~are born in pov-\nerty, ill health, and trouble. All our misfortunes or fortunes are due,\nnot to luck, but to definite actions consciously performed at some time\nin the past. `\n\nTherefore, no matter how fortunate and good one may be, he should\nnot become inactive in the performance of good or, like Mr. Sham, active\nin the performance of evil, lest he use up all the fruits of past good\nactions and be left impoverished and miserable. The wise man increases\nin virtue until he attains that perfection from which there can be no\nfall. Even a sinner who apparently \"gets away with 10,\" should not be\ntoo sure. He should stop all evil actions lest the counteracting fru-\nition of good actions of the past be spent and the fruits of his erring\nactions of the present ripen into utter misery, as in the case of Mr.\nSham. Man should ever desist from evil ways and steadily reinforce with\ncontinued good deeds the virtuous actions of the past.\n\nEven a virtuous man who continuously suffers from all kinds of\ndifficulties should not be discouraged from remaining virtuous; for if\nhe continues to be good, he will one day find that the counteracting\ninfluence of his virtuous actions has obliterated the karmic power of\npast evil actions. He who keeps on being virtuous, even when sorely\ntried in every way, eventually finds that the balance turns; then good\nfortune seeks him in everything, as it did Mr. Honest.\n\nNo one should imagine that he can escape the effects of evil ac-\ntions; nor that virtuous actions are fruitless. It is inevitable that\nevil actions bring evil, or suffering; and that good actions bring good,\nor happiness.\n\nkkk\n\n"}

They live mechanically,\nwithout any aim or goal, and leave the shores of this world unconsciously when\nlife is done. We are not meant to live thus, like automatons. We must find\nthe purpose of life. :\n\nBoth the great man and the small man have to struggle just to exist. Most\npeople excuse themselves from a search for.the eternal verities, saying, 'How\ncan we adjust our actions to an ideal? We do not know how.'' But you do know\nthat you must eat and that you must think in order to live; therefore you should\nfind peace first in fulfilling your material and intellectual needs. We can build\nthe temple of our prosperity by analyzing our existing needs and learning how\nto fulfill them in a divine way. By analysis we can see that the nature of every\nhuman being is threefold: physical, mental, and spiritual. Life is often spent\nin supplying the needs of the physical being only. However, man's true pros-\nperity lies in supplying the needs of his mental and spiritual beings as well.\n\nKnowing how to become prosperous is always important and the word\n\"prosperity'' plays an important part in our consciousness. We should know\ntherefore in what lies our real prosperity, and the surest way of attaining it.\n\nReal prosperity means supreme happiness, mental efficiency, and some\nmaterial advantages. Real prosperity comes by increasing the power of your\nmental efficiency, by which you can create at will the things you need. There\nis a difference between things that you need and things that you want. Your\nneeds are those things which are absolutely necessary in life. What you want\nis usually something you can get along without, but desire causes you to think\nyou must possess it to be happy. Most people spend their entire lives in try-\ning to acquire so-called ''necessities.'' The wise person always concentrates\n\n"}

Seeing what others have does\nnot cause him to feel that he must have the same.\n\nTrue success is another expression for all-round prosperity. Those who\nhave perfect health, prosperity, happiness, wisdom, and understanding have\ntrue success. If you know how to withdraw your attention and energy from all\nobjects of distraction and place them upon one object of concentration, then\nyou know how to create at will what you need.\n\nWHAT IS All of us want prosperity, but do we all find it? No. Itisa\nPROSPERITY? will-o'-the-wisp that is always hiding from us. Most people\n\nhave a limited concept of the meaning of the word. Some\nwill say: 'Well, prosperity means health.'' But health without money to satis-\nfy your hunger is not prosperity. Someone else will say it means great wealth.\nBut if you have great wealth and great pain from chronic indigestion, that is\n=| prosperity either. When you are able to adjust yourself perfectly to the\nworld, then you may be called ''prosperous.\"' But beyond that a thoughtful per-\nson wonders about the origin of reason and the other faculties peculiar to man.\nUnless we find the answers to all our questions, we are not really prosperous.\nWhen you no longer doubt, but know the spiritual answer to every question\nabout life; when you can find the answers to every problem within yourself,\nthen you are prosperous.\n\n15 MONEY Most people think that you are prosperous only when you\n\n\"PROSPERITY''? have lots of money, but real success means that you have\n\nthe power to create all things--whatever is necessary for\nyour entire existence--at your command. In what lies real necessity? We\nshould analyze the real meaning of ''needs. '' If the need is boiled down to cer-\ntain definite things, then the need can be easily satisfied.\n\nMoney is not in itself either a blessing or a curse. It is the manner in\nwhich we use money that determines its effect. Take a dollar bill and ask it\n\"Shall I buy poison with you?'' The inanimate dollar doesn't answer. But\nmisuse it and it will punish you. When you use money rightly it gives you hap-\npiness. Even a saint uses money in his work. Whoever eats has to pay for\nthe food; it is better to be able to buy food than to have to live on charity.\nEverything of value has its price.\n\nMost people spend their entire mental energy in trying to make money,\nand some succeed in this only to die of heart failure just when they are about\nto secure happiness. If you have splendid health and ample wealth and plenty\nof trouble with others and with yourself, you really have very little success or\nprosperity. Life becomes futile and without purpose when you can't find hap-\npiness. When wealth is lost, you have lost little; when health is lost, you have\nlost something; but when inner peace is lost, all is lost\n\nYou should increase the strength of your body and then increase the power\nof your mind. The best way to increase mental power is to try to accomplish\n\n"}

Strive first for communion with God. If you have faith\nthat prosperity is controlled by God, not man, you will see that His power is\nworking with you. In wanting us to depend on Him alone, God does not mean\nthat you should not think for yourself; He wants you to use your initiative.

Only those who do not understand that there is\na law of cause and effect believe in chance or fate. The sunlight shines equal-\nly upon the charcoal and upon the diamond.

From the human\npoint of view of time He is, was, and ever shall be Joy. In Spirit there is no\npast or future tense--only the present--because Spirit Consciousness, unlike\nthat of man, is not interrupted by death and oblivion. Spirit is ever conscious.\nDivine Superconsciousness never ceases to operate actively, as the conscious-\nness of man does in sleep. Spirit has no alternating consciousness of wakeful-\nness and subconsciousness like that of man, but has perpetual, enjoyable,\nactive and inactive wakefulness combined within Itself.\n\nSpirit has always existed as ecstatic Bliss. But there was no one else to\nenjoy His blissful Being, so He separated Himself into three aspects: the\nknower, the act of knowing, and the thing known--the enjoyer, the process of\nenjoying, and the thing enjoyed. This triune division was accomplished by the\nlaw of relativity, or the cosmic delusion. Spirit, being one and indivisible,\nhad to wilfully and willingly imagine Himself to be many. Spirit being inde-\npendent and Self-contained, everything that evolves out of Him has His quali-\nties of independence and Self-sufficiency. The apparent desire of Spirit to\ncreate Himself as many was not real desire because its fulfillment was not\nnecessary to Him. If creation were a necessity to Spirit, then He would be im-\nperfect. In differentiating Himself as the knower, the knowing, and the known\nHe merely wanted to appreciate His own almighty Bliss-consciousness through\nHim self as many individual consciousnesses. The many were to discover that\nBliss by individual, independent effort. Spirit only differentiated Himself in\nthis way for a cosmic entertainment.\n\nSPIRIT AS KNOWER, Spirit has one consciousness, that of Bliss. But as\nKNOWING, AND KNOWN individual souls encased in bodies, Spirit beholds\n\nsolids, liquids, gases, energy, feeling, and thought\nas relatively different things. This is illusion; for solids, liquids, gases, and\nfeelings are nothing but different forms of consciousness. All these can be\nduplicated and perceived ina dream. Spirit's imaginative power to dream is\ninfinite. Anything coming out of Spirit has the essential qualities of Spirit,\nhence Cosmic Delusion, or Satan, is the conscious imagination of Spirit willing @\nto make Himself look finite, whereas in reality He is infinite. This desireless\ndesire, this infinite cosmic dream of finitude does not affect Spirit; but it affects\n"}

To Spirit that which\nappears to us as death is nothing more than one aspect of the eternal Cosmic\nPlay.\n\nSatan, the conscious force of delusion that makes the Infinite look finite,\nreceived independence to go on constantly transforming the Infinite into the\nfinite. The satanic force was unable, however, to keep in finite forms the\ncreatures God had created. Satan then tried to perpetuate the various species\nby the law of sex propagation. Defect and misery arose from this. All things\nand creatures began to suffer. Animate and inanimate creatures, instead of\nrealizing themselves to be living waves of the cosmic sea of life, unchangeable\nand essentially immortal, were made to believe, by the cosmic law of satanic\ndelusion, that they were isolated, separated from the cosmic dream of life,\nhaving origin and decay. Individual souls were further deluded into feeling\n| to their passing states of existence. Such attachment is born of igno-\nrance, the evil which is the real cause of all suffering, hence suffering born\nof ignorant attachment is also an evil.\n\nHYPNOTIC SPELL Finite beings, instead of observing with the all-seeing\nOF SATAN, OR eyes of the Infinite the superficial and formal changes\nDELUSION they undergo, began to behold these transitional states\n\nthrough the deceiving eyes of cosmic delusion, or Satan.\n\n| if all finite things acted in tune with the Infinite, they would not experience... |\n\nfear, disease, or death in the ordinary mortal way; but only as illusions being\nsuggested to them, as during a hypnotic trance. An outsider cannot make a\nperson under hypnosis believe that he is not seeing or feeling something that\nhas been suggested to him to see or feel. A dreaming man does not know that\nhe is dreaming. So it is that persons under the hypnotic spell of Satan, or de-\nlusion, do not know that all evil--disease, inharmony, wars--are merely illu-\nsions created by cosmic delusion and the misleading imagination born of that\ndelusion.\n\nWhy is the tiger the enemy of man, and vice versa? Why does the cat eat\nmice, and the big fish devour smaller, helpless fish? Why is it that the mos-\nquito is not satisfied with just drinking human blood but also injects poison in-\nto it? Why are there earthquakes and sudden accidents? Why do sudden fam-\nines and epidemics visit man? Why is it that destructive forces lie side by\nside with the harmonious divisions of seasons, night and day, health, sunshine\nand fresh air, human reason? It seems that if God is goodness, or harmony,\nand all things are created by Him, then we must ask: how can inharmony,\nsuffering, or evil exist? Certainly man did not create all evil.\n\nINORGANIC SUBSTANCES The conscious cosmic delusion, or the desire-\nCONSTANTLY CHANGING less desire of Spirit, empowered by the Infinite\n\nto create finite things independently, through\n\n| । its divinely bestowed imagination, began to pull everything away from the In-\n\nfinite. Thus the law of repulsion was evolved, and through this the process of\n\n"}

The\nlaw of sex creation in man and of any kind of physical reproduction is the effort\nof the cosmic delusion or Satan to preserve the kingdom of inharmonious fini-\ntude. Tempting all creatures to remain on the plane of sex creation, Satan\nfights the divine law of evolution through reincarnation, by which souls evolve\ninto higher and higher forms until they go back to Spirit.\n\nIn spite of the cosmic satanic power's influencing everything to remain in\nfinite forms, the Infinite Power is ever calling everything back to merge into\nHim by the law of evolution and reincarnation. The life and consciousness in\nall inorganic substances are constantly evolving into higher forms, from earth\nto minerals, minerals to trees, trees to animals, animals to superanimals or\nman, and manto superman, or God-realized man. So, in spite of earth's\nchanges, such as bad weather, reversed seasons, nature's catastrophes, dis-\nease, immorality--all ignorance born of cosmic delusion and man's intelli-\ngence acting under its influence--the divine law of evolution and reincarnation\nis ever trying to reconvert inorganic and organic matter into Cosmic Con-\nsciousness.\n\nThe constant war between satanic delusion and the forces of God is marked\neverywhere in human lives and in all things. Through its misguided indepen-\ndence, nature, or satanic delusion, tries to hide God and glorify itself. It pro-\nduces harmful bacteria that cause diseases in man, and other trials; in the\ntiger it produces the instinct to kill, and various other inharmonies and dis-\ncords of nature.\n\nGod's power, through the law of natural death or change (as against sudden\nuntimely change or premature death) is constantly trying to release finitely in-\nfluenced souls to infinite freedom. The desire for self-defense and the cruel-\nties born of this desire; and the desire to hurt and kill in order to eat, were\nsuggested to man by the cosmic law of delusion, which broke away from the\ninfinite, wise, and loving nature of God to become finite, unreasonable, and\nharmful.\n\nDEPEND UPON GOD, We were made inthe image of God, but satanic delu-\nNOT CHEMICALS sion took advantage of the independence God gave to\n\nman and to all things. To believe that disease, suffer-\ning, and death are perpetually real, instead of acknowledging them only as\ndream-realities, born of ignorance or imagination during a cosmic dream, is\nto reinforce the power of satanic delusion.\n\nOur imagination of the experience of death and disease when we are awake\nis different from the delusive imagination of disease and death--which make\nthese experiences seem real to us--which is instilled by the cosmic delusive\nforce within us. A dreaming man dashing his dream skull against a dream\nwall thinks he is hurt, but as soon as he wakes up he knows it was only a\ndream. And, if a man sits quietly and imagines that he is dashing his skull\n\n"}

But if a man merely thinks that\nhis skull is a dream skull, and dashes it against a wall, the skull will certain-\nly be broken. Only one who beholds Spirit can see that neither the skull nor\nthe wall is real, and so cannot be hurt.\n\nDeath and disease are real to the one under the influence of the sugges-\ntions of the cosmic satanic dream. One can perceive matter as delusion, or\nas 'frozen'' Cosmic Consciousness only when his consciousness and Cosmic\nConsciousness have become one.\n\nTo rely too much on medicine and other material methods for the cure of\ndisease of the body leads to the bad habit of relying solely upon limited aid\ninstead of making use of the limitless healing power of Cosmic Consciousness.\nFood and chemicals are only indirectly helpful to the body. Divine force helps\nthe body directly and also indirectly by causing the food chemicals to operate\nfor the benefit of the body. We should depend more upon God and His direct\nhelp and not foolishly put our trust in chemicals.\n\nPRENATAL AND To make truth win this tug of war between satanic delu-\nPOSTNATAL sion and God's law of evolution and reincarnation, every\nEXPERIENCES human being should meditate upon the laws of right\n\nOF THE SOUL thought and right action that reinforce progressive evo-\n\nlution. One should look upon prenatal and postnatal _\n\n~ न OH ee ~ _ ee ~ न ----\n\nchanges merely as different experiences of the soul. Diseases should be\nlooked upon as the results of broken laws of physical, mental and spiritual\nharmony which, when broken, produce disturbances of the body and of the\npeace of the soul. Disease should be taken as a danger warning, not as a pun-\nishment. Since diseases are the result of one's own ignorant wrong actions,\nthese delusive causes should be uprooted by right application of material and\nspiritual laws.\n\nTry to realize that the soul cannot be affected by disease. Just as a chlo-\nroformed man is unaware of any accident to his body, so by discipline of the\nsenses a man should neutralize the attachment of his consciousness to the body;\nthen he can remain fully conscious but be unaffected by either hurtful or pleas-\nant sensations, at the command of his own will. He should regard the body\nfrom an impersonal standpoint.\n\nThe body is the closest friend and relative of the mind; it suffers only\nthrough identification, closeness of association, and imagination, and for no\nother cause whatever. Do away with mental sensitiveness. You should be\nable to speak, of all experiences as dream experiences, real only to the deep\ndreamer, unreal to one awakened in wisdom. To say to the mortal dreamer\nthat disease and death do not exist is to confuse and delude him. He must first\nbe shown how to awaken in God through meditation; then he will realize that he\n\n| । was only dreaming disease and death.\n\nनै\n"}

Listen to the voice of God first. Never\nFREE CHOICE say: ''I must do this, I can't help myself.'' Remember,\n\nyou have free choice. To think that you like evil ways is\na delusion. No one wants to hurt himself. You love yourself more than you\ncare for anyone else. You will sacrifice for yourself when you will not sacri-\nfice for others. That is why you should do what is of real, lasting benefit to\nyourself. You should not perform any action that brings you sorrow. The law\nof action gives you free choice; you do not have to be influenced by evil. Wrong\nactions leave traces in your consciousness that must eventually be eradicated.\n\nAlthough there are both evil and good in the world, free choice is man's\nsavior. Animals do not have free choice; they know neither good nor evil. | ।\nThey have some intelligence, but live mainly by instinct; and they evolve to\nhigher forms. But man is uniquely endowed with the power of free choice.\nNothing can influence him unless he chooses to accept it. Unless you drink\npoison, you will not die from poison; unless you cultivate hatred, you will not\nfeel the hatred of others in return; unless you are jealous, you will not receive\nthe karmic effects of jealousy.\n\nYOU WILL REAP Your actions will lead either to good or to evil conse-\nWHAT YOU SOW quences. Both virtue and vice flower in activity. But\nthe cycle does not start with action. Thought is even\n\nmore important than action because it is the force that instigates action. Just\nas ideational creation preceded material creation, so thought precedes action.\nEvil or negative thoughts tempt one to perform actions that will be regretted,\nwhereas positive, uplifting thoughts lead to an improvement in one's actions\nand their results.\n\nAccording to Western ethics, you are not considered evil unless your\nactions are evil, and you are not considered virtuous unless your actions are\nvirtuous, but in India it is considered evil to have evil thoughts and feelings.\nAccording to the law of action, or karma, we reap what we sow. This is not\nfatalism. Before you act, you have freedom, but after you act, the effect of\nthat action will follow you whether you want it to or not. That is the law of ©\nkarma.

We always like things that cause our\n\nsensory perceptions to flow outward.\n\nRemember that evil or finite temptation is tempting because you have no\ncomparison. When you permit temptation to overwhelm you, your wisdom is\na prisoner. The quickest way to banish temptation is to first say 1111011 and get\nout of that particular environment; then reason it out later when calmness and\nwisdom return. The best way to avoid being tempted is to be so merged in\nthe bliss of God that all other happiness will only be secondary to that sublime\nstate.\n\nWhy should you let evil wreck you just for a moment of false happiness?\nKeep your will power free from the clutches of bad habits. Replace evil hab-\nits with good ones and then, when you have an abundance of good habits, you\nwill be free and able to fight evil. Never force yourself into being good. Be\nsincere with yourself.

It is also true that one who wishes to become an effec -\ntive speaker or singer must first become familiar with the basic factors that\nwill help him develop his singing and speaking voice.\n\nFOUR FACTORS\n\n1) Proper use of the breath to produce harmonious sounds. As the\nbow proficiently used against the violin strings produces beautiful\ntones, so the breath flowing over the vocal cords in the right way\nproduces the desired harmonious, magnetic sounds.\n\n2) Proper use and care of the throat is important; it should be kept | ।\nfree from hoarseness, and protected from infection at all times.\n\n3) Proper use of the vocal cords, and daily practice of the art of re-\nlaxing and tensing them.\n\n4) Application of will power and concentration.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF CORRECT BREATHING - Correct breathing is very impor-\ntant in speaking and singing.\n\nJust as the bow moves in countless precise ways over the violin strings to pro-\n\nduce music, so the breath, modulated by habit, concentration, and will power,\n\nproduces the desired speech and musical tones as it moves over the vocal\n\ncords.\n\nPractice the following breathing exercise for half an hour before speaking\nor singing, but do not think of the breath or breathing exercise during the act\nof speaking or singing. The principal guiding force in speaking or singing\nshould not be technique, but inspiration, which is roused by the habit of being\ninspired and by the practice of deep concentration.\n\nBREATHING EXERCISE\n\n1. Sit ona straight chair with spine erect and chin parallel to the @\nfloor. Calm yourself.\n"}

Keeping the mouth shut, put the thumb of your right hand on the\nright nostril and very slowly inhale through the left nostril, filling\nthe lungs and expanding the diaphragm simultaneously counting\nrapidly 1 to 25.\n\n3, Then close the left nostril with the forefinger, hold the breath, and\ncount 1 to 6, or 1 to 12 (whichever is comfortable for you).\n\n4. Then open the right nostril by removing the thumb, while keeping\nthe left nostril closed with the forefinger. Exhale slowly, counting\n1 to 25 rapidly.\n\n5. Now reverse the procedure, closing the left nostril and inhaling\nthrough the right to a rapid count of 1 to 25; closing the right nostril\nand holding the breath to a count of 1 to 6 or 1 to 12; and opening\nEa left nostril for a slow exhalation counting 1 to 25.\n\n6. Continue, alternating between inhaling through the left nostril and\nexhaling through the right; and inhaling through the right nostril\nand exhaling through the left.\n\nUse this as a daily exercise, preferably in the morning before breakfast.\nAlso practice it for at least 30 minutes (or for an hour) before delivering a\n\n“speech. “During practice of this breathing exercise, the lungs and abdomen |\n\nshould be inflated simultaneously during inhalation and deflated simultaneously\nduring exhalation. Those who do not practice breathing exercises are usually\nshort of breath, and find the lack of proper breath control a hindrance during\nspeaking or singing.\n\nIt is best to eat very little or nothing at all for at least one or two hours\nbefore public speaking or singing. Overindulgence in any foods, especially in\nmeats, should be strictly avoided in order to stop the accumulation in the\nbloodstream of waste by-products, which leads to faster heart action and con-\nsequent heavy breathing. All public speakers and singers will find long walks,\nor regularly paced moderate running, a very healthful and helpful practice.\n\nTO STRENGTHEN LUNGS Stand erect, extend arms sidewise at right\nangles to the spine.

It is essential to physical well-being always to keep the chest a\nlittle forward and the shoulders held back, even while leaning against the back\nof a chair for rest. Practice will relieve any feeling of irksomeness.\n\nClose the eyes. Very gently contract both sides of the chest. Put the\nwhole attention on the chest while contracting its two sides. Hold the contrac -\ntion, counting 1 to 30. Release the contraction. Repeat six times. Practice\nin the morning, at noon, and at night.\n\nExposing the chest to direct sunlight is very beneficial. Remain outdoors\nas much as possible. Walk slowly two miles every day. Eat plenty of raw\ngreen vegetables and thoroughly ground pecans. Clearing the throat and nose\nwith a mixture of half a teaspoonful of salt in a glass of tepid water early in\nthe morning, at noon, and just before going to bed, has been found quite bene-\nficial.\n\nCARE AND EXERCISE An important factor in voice culture lies in the care\nOF THE THROAT and exercise of the throat, the mouth, the lungs,\n\nand the diaphragm. All public speakers should re-\nfrain from using sour foods (for example, pickles, unripe citrus fruits). It is\ngood for anyone to use a little honey after drinking orange juice. Frequent\nuse of honey is very good. Raw ginger and rock candy are good for the throat.\nPublic speakers who talk for long hours at a time should lubricate their throats\nby putting a piece of rock candy and a small piece of ginger in the mouth, long | ।\nbefore the time of speaking, and sucking onthem. Avoid sore throat through\nregular good habits and right living. Avoid colds by eating lightly at night and\nby eating more fruits and vegetables.\n\nBEST EXERCISE Drop the chin to the chest. Tense the muscles of the\n\nthroat, feeling that your chin is tied to the chest. Then\nslowly lift the chin, pulling against the tension of the throat muscles while the\nhead goes upward. Then relax quickly and drop the chin to the chest. Repeat\ntwelve times morning and night.\n\nIn public speaking it is important not to strain the vocal cords, nor the\nlungs. One should learn to start the breath and the thought waves from the\ndiaphragm and let the breath pass through the lungs and throat into the mouth.\nThe vocal cords should be used to speak loud or soft tones, not by artificial\nexertion, but by inspiration. Those who have no inspiration and try to impress\ntheir audiences through loud speech injure their vocal cords. Deep inspiration\nshould produce loud tones and gentle inspiration should produce soft tones in\nsinging or speaking. Remember that the depth of inspiration should be the\nguiding force of the vocal cords. All sounds should be produced through the\nmouth, inspired by the strength of the abdomen, diaphragm, lungs, and\nbreath trained according to the above-mentioned methods.\n\nCURE OF Remember, if by calmness you can prevent frequent ७\nSTAGE FRIGHT visitation of mild psychological nervousness, you will\n"}

Preparation: To one glass of water add the juice of one quarter of a\nfresh lime and about a tablespoon of sugar or powdered rock candy. Stir thor-\noughly, and add a little crushed ice. It is difficult to give exact measurements\nbecause of the difference in the size of limes, but the drink should not taste like\nordinary limeade one buys at soda fountains. That is far too strong. This\ndrink should be blended so that the sweetness and sourness are equal and you\ncannot distinguish which you are tasting. Sipping two or three glasses of this\nduring a spell of nervousness has been found to be extremely beneficial. If\nthe drink is properly blended, every nerve will feel calm. If you have too much\nlime or too much sugar (never use honey for this special nerve drink), it will\nnot produce the desired result. The blending must be equal.\n\nTECHNIQUE PLUS The daily practice of specially selected, graded vocal\nSOUL INSPIRATION exercises is highly important in the development of\nthe speaking and singing voice.

The criminals waited, fearful and trembling in their chains,\nfor they knew they could anticipate a dire fate at the hands of the much dreaded\ndecree-administrator. But on this particular day, among the criminals to be\nsentenced, there was one who faced the mood-governed official dauntlessly.\nMr. Ali, the village kalu (011 dealer and cultivator), not only did not tremble,\nhe smiled at the Judge, whose satisfaction in his sacred authority was put out\nof joint at this impertinence.

Let me not forget my worthwhile exper-\niences and thus fail to learn the lessons they teach.\n\n11.\nHOW TO CULTIVATE A GOOD MEMORY\n\nWhat is memory? Memory is that power by which you recollect your past\nexperiences. All the reactions and events of your childhood--all the experi-\nences that you have had--are stored in your subconsciousness. These experi-\nences can be reproduced mentally from your subconsciousness by your mental\nfaculties. Thus you may profit by those that contain valuable lessons and dis-\ncard the rest. Memory is essential to our spiritual development. God gave\nus memory lest we forget our experiences and thus fail to learn the valuable\nlessons they teach. An experience that has been forgotten is no longer ours.\nWe cannot benefit from it if we do not remember it.\n\nMemory is active to different degrees in different people, according to\ntheir brain capacity. Some people can remember much more than others. In\norder to develop your memory, you need education, experiences, concentra-\ntion, and meditation. Unless a person has developed his memory, he is not के\nreally educated.\n\nA good way to develop this faculty is to recall all the beautiful things that\nhave happened in our lives. We never tire of reliving in memory our agreeable\nexperiences and good deeds. We should repeat them again and again in our con-\nsciousness by reviving good memories and by performing new good actions in-\nspired by those memories. Thus we may make our lives replete with better\nand better experiences.\n\nSPECIAL EXERCISES One way to develop your memory is to connect what\n\nyou wish to remember with some outstanding event\n| saan. has impressed you; then you won't forget. Memory develops by the asso-\nciation of one thing with another. It is true that most people have a certain\namount of memory ability from birth, but if you limit your ability to remem-\nber by failing to exercise this faculty on an ever wider scale, you limit your\nsoul. Memory can be stretched like rubber. It is eternal, elastic, and can\nrecord many things if you develop it.\n\nAll our faculties have to be cultivated to bring out their true potential. A\npoor memory needs exercise to become a good memory. If you practice addi-\ntion, subtraction, and multiplication mentally, it will help to develop your\n\nmemory. Try also to remember, or to visualize, some object or place or @\nevent. Every day try to recall what you did a week ago that day. That will\n\n"}

However, one should try to remember only the constructive things\nthat have happened.\n\nAnother way to develop your memory is to pay strict attention to the thing\nthat you want to remember. Why do you remember the greatest sorrows of\nyour life? Because you directed more attention to them. Deep attention is a\nstrong force that develops memory. A poor memory usually indicates a ''but-\nterfly'' mind that flits from one object of thought to another, without giving a\ncareful attention to each individual thing. Disciplined exercise of the memo-\nry is very important. You should link one idea with another. Connect certain\nideas, persons, or objects with certain other things that are related and that\nare already firmly fixed in your memory.\n\nThe art of visualization is very important in improving memory. Look\nsteadily at a certain object, or at some scenery, or ina show window, then\nturn away and see how many of the details you can enumerate. The deeper\nyour impressions, the better your visualization, and the more details you will\nbe able to remember.\n\nMost people perform life's duties absent-mindedly. There is a wide gulf\nbetween their actions and their thoughts. That is why they cannot remember\nmuch. It is necessary to put great attention upon whatever you wishto remem-\n1०।-० ~\n\n-~---------- ~~. ---~------------- -- ~ cet -- „५ -- ~ 2» ५ मु ce et ce ~. ~+ ~~ Soe ATE RE IRN MeO \"~\" ~ - = ~ en mr\n\nMEMORY HAS NO The reason you do not remember who you were before\nDISCRIMINATION-- you came to this earth is because you do not possess\nIT IMITATES divine memory. Jesus knew exactly where he came\nfrom, where he was going, and so on. Divine memory\nsuch as Jesus had has to be awakened by development of the mortal memory.\nThis mortal memory is essential to getting the best out of experiences. Mem-\nory does not discriminate. It takes in and stores anything to which you give\nattention, and can be trained to recall any stored impression. To bring back\ninto your consciousness evil things that may have occurred inthe past is a\nmisuse of memory, a very negative uSe of the faculty.\n\nSometimes memory won't let you forget certain impressions. It is there-\nfore unwise to feed memory with the food of wrong thoughts and actions; through\nmemory you will suffer inwardly, as well as outwardly, from their effects. If\neven the most evil habit is constantly practiced, after awhile it will seem to\nyou to be all right; but it will surely lead to unhappiness inthe end. Therefore,\nnever repeat a wrong action.’ Give it up quickly. Do not let it remain in your\nconsciousness, lest it be repeated consciously until it becomes a habit. Then\nthe act is controlled by the subconscious, as are all involuntary actions, and\ncannot be eradicated without repeated determined efforts of will power.

As soon as you have learned the lessons they brought you, @\nscatter them to the winds.\n\nLEARN TO CHOOSE It is necessary to increase the performance capacity\nYOUR MEMORIES of the memory so that it becomes powerful enough to\nremember all the good things that went before. The\nyogis have always taught and demonstrated that memory can be developed by\nexercise. Many scientists, on the other hand, take the view that a person\nwith a hereditary brain defect cannot exercise or develop the faculty impaired\nthereby. However, with greater knowledge of the art of concentration and\nmemory development as taught by the yogis, it will be seen that there is 217\nways something greater if you know where to seek it. Tirough the deepest\nart of concentration and memory development mental changes can be effected.\n\nOne great metaphysician said: 'Memory gives the power of reproduction. ''\nMemory was given to you to reproduce good things. It is not wrong to remem-\nber certain mistakes so that you can avoid them inthe future, but one should\nnot dwell onthem. Nor should you keep in mind the evils of others. If you\ncontinually think of someone whom you intensely dislike, and every day in your\nmind you are hurting him because of your memories of what he did, you are\nmisusing your memory. You should not deliberately recall such experiences.\nThey are gone and do not now belong to you. By remembering a thing, you\nlive it over again. Develop forgetfulness in suchacase. If you can remem-\nber some of the ego's experiences with different people in this life, why can't\nyou remember the experiences that have happened to the soul? Because mor-\ntal memory reproduces the experiences of this life and divine memory repro-\nduces all the experiences of the soul.\n\nGOD IS THE Remember only the beautiful things that you have felt,\nESSENCE OF ALL and seen, and experienced. If your five senses behold\nGOOD THINGS only the good, then your mind will be a garden of blos-\n\nsoming soul qualities, and inthe garden of memory\nthere will be no weeds of wrong thoughts. If you can make your garden pro-\nduce the blossoms of beautiful thoughts, then in that garden of beautiful memo-\nries God will visit you. He who loves all good things and remembers all good\nthings will at last remember God, the essence of all good things. Some day\nan invisible power will shatter all the windows of your memory into one big\nopening through which you may see and remember that you are one with God.\n\neK\nTHE WISHING TREE\nThere was once a hermit of Hindustan, named Hari, who almost wore the\n\nsoles off his feet traveling through the rocky heights of the Himalayas in search @\nof a certain wishing tree!

Although he had learned to consider union with God as\nthe greatest desire, this hermit had not yet freed himself from lesser desires\nand had many lessons to learn!\n\nAlthough Hari could not commune with the Infinite at will, he had neverthe-\nless developed great occult powers because of his austerity and self-discipline,\nand by occasional experiences of spiritual communion. He felt sure that the\ntime had at last arrived when his determined search and his yogic practices\nhad culminated in the accumulation of so much good karma that its stored-up\nmagnetic power, plus the latent divine power now manifesting in him, would\ncombine to reward him with the possession of a wishing tree.\n\nAnd this bud of a wish did burst into a flower of fulfillment when--as he\ntraveled through a snow-walled valley in the interior of the Himalayas--he\ncame across a great leafy tree. Very few people had ever desecrated this\n\nrecognize that the impressive tree was a magic one. He at once approached\nthe tree and stood under it--as legendary rules instruct the seeker to do--and\nprepared to test the occult powers of this strangely endowed creation.\n\nHari closed his eyes and thought: \"If this is a wishing tree, I desire the\ninstantaneous materialization of a mighty castle!'' No sooner had he thought\nthis than a great castle appeared near the tree, surrounded by completely land-\nscaped grounds with trees and gardens. So natural did it appear, one would\nhave thought it had always been there.\n\nEncouraged by this first successful test, Hari made another wish: ''I\nwould like to be attended by bright-eyed damsels--and these fair attendants\nshould serve me with rare foods, heaped on golden plates, and with nectar\nfrom golden goblets. '' Even as he drew his next breath, a feast was spread be-\nfore him, and the golden utensils sparkled in the sun; yet they were no bright-\ner than the sparkling eyes of the graceful maidens who smilingly served him.\n\nDelighted by the instantaneous fulfillment of these two very worldly desires,\nHari then wished for a mighty army to protect him and guard his new treasures.\nLo, there was a mighty army garrisoned near the castle, and armed guards\nstood beside all the doorways.\n\nAfter feasting, Hari walked up the marble stairs and inspected part of his\n\n"}

The low, wide windows overlooked the garden and the deep forest\nbeyond it. Now, the sumptuous room he had chosen was so huge that its dis-\ntant corners were shadowy and dreary. No one was near, and it was very\nsilent--~except for little noises that reached him from the garden and, perhaps,\nfrom creatures that were prowling in the wild jungle beyond. As Hari lay\nfacing the window which looked out on the whispering trees, he felt very much\nalone, and a quiet little fear crept into his mind. As it grew stronger, he auto-\nmatically sent forth another powerful thought: ''Even though an army is here\nfor my protection, not one soldier is outside that open window--and there are\nno bars. The jungle is close, and the beasts are hunting. If a tiger comes\nthrough that window to get me, it will be my finish.\"\n\nJust as this fearful thought enveloped him, a ravenous tiger bolted through\nthe castle window and carried off the terror-frozen hermit! It was too late\nfor him to realize that a wishing tree would fulfill both his good and his bad\nthoughts, irrespective of whether they were actuated by constructive or by\nharmful motives. The business of a wishing tree is to carry out ideas, and this\none ran true to form, faithfully materializing Hari's strong negative visualiza-\ntion. So that was the hermit's last thought!\n\nMy great Guru, Sri Yukteswarji, often used the foregoing story to illus-\ntrate that every man is living in this world beneath his own magic wishing tree\nof all-desire-fulfilling will power. Man's will, being a reflection of the Al-\nmighty Divine Will, has in it the seeds of almightiness. Most people rejoice\nat sudden success inthis life, without stopping to think that success has come\nas a result of continuous will and effort in an unknown past life. It is also true\nthat people who continuously misuse their will power, are surprised when sud-\ndenly they reap evil consequences, forgetting that these, too, were created\nby their own divinely-bestowed wishing tree. If you have not learned to con-\ntrol your desires and wishes and thoughts, be thankful that every uncontrolled\nthought is not instantaneously materialized. Otherwise, how often your pas-\nsions would cause tigerish misfortunes to spring upon others, and upon your-\nself!\n\nSo you must gain wisdom as you strengthen your will. You must be wise\nenough to focus your mind upon good things while you are standing beneath the\nalmighty wishing tree of your will, and to be careful that you do not concen-\ntrate upon fears, failures, diseases, ignorance, and lack of God-communion.\nThey might suddenly loom out of the unseen and cause you unending troubles.\n\nRemember, you were born beneath the boughs of a wishing tree that can\nshower you with success, high accomplishments, and achievements--if your\nthoughts and actions merit them. And so you must not harbor negative\nthoughts, as they will bring nothing but harm to you. And since this invisible\nwishing tree grew from the divine will in you, use it all the time to attain\n\n"}

I bow to Thee everywhere, for Thou art\neverywhere.\n\nIKK\nWHAT INDIA CAN TEACH US--Part 1\n\nAll religious beliefs either originated in India or have been influenced by\nthe scriptures of India. India was the first nation to develop spiritual methods\nthat can lead any persevering student to Self-realization.\n\nIn the beginning each nation, like a child, is busy with material develop-\nment, then with intellectual development, and finally with spiritual develop-\nment. India went through these three stages long ago. Recent archaeological\ndiscoveries have revealed that the civilization of India is older than that of\nEgypt. India precedes other nations in almost all forms of development. It is\nby virtue of centuries of spiritual investigation that India has had a chance to\nput down all dogmas and to understand the ultimate truth. That is why in India | ।\nsince ancient times people with different beliefs have left the formal worship\nof the temples and have gone into quiet places where there are great teachers\nwho live the life, great ones who actually commune with God and who are not\nmerely elected to spiritual office by a church board. India has already gone\nthrough that process of religious evolution. Hinduism is thousands of years\nold.\n\nTRUE MEANING Many people think that Hindus are idol worshipers. This\nOF SYMBOLS is nottrue. The Hindus worship the meaning of their\n\nsymbols. An idol should be a reminder to us of the ideal\nor spiritual quality it represents. When one forgets the meaning and worships\nonly the symbol, then it becomes idolatry. Christians have the Cross as a sym-\nbol of mercy and forgiveness. It 18 not idolatry if, whenever one sees a cross,\nhe thinks of Jesus! loving words onthe Cross: ''Father, forgive them, for\nthey know not what they do \" (Luke 23:34). So in their places of worship the\nHindus have little statues that for them have equally inspiring spiritual mean-\nings. They do not think of God as an idol in a limited material form, but as an\nomnipresent Being.\n\nPANTHEISTIC We should take from Hinduism its pantheistic conception of\n\nCONCEPTION God and its practical, scientific methods of approaching God.\n\nOF GOD Pantheism is a teaching of Yoga philosophy. Man has | ।\nbelieved variously that God is many; or that He is One; or\n\nthat God and matter exist separately. The pantheistic belief is the mostnearly\n\n"}

Buddhists started the first missionary movement\nin India. Buddhism, however, does not give a clear teaching on the conscious-\nness of the ultimate Supreme Being. It teaches that negation or cessation of\ndesire is the goal. Hinduism, on the other hand, teaches that there is some-\nthing to be sought here and beyond: ''From Joy we come, in Joy we live, and\ninto that sacred Joy we melt. '' Through various pathways of ambition we are\nconsciously or unconsciously seeking God. We are all seeking one thing--\nperennial happiness, which is God.\n\nIndia's sages were not interested in identifying themselves with religious\nnames and forms. They sought the ultimate truth, asking: ''What is the sci-\nence that will help me to find God? What is That, knowing which, I shall\nknow 3112\" The Hindus say: ''You do not have to profess any particular reli-\ngious belief; the important thing is to know the method of contacting God. \"'\n\nIt is probable that the fifteen unaccounted-for years of the early life of\nJesus were spent in India with Hindu saints. His entire teaching is in accord\nwith Vedanta truths. However, it does not really matter where the truth came\nrom, Or Who first discovered it. What we are all primarily interested in is\ntruth itself. That Jesus taught Yoga methods of God-communion to his close\ndisciples, to aid in their redemption, is revealed in the little-understood chap-\nter of Revelation in the Bible. There St. John speaks of seven stars and\nseven churches. These symbols refer to the seven chakras or centers of\nlight in man's cerebrospinal axis, explained in Yoga treatises as the seven\ndivinely planned exits or \"'trapdoors'\"' through which the devotee, by meditation,\nmay escape by seven successive steps into Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nHOW TEACHERS India is very particular as to the method of teaching truth.\nARE CHOSEN There the would-be disciple seeks acceptance by a spiritu-\nIN INDIA alteacher, or guru. In the Western world the method is\n\ndifferent; usually the teacher has to coax disciples to ac-\ncept him! The time will come in the West, however, when only those teachers\nwho have lived the life will draw crowds of seeking men and women. Spiritual\ntruths cannot be effectively taught by one who has merely committed scriptural\ntexts to memory. The real spiritual teacher must have experienced and under-\nstood truth before he can successfully transmit it to others.\n\nDuring my spiritual search for a God-realized guru I met three souls of\nexalted character. They truly had God in their hearts. If you were to ask,\n\"Have they a following ?'' I would have to answer, ''No. They live ina little\nhut, with only a few students around them.'' To those in whose eyes success\nis synonymous with a following, it may seem odd that really great teachers\nwould have but a few students. But I would rather sit with one of those saints,\n\n"}

The @\nlook of a holy man has the power to change spiritually persons who are recep-\n\ntive. The sight of a holy man is in itself a blessing to the beholder. The\n\nground on which a saint has walked is thus made sacred. Iused to purify my\n\nbody by rolling in the dust on the ground where such saints had walked.\n\nDay after day, as I sat in meditation with these holy ones, the darkness\nand gloom of doubt began to vanish; I began to perceive that God is real. The\nGod who has been forgotten by almost everyone is sleeping in the vast shroud\nof Nature. Whether you call Him or not, He does not mind. But you can\nrouse Him only by your love and desire to know Him.\n\nIf your heart is ready, if you are desirous of knowing God, and if you con-\ntinuously march toward Spirit, then you will meet the saints of India and you\nwill recognize them. When your heart is not ready, you may meet them and\nyet not recognize them. But once a true teacher has been found, if you follow\nhim with due reverence and with open eyes, you will save yourself years of\notherwise wasted time, for no one can lead you to God unless he himself has\nfirst found God.\n\nThis is the theme of India: that truth should be sought of God-realized\nsaints, wherever they may be found, whether it be in temples or in the solitude\nof mountain or forest. The people of India go to the temples to worship, of | ।\ncourse; but to learn the deeper truths they seek out real teachers, saints who\nhave realized God. Whether such saints live in the woods or teach in a temple\nis of no consequence. The earnest devotee seeks Self-realization wherever he\nmay find it.\n\nTRUTH MUST Dogmatism is not to be admired in any religion, because it\nBE RETAINED _ springs from a materialistic attitude. Churches should be\n\nlaboratories of spiritual experience. When people know\ntruth, i.e., know God, by experience--then dogmas can be done away with. I\nwant to bring to the minds of different religionists this thought: that the time\nhas come to relinquish blind belief in dogmas and to seek Self-realization,\nwhereby the wisdom and love of God freely flow through the mind and heart.\nIt is not my purpose-to show the supremacy of any particular religion, but to\nreveal truth wherever it is. Self-Realization Fellowship does not try to monop-\nolize truth. Self-Realization teachings show you how to discover for yourself\nthe truth in every great religion. Do you see the beauty of that? If youarea\nfollower of one who follows truth, you will know by your own Self-realization\n--not merely by dogmatic belief--that you are God's child.\n\nWe should have nothing but the religion of God--the religion of truth. Let\nus make up our minds to follow the truth. Then, as Jesus said, ''The truth\nshall make you free '' (John 8:32). | ।\n\nWe I\n"}

Having conquered almost all the\nchieftains and princes who ruled different parts of India, he settled at last in\nhis capital at Hastinapur.\n\nAfter enjoying a protracted peace, the emperor began to grow restless.\nSometimes his mind would dwell upon the exultant expectation that he had felt\non the eve of a victorious battle. On the other hand, as he introspected and\nvisualized his past life, scenes of the awful carnage loomed up onthe screen\nof his inner eye, and he began to feel distressed and shocked, remembering\nthe groans of the wounded and the dying.\n\nNevertheless, being tired of peace, the emperor was subconsciously long-\ning to carry on expeditions against certain unconquered hill tribes who reigned\nin the secret regions of forbidden Tibet, walled off by the high Himalayan\nmountains. But even as Bharata felt drawn to a revival of his career as a war-\nrior, his spirit shrank in horror from the thought of killing brave men and\ntheir innocent womenfolk and children, and from the cruel devastation of their\nhard-earned family lands. Torn between these two emotions--desire for, and\naversion to, war-- Bharata suddenly felt a tremendous inner thirst for knowl-\nedge of spiritual matters. He reasoned: 'If God exists, He must be known by __\n\n~at least a few men; and with my money and power I can find and bring here\nsome man who knows about God to share his knowledge with me.'' The aggres-\nsive emperor called together his courtiers and commanded them to issue a\nproclamation throughout his kingdom: that any man who cou'd give the emper-\nor knowledge of God would be munificently rewarded with lands and jewels.\n\nMonths passed. When no one had volunteered to give the much-desired\ninformation, Bharata became annoyed. He summoned the priest of the royal\nfamily, who greeted him thus: \"Iam pleased to be with Your Majesty. I\nshall be gratified to know your royal wish.\"\n\nIn Oriental fashion, the emperor arose from his golden throne and touched\nthe feet of the family priest. Then he said in a subdued but firm tone: ''Hon-\nored priest, lam very curious to know about the cosmos and its Master. You,\nbeing the religious head of our kingdom, ought to be able to satisfy my desire\nfor spiritual knowledge. \"'\n\nThe priest--who was an expert only in the art of mechanically performing\nreligious ceremonies--had little dreamed that he would ever have to answer\n\nsuch a question.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I know the scriptures, but not the God who is mentioned in\nthem, '' he replied. \"Iam only a theologian, not a Self-realized master.

I now demand that you bring me a knowledge of God within seven\ndays!\"\n\n\"But, Your Majesty!'' The priest was interrupted by the emperor: ''This\nis my royal command: Unless you can impart to me knowledge of God within\nseven days, it is my inexorable decree that your head be severed from your\nbody. Now depart!\"\n\nAlmost frozen with fear, the priest slowly backed away and left the royal\nmansion. He went home and related to his wife his unsettling experience. He\npassed four days in terrible anxiety, conscious every moment of his approach-\ning death, for he knew he could not fulfill the emperor's strange demand.\n\nOn the sixth day Ramana, a son of the priest, arrived home and learned of\nhis father's plight. According to the general consensus, Ramana was mentally\nunstable; in reality, however, he was a sage who hid his wisdom under the\nguise of an unbalanced exterior. Ramana gazed with compassion on his terri-\nfied parent and said consolingly: \"Father, be not afraid. Go at once to the\nemperor and tell him that if he does all Iask of him, on the seventh day I will\nfulfill his high wish.\"\n\nThe royal priest at first did not know whether to laugh or cry at the words\nof his son, about whose sanity he had always shared the general mistrust. But\nso insistent was Ramana that his father at last consented to go to the king and\ndeliver Ramana's message.\n\nThe memorable seventh day arrived. The emperor, bursting with curios-\nity to know God, and in compliance with Ramana's request, followed the young\nman and his father into a dark wood. With Ramana leading and the king next,\nfollowed by the priest, the three walked along a sylvan path until they came to\na little secluded plot of greensward on which stood only a few trees, in con-\ntrast with denser sections of the forest. Here Ramana called a halt and asked\nthe emperor and his father to seat themselves ona fallentree. While they\nwere resting, the emperor's attention was attracted to a little bundle that\nRamana carried under his arm. He was distracted from his observation by\nRamana's forceful command: ''Your Majesty, you must do exactly as I tell you\nif you expect to achieve your heart's desire.

Similarly, when the mind enters\nthe superconscious state and becomes united with the Infinite, it knows that it\nknows God, and that the experience is sweet; but there are no words to describe\nwhat that union is like.

First be One with the Creator; when\nyou are awake in God you will see that all creation, including your body, is only\nHis dream.\n\nOne who has attained the divine consciousness does not recognize the exis-\ntence of matter or of medicine; he perceives everything to be Spirit. But without\nthat consciousness one should not drink poison to try to prove that matter does\nnot exist! Similarly, until one has attained some awareness of God as the prime\nhealing factor, he should not deny medicine as an aid to healing. Acknowledge\nwhat good doctors are doing, but try always to exercise the power of mind; you\nwill come to realize then that mind is a greater power than medicine. To live\nmore and more by the power of mind should be your aim. However, until you\nhave become spiritually advanced you cannot live entirely by mind. Give the\nbody good food and then forget it. There are far greater things to study than food.\n\nIndia teaches how to live more and more by the power of mind until you real-\nize: \"God is living in me.'' As you strive deeply to attune yourself with God in\nmeditation, you will see one day, by His grace, that there is no body, no death;\nonly change. But as long as you do not have that realization, do not deny the body\nor medicine. After all, you eat, and food is medicine that builds up the body.\nGet to that state wherein you can live more by mind, independent of physical\naids. Then you can truly realize the truth that matter does not exist.\n\nTHE GREATEST You are a soul, and you have been given intelligence with\nWISDOM IS TO which to solve the soul's problem of freeing itself from\nKNOW GOD the delusive bondage of the body and of matter. The\n\ndivine memory of the soul must be awakened so that you\nmay realize you are not the body; that there is no breath or blood but God's. He\nis the energy in your muscles, in the flowers, in grass; everything is God. You\nmust realize that. But as you look upon creation, which appears so solid and\nreal, remember always to think of it as the thought of God, frozen into physical\nforms. You can condition your mind to this realization in little ways each day.\nWhenever you see a beautiful sunset, think to yourself: 'It is God's painting on\nthe sky. '' As you look into the face of each person you meet, think within: \"It\nis God who has become that form.'' Apply this trend of thought to all experiences:\n\"The blood in my body is God; the reason in my mind is God; the love in my\nheart is God; everything that exists is God.\"\n\nGreater than any other accomplishment is to know your Creator. Awake!\nDo not delay your search for Self-realization, and you will find, if you have the\nzeal, that through Kriya Yoga India has come to you offering diamonds of immor-\ntality. And as you awaken your desire to know God, you shall decorate yourself\nwith immortal realizations, and shall declare your supreme desire to be for God.\nFind God first; then ask Him what you should do with your life. The desire for\nGod should be foremost in your life, whatever your situation may be. You should\n\n"}

The priest was dumbfounded; he fully expected that the imperial wrath\nwould fall upon him and his son if the experiment failed to produce the desired\nresults.\n\nRamana said: ''Your Majesty, please address my father in the following\nwords: ‘Royal priest, you and your forefathers have been maintained by the\nstate treasury for rendering religious services to the royal line.

Then Ramana's anguished\nfather cried out: ''Your Majesty, how can] release you from bondage when I\nmyself am bound ? \"1\n\nBharata glared indignantly at the helpless priest; then, turning his gaze\ntoward Ramana, said: \"It is ridiculous for me to ask your father to release me\nwhen he too is bound. Let me out of this absurd predicament!'' Ominously he\nadded, \"I will slay you both when I am free.\"\n\nRamana gazed steadfastly at the puzzled and suspicious Bharata, who con-\ntinued to thunder abusive threats. Waiting until the emperor paused for breath,\nRamana finally said: 'Your Majesty, wake up! Understand the meaning of this\nexperiment. Behold, it is not my father who can release you from the bondage\nof ignorance; for he, like you, is bound to the tree of life with cords of delusion.\nIt is I, who am spiritually free, who can unbind you both--not only from these\ntree trunks, but also from the tree of worldly life. \"1\n\nBharata was overwhelmed with gratitude as he realized the importance of\nthe lesson. AS soon as he was released, he forgave the royal priest and sought\nto press upon Ramana a reward of land and money. But Ramana steadfastly\nrefused the gift. Bharata then reverentially knelt down on the green earth before\nthe saint and humbly spoke: ''Master, I feel sure that I shall find God-realization\nthrough you, for you have indeed opened my eyes. Please accept me as your\ndisciple. I will do everything you ask of me until I find God. Only a free soul\nlike yourself could free me, also, from the bondage of delusion. \"\n\n"}

Of all God's creatures, only man can real-\n\nize God, because he alone has been given the power to\nreason. Therefore a human incarnation is most precious. To spend one's time\njust playing with life, without seeking and finding God, is to waste the divine\npower within you. The great masters of India determined that reason--not chance\n--governs everything in the universe. And the reason within us tells us that we\ncannot properly conduct our lives without exercising its power. God gave us\nreason that we might use it to solve the mystery of His presence behind the veil\nof maya and, finding Him, find freedom from maya.\n\nSelf-Realization Fellowship is teaching you how to awaken and exercise the\ndivine discriminative reason by which you will be able to distinguish between life-\ntransforming spiritual truths and mere theological beliefs. Learn to develop\ngood judgment. Millions of people do not sufficiently exercise this power. To\ndiscriminate does not mean to become biased; rather it means to perceive the\ntruth and hence to be free of prejudice. It is not enough that truth be perceived;\nit is necessary to act upon it. When you have boiled down your facts by reason\nto form a right conclusion, harness that reason to will power and act according\nto your conclusion. Discrimination is of little value unless it is accompanied by\nactivity along the line indicated. To be discriminative is to be awake and very\nmuch alive; you will be able to perceive the truth in any situation; no one will be\nable to deceive you.\n\nDivine communion of the soul with God will enable you to realize your immor-\ntality and to express yourself in a divine way. Otherwise you become so entangled\nin mortal delusions of earthly life that you forget to use your will properly. The\ndivine soul is really free like the lark in the sky.\n\nHow much do we know about this earth on which we live? A little tremor in\nit and our homes and loved ones may perish. If God were to destroy this little\ncell of the world in which we live, where would we be today? We are literally\nfloating on the outside of a ball, which God is directing in its rotation through\nthe heavens. How little we know about our world! And how dare we forget God, | ।\nto whom we are indebted for our existence!\n\n"}

You must exercise your discrimination and not be influ-\nenced by anything but your own good habits and reason. No one should be able to\ntempt you to do anything that. you don't want todo. You must not be a slave to\nanything. Have you that power?\n\nMost of us act like the little worm in the cocoon, sleeping in delusion; but\nthere are some worms that develop wings, cut through the cocoon, and fly. In\na few years you will be gone from this earth. Why live in uncertainty? Cut\nthrough the cocoon of ignorance and become a divine butterfly before death over-\ntakes you.\n\nSo many people scarcely know that they are living. They are part of the cog-\nwheel of the machine of activity, but they do not know the purpose of life. They\neat, live, multiply, and are gone; such an existence is little better than an ani-\nmal's. Most people think that to have good clothes, fine cars, plenty of money,\nand so on, is keeping up with the times. Far from it! Such people are living\nbehind the times.\n\nDo not sacrifice your soul on the altar of indifference to the Lord. Do your\nduty to God first, and through attunement with Him, do your duty to your family.\nOnce a man said to me: “I have no time for God.'\"' 'Wait a minute, ' I replied.\n\"God is the busiest of all. Suppose He had no time for you? You would be dead. ''\nWe come alone on earth and alone we will go from its shores. Find God first,\nthen everything that you need in life will come to you, and you will not fear death.\n\nRemember the parable of the master and the servants. The master said he\nwas going away for a while. While he was gone the servants took a rest--all\nexcept one, who said: ''The master might return at any moment; I will go on with\nmy work. '' The master did return unexpectedly, and found all his servants idling\ntheir time away. So he kept the conscientious one and discharged the rest.\n\nSo it is with God. You should always be ready to serve Him. Do not idle\nyour time away. Some people accomplish very little that is constructive. Theirs\nis a mechanical existence: eating, sleeping, and doing a little ordinary work. As\nhuman beings, divinely endowed with reason, will, and choice, you should do\nmore than this. Use discrimination in your thoughts and actions every day.\nAccomplish something worthwhile. Do not waste your time. Find out what you\nare and why you are here.\n\nTo acquire all the wisdom in the world would be impossible in one lifetime if\nyou had to get it from books, but there is another angle of approach. To have\ncosmic consciousness means to know all things. The soul within you is the divine\nlink with the cosmic consciousness of God. You really contain all wisdom within\nyourself; but it is necessary to know how to be aware that you have it.\n"}

He should mentally feel\nhimself omnipresent with the whole atmosphere around the earth. He should feel @\nthe sun's rays as his muscles. He should feel the moonlight as his love, beautify-\ning everyone and everything on which its beams fall. He should feel himself sail-\ning in the clouds, waking in the buds, trembling in the blades of grass. He should\nfeel himself as the cushion of earth, offering his services to others who may walk\nupon him.

In\nMEDITATION order to hold infinite truth, intelligence must be expanded or\n\nenlarged by meditation until it becomes a boundless cup of\nintuition. Intuition is that power of Spirit inherited by the soul, by which the soul\ncan perceive all things directly without the medium of any other faculty. Man\nordinarily uses the powers of sight, hearing, and the other senses, and of the\nmind, in order to know about any truth. The senses and mind do not always give\na true picture of things, however; and then reason builds a wrong conclusion from\ntheir impressions. The soul--Spirit's reflection in man--does not require the\nsenses or the mind to perceive substance. It sees into things through the directly\nperceiving power of intuition.\n\nTo study scriptures only from an intellectual standpoint keeps the truth locked\nup in the mind, unassimilated and undigested.

An untimely death by illness is painful and ob-\nstructive. It prevents the fulfillment of that individual's past karma and cuts\nshort his present-life opportunity to carry out the wish of God for which he is\non earth: to seek and find his Creator.\n\nUntil the soul has completely worked out the effects of egoistic prenatal\nand postnatal actions, and has found liberation, one should not deliberately\nseek exit from the bodily house; he would still have to come back to finish the\nkarma he left undone. But if death comes suddenly in spite of one's desire to\nstay on earth, one should not then resist or be unwilling to depart. Young peo-\nple rebel when they suddenly have to make an exit owing to sickness or acci-\ndent. They are full of hope and enthusiasm to work out a program of life ac-\ncording to their inner urge; they are not ready or willing to face an untimely\ndeath.

Then, and then only,\ncan those who are united with Him stay on earth as long as they want to--for\na little while or for a long time.

But if souls\nseek the guidance of saints and meditate and lead the right kind of life accord-\ning to the will of God, they become liberated. The liberated apparently die\nlike any other person; but they do not suffer the mental agony of death. To\nthem the experience is only a transition of the soul from a limited body to a\nlimitless kingdom of omnipresent Spirit.\n\nThe undesirability of an untimely death becomes quite obvious when we\nconsider that if a soul-prisoner is forced by some disease to leave the bodily\njail he will be obliged to work out his term of flesh confinement in another\nlife. The soul's home is omnipresent, blissful space--there it dwells with its\nFather, Spirit. The prodigal soul is jailed in flesh, and must work out its\nterm. As some prisoners who live long in the confinement of jail grow 2.८ -\ncustomed to it and even begin to like it, so some souls, long caged in the bodi-\nly prison, grow attached to the body and feel exceedingly great pangs of fear\nand sorrow when the time to leave it arrives. The pain in death is due more\nto the psychological factor of egoistic attachment to the body than to physio-\nlogical suffering.\n\nThe liberated man does not have to experience death attended by uncon-\nSciousness, oblivion, pain, and fear. He joyously, consciously, fearlessly,\nand painlessly leaves the body. To be released from a prison one must first\nhave entered the prison. When the soul enters and becomes identified with\nthe body, it forgets about the unlimited kingdom of Spirit which it forsook in\norder to incarnate on earth; and it is because of that forgetting that it finds\n\nthe exit from the body at the time of death painful and unpleasant.\n\nTo liberate the soul it is necessary to avoid dying in ignorance. But to\nfree itself from the experience of death, the soul must first avoid entering a\nbody-prison; and the way to avoid that is to cease creating and pursuing materi-\nal desires which cannot be satisfied anywhere except on the material plane,\nand which therefore make it necessary for the soul to reincarnate.\n\nMETAPHYSICAL WAY OF The metaphysical way of overcoming death is\nOVERCOMING DEATH to live ''in the world, but not of the world\"; to\n\nact upon the world stage, but remain unaffect-\ned by the role one has to play. Therefore, desirelessness should be prac-\nticed. Desirelessness means, not supine inactivity or spinelessness, but\nperforming only good actions to please God instead of acting mainly to satisfy\nsome desire of the self. Performing all actions for humanity in order to please\nGod is the way to overcome rebirths, and consequently the pain, fear, and at-\ntachment involved in death. He who is born must die; and he who lives igno-\nrant ly must die and be born again. He who is born in ignorance and escapes\nthe prison of flesh while still in ignorance must experience life and death\nagain and again. When one performs all actions for God, he thereby obviates\nthe rebirth-making effects of his actions and so becomes free.\n"}

It is only when life retires from the spine, brain, and\nDEATH particularly from the medulla oblongata, that death occurs and\n\ndecay commences. When decay starts in the outer body, it also\nbegins inside the body and death becomes a fact. Neither the cessation of\nbreath and pulse, nor inertness of muscles, limbs, and cells is a certain sign\nof death. Before the science of embalming was widely known, people whose\nheart and breath apparently had ceased were sometimes cremated or buried\nwhile life was still present inthe spine. In such cases, life could have been\nbrought forth again from the spine. ।\n\nMAN'S LIFE FORCE The ''tree of life'' is the spinal cord in man's body; the\nIS CENTRALIZED IN roots of this tree are the hairs of the head, its branch-\nBRAIN AND SPINE es are the afferent and efferent nerves connecting all\nparts of the body with the life in the spine. The life\nin this tree is centralized in the medulla oblongata at the top of the spine. If\nanything happens to the medulla, death of the physical body ensues. In some\nplants life is not thus centralized; one may cut off part of a root or a stem and\nfrom that grow a new plant. But a severed limb of the complex human body-\nplant is incapable of producing a new body; it is dependent for life upon the\ncentral source in the medulla oblongata.\n\nES. VARIOUS STATES In the human body death occurs by stages in the\nOF PHYSICAL DEATH following way: |\n\n1. Muscular paralysis or inertness due to the retirement of life\nforce from the muscles, and paralysis of motor (movement-\nmaking) nerves.\n\n2. Muscular and sensory relaxation due to deterioration of tactual\nsensory nerves carrying sensations of touch to the brain.\n\n३. Paralysis of the olfactory and gustatory nerves; the dying man\nceases to be able to smell or taste anything.\n\n"}

The shutting-off of the auditory nerves; the dying man becomes\ndeaf.\n\nWhen the tactual nerves of a dying person cease functioning, preventing\nthe consciousness of touch sensation, he can no longer feel his body, the bed\non which it is resting, or even the atmosphere. Almost everyone has had the\nexperience of having a leg or an arm ''go to sleep.'' The whole body of a dying\nperson undergoes this experience. A person whose leg has ''gone to sleep\" is\naware of and sees that limb, but is unable to move it. So also the dying man\nis aware of his body and sees it (until the optic nerves and muscles are para-\nlyzed); but he is powerless to act with it. His condition is very much the same\nas that of a completely paralyzed invalid; conscious but unable to move at will.\n\nEven when paralysis has extended to the heart, lungs, and liver, as well\nas the limbs, death is not complete. The life force first retires from the\nmuscles, then from the heart and senses; and remains locked up in any of the\nseven spinal plexuses--coccygeal, sacral, lumbar, dorsal, cervical, cere-\nbral, and medullary. Painless consciousness, like a deep sleep state, may\nbe retained for a time in the spine.\n\n——-A mran-whose-arm is paralyzed does not feel anything even if the arm is~~\nseverely burned. So also a dying man experiences no pain from the gradual\nparalysis of his feet, arms, abdomen, liver, stomach, chest, and head. Only\nthe paralysis of the lungs causes pain, through the sense of suffocation. This\nis, in fact, a mental pain.\n\nTHE SOUL'S EXISTENCE Most of the time a man is not conscious of his\nIS NOT CONDITIONED breath, even though he breathes constantly.\nBY BREATH So it is with the spiritually wise man during\n\ndeath: when paralysis of the lungs ensues, he\ndoes not feel suffocation because he knows that the soul's existence is not con-\nditioned by breath. The spiritually ignorant man thinks that his soul, or life,\nis dependent on breath, so he feels the pain of suffocation, just as in night-\nmares one may experience the stifling sensation of asphyxiation, while in\npeaceful sleep there is no consciousness of the indispensability of breath.\n\nPAIN OF DEATH Pain is not felt during sleep; and when the final sleep of\n\ndeath occurs there is no pain. Death is the cessation of\nall bodily suffering; it is a parole from the prison house of flesh. Death auto-\nmatically dismisses all bodily pain, just as sleep banishes the weariness and\naches of the hard-worked body.\n\nA paralyzed man may inwardly grieve because he cannot move his limbs\nor stir up life in his helpless body.

Even though the scrip-\nPERCEPTION tures say that God is beyond the comprehension of\n\nthe mind and senses, He is knowable--through the\nintuitive perception in man. In the world men are taught from childhood to de-\nvelop the powers of the senses; few learn of the sixth sense--intuition--and\nhow to develop it.\n\nSage Patanjali said that the ultimate proof of substance--the Noumenon--\nconsists in Pratyaksha (direct sensory perception), Anuman (inference), and\nAgama (intuition), \"that which comes of itself.\"\n\nAgama is sometimes assigned the limited meaning, \"authority of the scrip-\ntures.'' But this is untenable, for both reformers and real prophets have\nclaimed that they perceived truths and received their bibles from God Himself.\nAn intelligent bandit might write a good book and through the power of his intel-\nlectuality convince readers that he has received it from God. How can one find\nout whether the Bhagavad-Gita, the Bible, the Koran, the Zend-Avesta, the\nBuddhist scriptures, or any other intellectually precipitated bible, is of divine\norigin?\n\nNo one scripture can be taken as the perfect authority, for all scriptural\ndata has to be conceived through the limited power of the senses. The real\ntruth and divine origin of a scripture may be proved only by divine perception.\n\nAll scriptural revelations should therefore be tested with the intuitive per-\nception developed by meditation. All scriptural truths recorded through the\nintuitive perception of real saints can be proved true by any person of realiza-\ntion in any age.\n\nINTUITION TRANSCENDS THE Kant inhis \"Critique of Pure Reason\" shows\nLIMITATIONS OF REASON the limitation of reasgn, which ultimately\ndepends upon delusive sense perceptions;\n\nhence the power of inference can not bring out much more of truth than already\nhas been supplied by the senses.

Hence intuitive perception is required to find\n@ the ultimate proof of truths.\n\nINTUITIVE PERCEPTION Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yuktes-\nCOMES THROUGH warji, Krishna, Jesus, Buddha--all true sons of\nCONTACT WITH AUM God realized the presence of God through their\nintuitive perception and declared Him and His\nmanifestation on earth. Thus all who meditate and interiorize their minds will\nlikewise intuit the presence of God. ''The way to the Ultimate can be traversed\nby pursuing the line of intuitive perception as followed and practiced by men of\nrealization. '' Sage Patanjali said that God can be realized through meditation\nwith the intuitive perception (and not by the restless mind). He speaks of God\n8 'Aum, '' that is, Cosmic Intelligent Vibration.\n\nThe Bible speaks of God as the Word (John 1:1) and as the Holy (५०8४ (holy,\nghostlike vibration, which is the creator of all things) and as the Amen, ''the\nfaithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God\"! (Rev. 3:14). The\ncosmic sound of the Amen accompanies all creation, as sound accompanies a\nrunning motor. The Bible also says: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the\nWord was with God, and the Word was God\" (John 1:1). That is, in the begin-\nning of the creation of solids, liquids, gases, energy, and mental manifestations\nwas the Word, or the Cosmic Vibration.

Without the intelligence imbedded in the womb\nof vibration there might be only solids, or everything might be liquid, or there\nmight appear gross inequalities in nature, such as human beings, but no food.\nThe harmonious relation between man and his ordered cosmic environment--\nsunshine and showers--shows that the universe, all matter, is governed accord-\ning to an intelligent scheme. Science and religion can both agree to the pres-\nence of God asthe Intelligent Cosmic Vibration that creates all things percepti-\nble by the senses. The storm of Cosmic Vibration has chopped the ocean of\nInfinity into waves of finite creations.\n\nThe Word, or the Cosmic Name as it is sometimes called in the Hindu\nscriptures, is the vibratory physical manifestation of the transcendental God.\nGod the Father is the Sat (transcendental Absolute existing beyond all creation).\nAnd the Tat is the intelligence of the transcendental God actively reflected in\nall vibratory creation. This Tat is spoken of as the Christ Intelligence. The\n\"only-begotten Son\" of the Christian scriptures is this Christ Consciousness\n(Kutastha Chaitanya)--the only reflection of the Father's intelligence manifest-\ning in Creation.

Pranava has been described in the Upanishads as Nirabacchinna (con-\n\ntinuous), Taila dharamiba (like the smooth-flowing oil), Deerghaghanta (long\npeal of gong), Hinadabat (sound), Abachyam (unutterable), Pranava (ever-new,\never-inspiring); Bangam jas-tam-bada (he who knows that) Sa Badabit (knows\nVeda or all Truth to be known).\n\nThe Aum sound is the lullaby of cosmic Christna (God manifesting as Christ\nConsciousness) continuously oozing out of the pores of space like smoothly flow-\ning oil; it is like the peal of a cosmic gong, reverberating, energizing all crea-\ntion. The Divine Bard produces His cosmic symphony on the harpstrings of\natomic creation.\n\nHe who has heard and become one with the cosmic song of creation knows\nthe practical way of contacting God. This song, emanating from countless flutes\nof electrons, is unutterable by the human voice. Many people think that Patan-\njali's counsel to: \"Think of that sound and chant 10\" means to chant ''Aum\" with\nthe human voice. But the Aum sound, having a very high rate of vibration, can-\nnot be uttered by the human voice. Of course, one may try to imitate Aum by\nchanting, and the scriptures speak of loud chanting, whisper chanting, mental\nchanting, and superconscious chanting of Aum. Loud, whisper, and mental\nchanting are performed by imitating the real Cosmic Sound with the voice, aloud\nor mentally, and have very little real meaning. But when by Pratyahara (interi-\norizing the attention) and Pranayama (life-force control, switching off the five\nsense telephones) one disconnects his mind from the senses and contacts God\nas Aum, then he perceives the inner world; his first discovery of God is through\nthe Cosmic Sound.\n\nBut chanting the Cosmic Name with the mind on bodily perceptions, is of\nlittle use. Jesus asked devotees not to take the name of God in vain. No one\nmay gain divine perceptions by parroting the name of God--Aum--while the\nmind is on something else. When the devotee repeatedly puts his flagging and\nrunaway attention upon the real, intuitionally heard cosmic sound of Aum emana-\nting from the Cosmic Motor, that is called superconscious chanting and medita-\nting upon Aum's cosmic significance--which Patanjali asked his followers to do.\n\nThat devotee who by eightfold Yoga finds God as Aum really contacts God\nand solves the riddle of his Self and of the Cosmos. A name consists of a\nsound, a significance, a thought, and the energy required to utter it. All this\nis involved in uttering the word ''Rama'\"' for instance. The Cosmic Name signi-\nfies cosmic sound, cosmic intelligence, cosmic energy.\n\nFurther, it should be realized that this cosmic sound emanates from all\natoms, for where there is activity there is sound. The cosmic motor is work-\ning and Aum is the resulting sound. The human ear can perceive a certain\nrange of vibrations only, and the human voice can utter sounds of a certain | ।\nrange only. The Aum sound, being the emanation of countless high and low vi-\nbrations, is inaudible to physical ears and unutterable by the human voice.\n"}

When by deep concentration\none draws the consciousness away from outer physical noises and from the\ninner physical sounds of blood and heart, and then raises it above the astral\nsounds of the bumble bee, flute, and harp in the spine, one can go beyond the\nlimitations of the physical and astral bodies and listen to the cosmic symphony\nof Aum.\n\nAdvanced yogis, by concentrating upon this Aum, find that in His aspect of\nthe Cosmic Sound God also manifests as cosmic ever-new Bliss, cosmic Wis-\ndom, cosmic Love, cosmic Light, and cosmic Life Force. These are definite\nqualities of God.\n\n=| disciples, on the day of Pentecost were filled with the Holy Ghost,\n\nor Cosmic Sound, and could talk in many languages.

This Cosmic Sound, being the foun-\ntain of all sounds, is therefore the fountain of all languages and inspirations.\nJesus, Patanjali, and all great masters who know God, speak of the Holy Ghost\nor Aum or God and His Name.\n\nOnly those can know God who, through meditation and samadhi (ecstatic com-\nmunion) superconsciously utter His Cosmic Name with the lips of intuition.

The first stage of devel-\nopment is physical; then comes intellectual development; and lastly, concen-\ntration on the spiritual goal of life. The difference between the Eastern and\nWestern approach to education is this: The East says: ''Expand the intuitive\npower to receive truth. '' The West says: ''Pump ideas and the contents of\nbooks into the brain. '' Concentration and the intuitive faculties have to be\ndeveloped in order to expand the power of the mind so that it can assimilate\nthe facts you feed it.\n\nIt would take millions of years to study all the various types of knowledge\nto be investigated in the world; the average lifetime is not long enough. The\nmasters of India found that it is possible to assimilate wisdom from the in-\nfinite \"800 of Knowledge'' or universal consciousness of God, provided the\npower of recipiency is increased. Geniuses are persons born with superior\nbrains owing to development of the mind in past incarnations. It is necessary\nto be well advanced mentally at birth in order to become a genius in this life.\n\nJesus Christ had knowledge of life, of the earth, of everything that is to\nbe known. How did he obtain this knowledge? Not through blind prayer.\nJesus was a true yogi; he had so developed his soul-faculty of intuition in past\nlives that his consciousness was in tune with the consciousness of God that\npervades the whole universe. Jesus knew and operated spiritual laws which\nwere known and taught by masters of ancient India.\n\nYou should learn the intuitive method of study. You would then be able to\nassimilate in a few days knowledge that would otherwise take years to acquire.\nGeniuses are made by developing the power of intuition. Overcome the limita-\ntions of your mind and expand the power of your meditation so that truth will\nnot have to be gained solely through the intermediaries of eyes, ears, and\nbrain, but may be received directly through intuition.\n\nNATURE IS We are supposed to learn from history, and the most absorb-\nLIKE A BOOK ing history is that of life itself.

Rain clouds had been playing in the sky, pouring a great deal of wa-\nter into the ordinarily peacefully flowing Jumna. The trampling rain made\nher as boisterous as an excited mare, and she tossed and threatened to sink\nany boat that ventured to ride upon her.\n\nWhen finally the rains' myriad feet had ceased their pattering on the\nwatery floor of the river, the angry roar of the water could still be heard. At\nthis moment the melodious voices of several women saints, the angelic gopi-\nnees, distracted the sage from his meditations.\n\nLaying down their baskets full of milk-made sweetmeats, the gopinees\nseated themselves around the sage, looking helplessly at the raging river they\nwished to cross. Vyasa addressed them ina kindly voice, saying: 'Sacred\nsouls, what can Ido for you? Please command.\"\n\nThe gopinees answered: ''Honored Sage of almightly power, please do .\nsomething so that we can get to the other bank of the turbulent Jumna. No\nboat will take us across.\" | ।\n\n"}

We must. get there some way for we are carrying freshly made\nsweetmeats for him,'' the gopinees replied.\n\nThere appeared on the face of the sage a mysterious, michievous little\nsmile as he retorted: \"Aha! I see you all think of Krishna alone and not of\nme. Iwon't do anything until you have allowed me to share in those sweets. ''\n\nAs one, the gopinees exclaimed: ''How dare you blasphemously ask to\ntaste the sweets now, when they are meant first to be blessed by the sacred\nlips of our guru, Lord Krishna?\"\n\nBut Vyasa was stubborn, and kept repeating: ''Nothing will Ido to help\nyou unless I participate in the pleasurable taste of those delicate sweets. ''\n\nSeeing no other way, and being possessed with an irrestible desire to pay\ntheir respects to Krishna, the holy gopinees at last offered some of the sweets\nto the sage, who kept on eating until he could eat no more! Some of the gopi-\n~ x | oo. .nees were inwardly.criticizing the all too-healthy appetite of the sage and his\ndisrespectful act of eating the sweets before his guru, Lord Krishna, had\ntasted them.\n\nFinally Vyasa, stuffed with food, somehow moved himself to the brink of\nthe boisterous river and loudly exclaimed: 16 River Jumna, made holy by the\nsacred feet of my omnipresent Krishna, if Ihave not eaten anything, divide\nand part!''

The\nJumna had responded to God's command, for the Lord's omnipresent mind\nhad instantly become aware of the implicit plea for His help in the words of\nhis devotee, Vyasa.\n\nIn the state of divine ecstasy the devotee finds complete oneness with God.\nHe then realizes that God is seeing, smelling, touching, hearing, and tasting\nthrough him. In that state he no longer feels, as one does in ordinary human\nconsciousness, that he (that is, the ego) rather than God, is responsible for\nactions.\n\nJesus knew he was one with the Father; that is why, whenever he made\nstatements suchas: ''The Heavenly Father make thee whole,\" or \"I say unto\nthee, arise, '' he did not feel any difference between the two statements.

Inthe state of\ndivine unity, it matters little whether a master says: ''May the Heavenly\nFather in me make thee whole,'' or \"1 (as one with the Father) command thee\nto be whole.\" ह\n\nThe story of Vyasa contains the moral that all true lovers of God should\nso meditate upon Him, and be in such ecstatic joyous communion with Him,\nthat He will be considered responsible for all their actions. Of course, before\nthis divine union is attained, it is wrong to say: ''God is doing everything, not\nI.\" For by this excuse one could approve of all his wrong actions, pretending\nthey are the actions of God. One's conscience must not be made blunt. When\nyour conscience tells you that an action is wrong, it is wrong.

Desires and egoistic at-\ntachment to the body flee like darkness before the light of the soul's con-\nsciousness of Omnipresence.\n\nIn the psychological battle between good and evil tendencies, bad habits\nthink themselves of sufficient importance to crush good habits. The bad hab-\nits do not realize the strong part that material desire and ego play in their ex-\nistence. An invading good habit can distract the mental tendencies of a bad\nhabit so that they have no time to pay attention to King Material Desire and\nhis tendency to cling to the ego or body consciousness.\n\nIt is a fact that in meditation the devotee finds his body consciousness re-\nsisting the consciousness of Omnipresence. He also finds that the ego con-\nsciousness often wants to make an encouraging noise, as in breathing fast,\nthus inviting the senses to destroy the breathlessness of meditation. The min-\nute the ego induces the breath to come fast (described in the Hindu scriptures\nas the blowing of the conch shell which produces material sounds through the\naction of the air), then material desire is awakened and cheered, and fights\nto drive away the vast Spirit Consciousness which is born of our stillness and\nmeditation.\n\nDuring meditation, any material vibration sent forth by the ego helps to\nawaken the material desire to revive the consciousness of the body, and to\ndispel the consciousness of the vastness in Spirit. After ego creates a materi-\nal vibration, the senses also begin to create different vibratory sounds in\norder to drown out the musical astral sounds of the discriminative tendencies\nin the cerebrospinal centers.\n\n"}

You should make full\n\nuse of your opportunity. Do not waste your time in idleness,\nnor forget the higher things of life and plunge like the moth into flames of ma-\nterial desire. When you plunge in, the lure is sweet, but after a while you\nwill realize your mistake. He is cleverest who seeks God.\n\nWhen you lose attachment for material things, then you are free. When\n\n@— 2: can eat with the consciousness of eating in order to build God's temple,\n\nthen your Consciousness is not limited by attachment to the food; but if you eat\nlike a greedy man you are limited by that desire for food for its own sake. Do\nnot be bound by material attachments. Anything that overclouds your divine\nconsciousness is a detriment to your welfare. I learned from my Master how\nto be free, how to enjoy good things in life and yet not become attached. Any-\nthing that you become too much attached to, or bound to, will cause your down-\nfall from the soul consciousness that is your divine birthright.\n\nAll our present troubles are the result of our own wrong actions in this\nlife or in past lives. We must be given time to work out our imperfections\nand desires by returning to earth in a physical body again and again. When\nwe are purified, we can go back to God. Our imperfections cannot be worked\nout in one lifetime, but we can quicken our evolution in one lifetime if we de-\nsire todo so. Just as you can go around the world by cart and boat in a cer-\ntain number of years, or you can take an airplane and go around the world in\na day or two, so by the methods taught by the great sages of India you can\nwork out your desires, free your soul from bondage to desire, and thus go\nback to God sooner.\n\nREINCARNATION This world is a cosmic show. Do not leave it with ma-\nIS BASED terial desires. According to the law of cause and effect,\nUPON DESIRES if you die with unfulfilled desires you will have to incar-\n\nnate again to satisfy them. If you could but realize the\namount of trouble that goes with attachments, you wouldn't burden yourself\nwith them.\n\n"}

Those who are ignorant of their soul-nature now have\nbroken some of God's laws in the past. What a man is today is the sum total\nof all his past actions. In order to overcome the limitations that he ascribes\nto himself in the ego-conscious state, man has to return to earth again and\npurify himself.\n\nReincarnation is based upon desires. The average person requires sever-\nal incarnations to work out all desires, once he has determined to shed them.\n\nThe soul, being superior to the body, survives it and passes into another\nbody, so that it may work out on this earth plane the earthly karma of past\nlives spent in the ego-conscious state and present-life karma of egoistic ma-\nterial desires.\n\nReincarnation is made necessary because of unfulfilled desires. So long\nas we have mortal desires we shall have mortal incarnations. But once you\nhave experienced the presence of God there will be no other desire, for the\ndesire to know God counteracts all longings pertaining to the material world.\n\nDO ALL Never become attached to anything.

Then God will give you what He\nwants you to have. Spiritualize your desires and ambitions and only desire\nto please God in everything you do.\n\nThe Bhagavad-Gita says: ''Those who forsake action and yet are always\ndesiring to perform actions are not free; but those who act in the best way to\nplease God, they are free.'' If you do your work feeling that you are doing it\nto please God, then you will be happy. Work for Him; then you will leave no\ntrace of desire behind you. Once you gain this power over reincarnation,\nthen you can come on earth of your free choice to bring others back to the\nshores of Omnipresence.\n\nWhen you wake up in another life, you will be exactly what you were be-\nfore death. Unless you practice being in a high state of consciousness now,\nyou will not attain it after death. Those who think that just by dying they will\nbecome angels are mistaken. Become an angel now and you will be one after\ndeath. Someday you will wake up in God and see that you are not a fleshly\nbeing but life eternal. So do away with the necessity for further incarnations\nby performing all actions for God.\n\n"}

Its material consciousness, as the\n\nego, travels outside beyond the star and remains in the medulla oblongata,\nwatching through the sense channels the body and the world of matter which is\nlimited by form, space, time, and so forth.

By the application of intuition,\nthe spiritual eye and the heart become radiolike receiving stations, and by con-\ncentration of will power they become astral broadcasting stations.\n\nVoices, music, and songs pass through the ether.

But just as no sounds can\nbe dug out of the ether without a radio, so, without the \"radio\" of the spiritual\neye, the senses cannot register tactual, olfactory, gustatory, auditory, or op-\ntical sensations. The spiritual eye can perform two functions: it can act asa\nradio receiving apparatus, and as a broadcasting station. Intuition passing\nthrough the heart into the spiritual eye transforms it into a receiving station.\nIntuition and feeling tune the spiritual eye to receive the messages of the five\nsenses; or any message or thought passing through the ether; or the vibratory\n'picture'' of distant or future events. All auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and\ntactual vibrations can be changed by concentration into visible, optical visions\nin the spiritual eye. The vibratory thought patterns of an incident that is to\nhappen in the future may be present in the ether now, owing to the action of the\nlaw of cause and effect; if these fine vibrations are made to pass through a\nheart tuned by intuition, and are relayed to the spiritual eye, they vibrate in\nmyriads of life atoms, organizing and arranging them into definite designs,\nforms, or visions of the future.

The eyes of young children are\nusually turned upward to the superconscious center during sleep. As they\ngrow up and begin to concentrate their vision more and more on the material\nworld about them, their eyeballs turn downwardwhen they are asleep.

When the two eyeballs are upturned and\ntheir gaze fixed at the point between the eyebrows, they become supernaturally\nstill; then the two parallel searchlight currents in the two eyes are focused on\none point, producing the vision of the single eye, which is the reflection of the\nlight in.the medulla. When this light is seen in the forehead and when it re-\nmains still for a long time, or can be held as long as one wants it to stay, then\nthe optical current of the eyes, which is accustomed to playing on matter, be-\ncomes reversed and centralized, first between the eyebrows; then it becomes\ntransferred to the medulla.

By unraveling the mystery of sleep,\nman can learn the nature of his true being and realize his oneness with the\nSource of all being. God--in the unmanifested aspect of Spirit--is omnipresent,\never-conscious, ever-newly joyous, limitless Being. Soul--the image of God\n--is ever-conscious, ever-newly joyous individualized Being, confined in the\nmental, astral, and physical bodies by rebirth-making mortal habits and de-\nsires. Inthe ecstasy of Self-realization the soul knows itself to be a perfect\nbut body-confined reflection of God, like a reflection of the moon seen clearly\nin a pot of water undisturbed by any breeze. So by yoga the individual soul\nmay behold itself as a reflection of God's ever-newly joyous Being, undisturbed\nby the breeze of desires.\n\nIf a pot of water in which the moon is reflected is broken, then the confined\nimage of the moon becomes one with the big skyey moon. Similarly, when the\nlittle soul-reflection completely destroys its identification with the ego--the\nbody-bound pseudo-soul or \"I'' of one's wakeful hours--then the soul has learned\nhow to liberate itself from the three bodies (physical, astral, and mental) and\nbecomes established in its real, perfect nature as the blissful image of God,\nomnipresent and ever blissful.\n\nDuring waking hours, through the ego, everyone except a true yogi per-\nceives himself as a man or a woman and as owner of various material things.\nAt night, while in a passive state, the body-identified soul or ego realizes its\nown true invisible joyous nature. By practice of yoga and nonattachment, the\nyogi may behold himself always, at night or by day, as the perfect image of\never-blissful God. By meditation and conscious ecstasy the soul becomes es-\ntablished in its true nature and is liberated from its mortal nature or ego.\n\nA strong man slept and dreamed he was a weakling. He cried because he\nwas weak and diseased. Somebody woke him up and asked him, ''Do you know\n\nyou were praying for muscles and strength?\" ''How silly, '' the strong man\nsaid, ''that I dreamed myself to be a weakling, when actually Iam strong asa @\nSandow.'' The soul is drunk with delusion, the somnambulism of daily wake-\n\nfulness, and acts and grieves like a mortal man. This body-identified state\n\n"}

This ego, or mortal state of the soul, is partially\nforgotten during sleep and entirely forgotten during ecstasy. That is why you\nwant to practice ecstasy--to get rid of the ego, the nest of all your imaginary\ntroubles, and remember that you are made in the image of God.\n\nGOD EXPLAINED God is Cosmic Consciousness, Cosmic Love, Cosmic\n\nBliss, Cosmic Wisdom, and so on. God sees, hears,\nsmells, tastes, touches, feels, thinks, and knows everything solely by intu-\nition. Soul in its perfect state is superconscious, body-confined love and joy,\nand knows all things by intuition also.\n\nThe ant feels its body. Its small eyes perceive a little territory around it.\nThe average man knows his body, house, and family. The superman knows\nthat his body is part of all the human family; his mind holds the universe in its\nmental and perceptive boundaries. He realizes that ''on a little speck of thought\nrests the cosmic lot.'' If you rub out your thoughts with sleep, unconsciousness,\nconscious ecstasy, or even anesthetics--the universe will vanish into nothing-\nness. Your thought gives reality to the universe; without it the cosmos cannot\nbe real to you.\n\nAs a mortal man you have learned to remain awake and become entangled\nwith all the little and big miseries and problems of life, or to goto sleep and\nforget the world. Asa child of God, as a man made in the image of God, you\n\n~must learn (by ecstasy) to cast body consciousness and sleep consciousness in-\n\nto the superconscious ever-new, ever-increasing joy of God. After you can\neasily remain awake or go to sleep, then you must learn to achieve consciously\na state similar to but infinitely more enjoyable than sleep--that is, to go into\necstasy at will with half-open eyes. Don't keep memorizing your mortal habits\nof sleep or wakefulness, but learn to experience the joys of the sleep state con-\nsciously, at will, anytime, anywhere.\n\nLEARN TO GO One cannot sleep so long as he is actively using the body,\n\nTO SLEEP as in running, or so long as he is engrossed in sensory\n\nAT WILL perceptions: smelling, tasting, touching, hearing, or see-\ning. Therefore the first step in going to sleep is to close\n\nthe eyes and cease bodily activity.\n\nTo practice going to sleep, either lie down flat on your back, or sit\nstraight in a comfortable chair with your spine touching the back of the chair.\nTense the body; then quickly relax it. Throw the breath out in a deep exhala-\ntion, \"huh, huh,\" and then forget about breath, whether it remains quiescent\nor continues to flow.\n\n(Forgetting breath is a condition of sleep; while you are asleep you are\nunaware of the breath, as it flows less frequently and more rhythmically. As\nsoon as you awaken you are again conscious of breathing, and you also become\naware of your body and your surroundings. )\n"}

Be indif- @\nferent to sounds or to the feeling of the body; ignore the taste in your mouth @\nand any odors that come to your nostrils. Put sensory and body awareness out\n\nof your mind. Make your mind feel as if you haven't had any sleep for a week\n\nand that you are so drowsy you could drop off instantly, no matter where you\n\nare or what time it is. Dissolve your body consciousness entirely in the sub-\nconscious sleep state. Ordinarily sleep is an involuntary occurrence, but by\npractice the yogi can control his mind and can enter the sleep state anywhere,\nanytime, consciously and at will. Practice until you can go to sleep anywhere,\nanytime, at will.\n\nLEARN TO The next step is to learn to wake at will, after having gone ta\nWAKE sleep at will. Upon awakening thus, open the eyes halfway.\nAT WILL Keep awake by holding them half-open, for about thirty seconds\n\nor so, at first; then close the eyes and try to go to sleep at\nwill once more. When you have become about three-fourths sleepy, open your\neyes halfway and again remain awake for half a minute or so; then close your\neyes and become three-fourths asleep again. Then open your eyes and remain\nawake for a little while.\n\nMake yourself alternately half asleep and half awake, at will, as many\ntimes as youcan. Then practice until you can close your eyes and instantane-\nously sleep soundly for five minutes and, at a mental command, wake yourself\nup and remain awake with half-open eyes for a minute; and then go back to\nsleep. Learn to do the foregoing--sleep and wake alternately many times--\nanywhere, while relaxing in either a quiet or a noisy place.\n\nMAKING THE After mastering the above technique, your mind will\nEVER-WAKEFUL be able to let you sleep fifteen minutes to six hours or\nSUBCONSCIOUS MIND more and wake you up at a definite time. Before you\nWORK FOR YOU go to sleep at night, command your subconscious mind\n\nto wake you up at five or six or at any time you wish,\nand it will do so, When you are ready to goto sleep, suggest to your never-\nsleeping subconscious mind that it wake you at a certain time. You can also\nmake other helpful suggestions to the subconscious mind before sleep. For\nexample, suggest that it get rid of a bad habit. You must make your specific\nwish very intense, and concentrate on it until you fall asleep. Then it will\nwork.\n\nLEARN TO GO INTO (Try this first in a quiet place and then in a noisy\nECSTASY AT WILL place.) Inhale and exhale deeply twelve times.\n\nWith half-open eyes look upward, focusing the gaze\nat the point between the eyebrows. Expel the breath, forgetting it entirely.\nImmediately dissolve body consciousness, thoughts, and feelings of sleepiness,\nif any, into the superconscious, ever-increasing joy of deep inward concentra-\ntion at the spiritual eye. Practice until you can instantaneously, consciously, @\nenjoy and be intoxicated with the bliss-cocktail of many sleeps, whenever you\nturn your gaze within to the spiritual eye.\n\n"}

You\nare not unconscious when you sleep, but semiconscious; when you wake up you\ncan always tell whether you were sleeping lightly or soundly, or in a disturbed\nway or blissfully. The enforced state of soul peacefulness comes to you every\nnight to make you know that you are not just flesh and bones, but a vast, invis-\nible soul, sleeping blissfully in space.\n\nWhy not learn the lesson God gives to you through sleep? God wants you\nto know that you are a happy soul, sleeping in a little nook in space, just as\nHe is the omnipresent Oversoul or manifested Spirit sleeping consciously in\nall space, beyond all material vibrations. By learning to sleep consciously at\nwill, with half-open eyes, you will feel a greater and greater joy or ecstasy\nas the semiconscious awareness of joy felt in the subconscious state of sleep\nis superseded by the conscious awareness of joy felt in the superconscious\nstate of intuitive awareness of the soul. You will gradually learn that you are\none with the Infinite Soul, consciously, quiescently, blissfully sleeping in all\nspace.\n\nDeath is a deeper form of subconscious sleep, and when you wake up from\nit you are not inthe same body, but in some other human form, somewhere\nelse. In ordinary sleep you ''die'' daily, coming back into the same bodily\nhouse when you wake up. Every night you die, every day you are reborn. In\n\n~ one-year alone you-die and-are reborn at least three hundred and- sixty-five\n\ntimes. You wake after sleep because of your desire to fulfill your duties in\nlife. So also, unless you drop all your mortal desires you will actually die\n\nand reincarnate many times in many different forms--until liberation is\n\nreached by working for God and by knowing Him in the temple of meditation,\nno longer impelled by your own rebirth-making mortal desires.\n\nDEFINITE TECHNIQUE As you are falling asleep each night, keep your\nOF ATTAINING ECSTASY _ eyes half-open and focused at the point between\n\nthe eyebrows; consciously enjoy in a relaxed non-\nchalant way the state at the border of joyous sleep as long as you can hold it\nwithout falling asleep, and you will learn to go into ecstasy at will. That\necstasy is a multimillion times more blissful than sleep. Do not use conscious\nnervous will, for then you will be wide awake; rather use passive will to pro-\nlong the enjoyment of the half-awake, half-asleep state every night at bed-\ntime. Try to remain in this state from five minutes to one hour, then you\nwill know about yoga: conscious communion of your soul with God.\n\nSleep is the negative, semiconscious way of uniting soul and God. Ecsta-\nsy Or yoga or conscious communion between soul and God--union of the little\njoy of your soul with the unending joy of omnipresent God--are the same. Ec-\nstasy can be practiced with closed eyes, or with eyes open looking straight\nahead, or looking up at the Christ Consciousness center. But as fully open\neyes suggest wakefulness and closed eyes suggest sleep, so half-open eyes\nsignify the physiological state of the eyes during ecstasy.\n"}

But by\npractice, you will find your eyes naturally focused at the point between the eye-\nbrows. The light of your spiritual eye will help you to keep your eyes half- .\nopen and'half-closed indefinitely during ecstasy. When you practice looking\nat the point between the eyebrows during the state of half-sleep and half-wake- `\nfulness, you will learn to enjoy the state of ecstasy naturally with the half-\nopen eyes without strain. After you master the above state by practicing\nevery night, then anytime, anywhere, when you look at the point between the\neyebrows and think of and feel the joyous state of being half-awake and half-\nasleep, you will be able to go into ecstasy at will. There are various states\nof ecstasy, and by deeper and deeper concentration you will learn the highest\necstasy of feeling the unending, ever new joy of final union of soul and God in\nsabikalpa samadhi (without the consciousness of the universe) or in nirbikalpa\nsamadhi (fully conscious of God and the universe) like seeing the ocean without\nwaves or with waves.

The yogi desir-\ning to go into the superconscious state, or into the fourth dimension (which is\nneither in the state of wakefulness nor in the state of sleep), must concentrate\non the horizon line of the superconsciousness which divides the darkness above\nand the light below, as evidenced when the eyes are thus fixed at the point be-\ntween the two eyebrows (Christ Consciousness center).\n\nPut your finger at the point between the eyebrows; quickly fix your gaze\nthere and feel the state of half-sleep and half-wakefulness and try to enter the\ndivine ecstatic state at once. Practicing at night before sleep will make it\npossible for you to go into ecstasy anytime :\n\nThe light of the spiritual eye is the light reflected from the medulla ob-\nlongata at the base of the brain.

It takes time, years of\npractice, to receive the lost, delusion-paralyzed vision of the spherical spiri-\ntual eye of the soul. The soul as ego, having identified itself with the limited\nvision through the little lens of human eyes, has lost the use of its spherical ,\nspiritual eye, which can look into everything from all sides. One is fortunate\nto behold this omnipresent eye of the soul during meditation. In ecstasy this\neye always remains open in the yogi, and through it he can see into everything,\nabove, beneath, left and right, into all directions of eternity.\n\nFirst learn to go into ecstasy at will with half-open eyes, then the spiri-\ntual eye and its wonders will be revealed to you.

When you want to return to\nbody consciousness, open and close your eyes several times in quick succes-\nsion and keep looking hard at some object without winking.\n\nBy keeping the eyes straight ahead and open without winking, the advanced\nyogi can remain awake several days.

Religion has\neven been peddled with unscientific but profuse advertisements of its efficacy\nby quack spiritual doctors. ''Mine is the only one, the best one, '' is the de-\nclaration of most denominations and cults. But there should be a standard for\njudging what is best, just as the standard of the quality of goods sold there de-\ntermines which store is the best in town, even though all claim to be the best.\n\nWHAT IS THE What is the proper standard for judging the value of any re-\nSTANDARD? ligion? Beliefs, big temples, hymns, and prayers do not\n\nnecessarily signify that a religion is true, good, or lasting.\nBeliefs should be tested by experience; the hives of temples should be filled\nwith the honey of God-realization; hymns should be sung to a Lord whose pres-\nence is truly felt; and prayers made to a God who we know is listening.\n\nThe good that religion has done through the ages, by reminding people of\nan ideal, whether through intuition and reason, or through fear and fanaticism,\ncan never be denied. Yet unscientific religion has also been the cause of the\ntyranny of the caste system and priestcraft in the East, and of the class sys-\ntem, Spanish Inquisition, and burning of martyrs in the West.\n\nUNSCIENTIFIC Cruel wars have been fought in the name of God.

Church funds, instead of being completely tied up in heavy\nmortgages and ornamental edifices, should above all be employed in inducing\nthe greatest scientists of the East and West to make real spiritual investiga-\ntions, testing practical techniques of more quickly developing the physical,\nmental, and spiritual aspects of man toward a state wherein he is perfect,\nharmonious, strong, constant, and happy.

He does\nnot know when he is going to be unhappy, or die without ful-\nfilling his desires.\n\nIn India many scientific principles about truth have been discovered by\nyogis and swamis in religious experimentations; they urge all men to follow\n\"dharma, '' which means \"those immutable principles which protect man per-\nmanently from the threefold suffering of disease, unhappiness, and ignorance. ''\nDestruction of suffering, according to the Hindu Sankhya philosophy, involves\nthe permanent destruction of all possibility of any return of suffering.\n\nThe day when man is able to dematerialize or convert his human body into\nits constituent electrons and basic consciousness, and then materialize it again\ninto an organized living physical being--as Jesus did, and as Hindu yogis do--\nhe will be free, and will suffer no more from collisions with other forms of\nmatter, which result in pain, disease, accident or death.\n\nReligious effort must be applied to the conversion of our consciousness\nfrom its belief in a mortal, perishable body into realization that '\"'solid'' flesh\nis composed of immortal, imperishable energy ''frozen\" into a human form.\nAnd that form is sustained by God's intelligent Cosmic Energy within and\naround us. Hence the scriptures say, ''Man shall not live by bread alone, but\nby every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God (medulla oblongata). ''\n\nPure energy cannot be hurt by automobile accidents, rheumatism, appen-\ndicitis, cancer, or tuberculosis--nor can it be stabbed by swords, shot by\nguns, or burnt by fire. We need practical religion to teach us how to become\naware of ourselves as souls encased in bodies of luminous eternal energy; then\nshall we reclaim the lost image of God in us and attain immortality--and not\nuntil then.\n\nGod made us angels of energy, encased in solids--with the current of life\nshining through the material bulb of flesh--but we are now concentrating upon\nthe frailties and fragility of the bulb, and have forgotten how to feel the immor-\ntal, indestructible properties of the eternal life energy within the changeable\nflesh.

By his suffering, renunciation, and\n\n` “univer sal love Gandhi made many men in different nations feel that they are —\n\nbrothers, and that as brothers they must harmonize their differences. He\n\nsaid that the teachings of Jesus Christ, Krishna, and Tolstoy exercised a great\ninfluence in molding his life; that the Sermon on the Mount, in particular, was\nthe means of leading him to an understanding of Christian teachings. In an\ninterview he made the following statement:\n\n\"My acquaintance with the Christian Bible began nearly forty-five years\nago, and that was through the New Testament. I could not then take much in-\nterest inthe Old Testament, but when I came to the Sermon on the Mount I be-\ngan to understand the Christian teachings. These teachings of Jesus echoed\nsomething I had learned in childhood, something which seemed to me a part of\nmy being which I felt was being acted up to in the daily life around me.\n\n\"This teaching was non-retaliation to evil persons, and resisting evil by\nspiritual force. As my contact with real Christians, that is, men living in the\nfear of God, increased, I saw that the Sermon on the Mount was the whole of\nChristianity for those who wanted to live a Christian life. It is that sermon\nwhich has endeared Jesus to me. I may say that I have never been interested\nin an historical Jesus. I would not care if it were proven by someone that the\nman called Jesus never lived, and that what was narrated in the Gospels was a\nfigment of the writer's imagination, the Sermon on the Mount would still be\ntrue for me.\n\n\"As long as peace remains a hunger still unsatisfied, as long as Christ is\n\n"}

Then we will not think of the birth of Christ as a particular day in the\nyear, but as an ever-recurring event that can be enacted in every life. \"1\n\nIn speaking of ''resistance by love, '' Gandhi said: \"If you have a revolver\nand your powerful enemy has another, and youflee, saying: 'I forgive him'\nthen you are a coward.'' He said also that it is better to use the gun than to\nbe a coward, but he advised the use of a superior weapon--instead of either\nrunning away or shooting--when confronted by an armed enemy who has done\nwrong. This superior weapon is \"resistance by love and non-cooperation\nwith the enemy's evil ways. '\n\nPractice of this will make you a real, victorious, spiritual man. If God\nwith all His miraculous power punished man, where would man be? God does\nnot use crude material force to influence us, but the self-reforming power of\nlove.

Thou\nart the finite symbol of Infinity. Make me aware of\nthis always!\n\n(>.\nTHE INNER MEANING OF SYMBOLS\n\nAll true symbols represent some vast perception of God. That is why we\nshould understand the symbolism of both Eastern and Western religions. Since\neach symbol represents some great truth, when we become attached to a sym-\nbol without understanding the truth behind it our concentration on that symbol\nbecomes idol worship, which leads to superstition and dogmatic teaching. The\nworship of symbols exemplifies a primitive state of understanding. The whole\nuniverse consists of symbols that have to be studied and understood by man.\nThe physical cosmos with its elliptical solar systems, blue skies, and count-\nless stars constitutes the finite symbol or \"body\"! of the Infinite. The cosmos\nhas a finite manifested side and an unmanifested region. This unmanifested\nregion is the \"invisible mind\" of God, working in the finite 'brain'' of the man-\nifested, finite region of cosmic creation. In the manifested cosmos, space can\nbe spoken of as the \"body\" of God. The ''skin'' of the Cosmic Idol is blue and\norange. Through every pore of blue space God is breathing life.\n\nSYMBOL OF First of all, we must distinguish between true religion and\nTHE CROSS religious superstition. Everywhere we find that true religion\n\nhas slipped away more or less from real religious practices.\nEvery symbolical ceremony represents certain religious principles, but the\npractice of religious rites, forgetting the principles for which they stand, leads\nto idolatry. For instance, if you worship the cross and polish it every day and\nlove it, forgetting the main thing for which the cross stands, that is idol worship.\nBut if you carry the cross and it reminds you of the suffering of Jesus on the\nCross and that he said of his persecutors: ''Father, forgive them, for they know\nnot what they do, '' then you are using that symbol in the right way.\n\nThe cross is a symbol of man as a combination of duality, as the conscious-\nness between the Infinite and the finite. The horizontal line represents the\nfinite world, or nature, and the vertical line represents the Infinite; when these\nlines are crossed they symbolize the cross between nature and Spirit. We are\nthe product of both the finite and the Infinite. The Cross was made famous\nbecause Jesus was hung upon it, but it symbolizes to Christians his triumph\nover death. But the cross symbol really signifies a combination of the finite\nand the Infinite.\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 1211, "text": "S-6 P-156 3\n\nSYMBOL OF The symbol of the triangle means \"God the Father, the Son,\n@ THE TRIANGLE and the Holy Ghost.'' The triangle also represents the three\ngunas --the good, evil, and activating qualities that make up\nman's character. All the life currents have to have three qualities to create\nour physical body. When our existence becomes pure, free of the gunas, then\nwe are in Spirit.\n\nSYMBOL OF THE The spiritual eye is the symbol of life. It is the epitome\nSPIRITUAL EYE of all the cosmic energy in the universe. The entire cos-\n\nmos appears as the blue light of Christ Consciousness,\nand around this blue light, the golden halo of cosmic energy, and in the center\nof the blue light a little silvery star, which represents Spirit. First, Spirit was\nthe little star; then it vibrated, and that intelligent vibration became the blue\nlight of Christ Consciousness, which is present in all finite creation; and finally\nit manifests as the golden light of astral energy.\n\nThe central part, or core, of this earth is very, very hot, whereas its outer\nsurface is much cooler. The energy is centralized in the center. Likewise, the\ncentral part of the spiritual eye is the most powerful. The symbol of the spiri-\ntual eye is very important. Everything that has been made was made after the\npattern of the spiritual eye. In every atom, in every electron, there are three\nparts, or layers. We do not know what is inside the very central core. But if\nwe could explore the heart of everything, we would know God.\n\n@ The sun is the symbol of the spiritual eye. As the sun is the life of the cos-\nmos; so the spiritual eye is the life of man's body. Behind the light of the sun\nis the Cosmic Energy. Behind the light of the spiritual eye is Cosmic Energy.\nThe sun will burn the retina of your physical eyes, but seeing the spiritual eye\nwon't burn you, though it is brighter than a million suns. All the light of this\nworld is only darkness compared to what we can see and realize through the\nspiritual eye.\n\nLINES AND Why do we like straight lines, and circles, and all round things?\nCIRCLES The horizon, the earth, and the ocean are all round. Our body\nis made after this pattern. The head, the eyes, the fingers,\nthe lungs, the ears, and other parts of the body are all round. Every straight\nline, when put in all directions becomes round. The straight line is more crea-\ntive because it has both a positive and a negative pole, and when you elongate\nboth ends, it becomes eternal. The symbol of the Infinite is the straight line\nand the sphere. The symbol of earth and other planets is round. Why? Because\nforce, when it scintillates itself from a central point, always takes an even radi-\nus and creates a sphere. So the symbol of roundness is a real symbol; and from\nthis, crystal worship originated.\n\nThe first vibration from God was a sphere with a central nucleus. That is\n© the meaning of the round symbol on tops of temples in India. Eternity is also\nthought of as a sphere. You go round and round and you do not find the end.\n\n"}

The project-\ning force creates finite forms and the attracting force withdraws them into the @\nInfinite.\n\nSYMBOL OF Every symbol in nature is a materialization of the rays of\nTHE INFINITE God. We are not simple in make-up. Man is a condensed\n\nconglomeration of molecular solar systems, of electronic\nand protonic systems. It is relativity that makes us feel small. The earth is\ntiny in comparison to the sun, and we are small in comparison to the earth.\nSolar systems upon solar systems are moving about in the ether. Wearea\ndream within a dream. The body belongs to the earth, which is a part of the\nsolar system, and the solar system belongs to the cosmic system. So although\nwe are different in appearance, we are all symbols of the Infinite, of that vast\nforce of God.\n\nSYMBOL Mountains, oceans, volcanoes, trees--all have been trying to get\nOF RAYS away from the limitations of their earth existence, and the highest\n\nattempt is found in the man of realization. In such a man the\nlocked-up body rays find freedom in Omnipresence.:\n\nEach flower is a symbol of the Infinite trying to express Itself. Fragrances\nare luminous rays of Omnipresence. Everything is trying to get out of the bond-\nage of finite matter. The fragrance of the flowers and the expanding thoughts of\nmen are all attempts of the locked-up life force in matter to find its home in\nOmnipresence.\n\nThe symbol of a tree, the symbol of an animal--both represent different\nforms of'life. Earth is a symbol representing the first stage of evolution in\nfinite creation. The nebulae as a symbol represent a mass of vapors. The\nemergence of nature, stones, metals, and so forth, are the first symbols of\nGod's beauty expressed in crude earth. Metals and stones are all symbols of\nbeauty and power; gems symbolize not only beauty and power but healing force\nas well. The tree was the first symbol of life, signifying its first emergence out\nof matter; therefore, the tree symbol is spoken of as the \"'tree of life''--a nervous\nsystem projected out of matter.\n\nThe spirit of God wants to come out of the earth symbol. So Spirit becomes\nthe gems and the stones, and then it becomes the trees and plant life. The roots\nrepresent the inner condensed rays projecting out of the universal rays of cosmic\nenergy. The branches represent the condensed outer rays emanating from the\ninner rays. Inthe animal and human nervous system the condensed rays of the\nnervous system become apparently free from cosmic energy. Man's outer\nnervous system was created out of the soul's desire to free itself from the bond-\nage of the cells, and to be released in Omnipresence. The outer nervous system\nof man keeps the soul busy with the limitations of matter. The superman with-\ndraws all rays from the nervous system and floats them through the spine and | ।\nlets them out through the medulla oblongata into the infinite sphere of Light.\n\nKH\n\n"}

Saint Maduski's friends repeatedly\nwarned him not to risk his life by venturing a flight through the turbulent heavens\nin the face of an approaching storm. Maduski himself had a premonition that he\nwould come across some kind of trouble if he carried out his determination to\nattend the conference, upon which depended the welfare of many nations. He\ndebated in his mind, repeating to himself: ''God is the essence of all goodness,\nand since my purpose is good, I ought to surmount all difficulties that I may\nmeet with during my flight to Geneva. \"'\n\nThen again he reflected: ''But there are so many people with good intentions\nwho have performed good deeds but who have met with disaster during their\neffort to do good; God apparently did not protect them. And there are some peo-\nple who are treacherous and sinful but who apparently have continued to wander\nfreely along the pathway of life without being punished by God's laws.\"\n\nFinally, however, Saint Maduski's sunny faith in God reappeared, brilliantly\nshining from beneath the dark clouds of doubts. His wife, his friends, and his\nneighbors came to protest his venturing through the menacing skies, but their\nremonstrations were of no avail.

Then he heaved a sigh of relief, thinking\nthat his faith had won and God had smiled upon his destiny to protect him. But\nin a few minutes his joy turned into dismay as he heard and dimly saw a big rat\ngnawing at one of the vital electric wires that controlled the entire mechanism\nof his monoplane. No matter how he twisted the plane in its course, the big rat\nwent on with his nefarious work. Saint Maduski could not reach the creature,\nyet he realized that if he let the rat's sharp teeth continue to chew the wire, he\nwould have a short circuit; and that meant he would encounter the danger of a\nforced landing and crashing on the mountain over which he was flying.\n\nIn desperation, he tried to seek a solution, and at last received an inspira-\ntion from within. Shooting his plane upward from 10,000 to 20,000 feet, he kept\ngoing higher and higher into the region of the stratosphere, until he could see\nthat the rat had become powerless and had expired, unable to stand the rarefied\natmosphere in which the plane was now moving. Much relieved and happy, know-\ning that God had answered his prayer, Saint Maduski went on his way rejoicing,\nfinally reaching Geneva safely to accomplish his task.\n\n"}

But has he gone just\nlike other people who cannot be approached after death? No. He ever lives.\nWhy don't you know him? Because you do not know the way by which you can\nbring him into your perception. To spiritual people Jesus is ever living.\nYou must understand who Jesus Christ was and why he came on earth. You\nmust know how to contact him.\n\nFrom time to time, throughout the annals of history, we find God mani-\nfesting Himself through the consciousness of saints and great reformer proph-\nets of God. God may reflect Himself through one person or through many,\nbut He does not become wholly manifest in any one person. A Christ is known\nby his actions. There are two kinds of saints--those who do qualitative good,\nand those who do quantitative good. To do qualitative good is to liberate\nanother soul completely. The greatness or spiritual development of liberated\nsouls, or saints, cannot be compared, for when they are liberated, they are\nall equal.\n\nGod sent souls on earth and as they manifest different degrees of con-\nsciousness they may be said to be greater, or higher, or lower. We were all\ncreated equal, but according to the kind of lives we have lived we have created\nthese different degrees of consciousness. Jesus, at the end of his life, was\nable to reflect perfectly his true soul nature as the image of God. He had\nrisen completely from all earthly ties and desires after three days in the\ntomb.\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN (72 Jesus the man fully reflected the Christ\n\"JESUS' AND \"CHRIST\"!

His consciousness was expanded into Christ\nConsciousness.\n\nThe ordinary consciousness of Jesus the man was bound by his body occu-\n‘pying a little speck of vibratory region on the earth. But in the Holy Ghost\nstate, in oneness with the Cosmic Vibration of Om, the consciousness of Jesus\nexpanded from the small territory of the body to all vibratory regions of crea-\ntion.

You must know that Christ is, was, and shall be hereafter.\nHow are you going to know? Different degrees of Christ Consciousness lead\nyou to that goal. Free souls like Jesus are incarnations of God.\n\nTo gain Self-realization you must acquire through meditation now every-\nthing that you expect to have hereafter. The only way you can be happy is to\nbring Christ into your consciousness now. You must meditate deeply. Books\nand sermons may inspire you to want to know Christ, but they cannot bring\nChrist into your life. That only comes through meditation. In the time of\nJesus thousands of people saw him but did not know him as a Christ. Only\nthose who are highly developed can know Carist. You can only know Christ by\nmeditating in the right way. Then, when your mind begins to expand, you will\nfeel his presence.\n\nIf you know Christ in meditation by expanding your consciousness, you\nwill realize that you are a Christ on earth. You will live that life and enjoy\nthat life and be able to help others who are making their lives miserable by for-\ngetting Him. You will show them that there is nothing to be afraid of. You are\nimmortal children of God. That is what meditation will do for you. Meditate!\nFollow these methods! While you are willing and able, do not wait! Iurge you\nbecause I desire to help you. I want to bring God and Christ into your life.\n\nThe more you meditate, the more transparent will your mind become. God\ncannot reflect through those who do not commune with Him. Jesus reflected\nHim because he was highly developed. You must develop that mental transpar-\naa. also. The sun can be brightly reflected by a mirror, but not by a dark\nglass. Similarly, in your ordinary consciousness Christ cannot come. You\nhave to expand your consciousness. Many who helped to bring about the death\nof Jesus did not know whohe was. They only knew Jesus the man, not Jesus\nthe Christ. Even today many who think of themselves as Christians do not\nfully know Christ. One who may think himself a Christian, may not be accept-\ned by Christ when he goes beyond. God is the knower of all. He is the knower\nof our souls. It is He who judges through our actions what we are to be. Again\nI say--meditate! Your heart will burst with joy and you will remember God\nagain.

He brooked no resistance to his\ntyrannical will; anyone who displeased him, whether it was one of his own pol-\nitical servants or a helpless visitor, was sure to meet his doom.\n\nThere also lived at this time in India a great saint named Teghbahadur,\nwho was known far and wide because of numerous miracles he had performed\nat the direction of the divine Spirit. Many physically afflicted persons re-\nceived instantaneous healing, and souls steeped in the darkness of spiritual\nignorance beheld the all-freeing Light through contact with this great saint.\n\nStories and testimonials about Saint Teghbahadur's healing power perco-\nlated throughout India, until finally they reached the emperor's curious ears.\nThe emperor sent for him. When Saint Teghbahadur arrived, the emperor\nsaid: \"People are raving about your so-called miraculous powers. If you are\na saint, Icommand you to demonstrate some miracles in my presence. Other-\nwise you will have to die. \"'!\n\nBut Teghbahadur, who was guided solely by divine will, did not feel dis-\nposed to cheapen his divine powers by uselessly displaying them; he maintained\nsilence. Repeatedly, with unreasonable insistence, the emperor pressed the\nsaint to perform some miracle, but to no avail. The adamantine silence of\n\n"}

He seized his sword and, | ।\nbrandishing it, declared: 'No one stands against my will. Be assured that this\nunsheathed sword of mine will sever your head from your body if you do not\n\nsatisfy my desire for a miracle.\"\n\nGently but firmly, Saint Teghbahadur spoke at last: ''Swiftly sever my\nhead, curious king! Not before that will your lust for miracles be satisfied.\nThis I will do in order to cure you of your wicked nature. But meanwhile I\ndefy your will; not until you have slain me will you behold a miracle. This su-\npreme sacrifice of my body I will perform in order to heal your ignorance.\n\nMy miracle will satisfy your curiosity about the presence and miraculous pow-\ner of God. Be quick! Let your sword sever the head from my mortal body.\"\n\nCarried away with impatience at the saint's continued defiance, the emper-\nor wrathfully swung his sword through the neck of Saint Teghbahadur. ` Holding\nthe blood-dripping blade, the emperor stood aghast, nearly frozen with fear,\nas he beheld what followed. For Saint Teghbahadur truly kept his word. His\nsevered head began to dance around the king's feet, on the marble floor of the\npalace, and without the help of the lungs or any other part of the body, it began\nto speak loudly, at the same time writing in blood on the floor: \"Cruel emper-\nor, Ihave given you my head, but not the secret of my religion. Even though\nyou have severed my head, I can still talk, fa Iam alive evermore in Spirit. ''\n\nGreat masters who are in tune with the Infinite, as Jesus Christ was, will\nreadily give up their lives rather than act contrary to a divine principle. No\ndevotee of God ever plans to do anything against the will of the Divine Father.\nAs God with His infinite miraculous powers does not impose upon the free will\nof His human children by using miracles to demonstrate His presence, so does\nHe expect all His devotees to behave with equal restraint. By a display of His\npowers God could easily frighten man into mechanical submission to His will,\nbut this is farthest from the Divine Father's wish. Instead, He lays before the\neyes of His children the whole miraculous panorama of the universe, and He\nexpects them to use His gifts of wisdom, love, and free will to seek Him, and\nto love Him.\n\nThus a true devotee of God never displays divine miracles when challenged\nby ignorant people, as we have just seen in the life of Saint Teghbahadur.\nJesus also refused to give signs to prove his divinity to those who challenged\nhim with a wrong attitude. He only demonstrated his miracles, even resurrec-\ntion, under divine sanction in a unique, divine way, to increase the faith of\nthose who are real spiritual seekers.\n\naK\n\n"}

Certain ones may fail to see the purpose and object of our work.\nOthers may not appreciate the efforts we have put forth to please all. We must\ntherefore place ourselves above the likes and dislikes of people and go on doing\nour work, leaving no stones unturned in our effort to bring about success. We\nshould not seek refuge in inaction, thinking ''Of what avail are these painful\nworks if their fruits be not desired?'' Nor should we be fatalists, believing\nthat what is to be will be, whether we put forth our. best efforts to bring it about\nor not. Nor should we expect to be successful in all our attempts. Some ven-\ntures may fail, but others will be successful. Success and failure are inter-\nrelated; one cannot exist without the other. Life would not be pleasant if we\nhad either success or failure all the time. So we should not become egotisti-\ncal and overpowered with pride if we find abundant success; nor should we lose\nheart and become discouraged if we meet with failure. We must cultivate\nstrength and will power, so that we will not be overwhelmed by failure. We\nshould approach our nearest problem or duty with concentrated energy and exe-\ncute it to perfection. This should be our philosophy of life.\n\nKeep away from trivialities, and instead stock your mind with knowledge\nthat is worthwhile. Often men who are absorbed in business show sucha rare\nquality of culture that we are surprised by it. The reason is that there is no\nroom in such lives for inferior mental occupation. Concentration on great\nbooks, great men, great problems, great doctrines, and great facts and their\nlessons cannot but result in high thinking. The busier we are, the more severe\nshould be our selection of mental fare. Facts are only material for thought.\nThe thoughts themselves--that is to say, the illumination produced in our minds\nby the presence of rich facts--should be preserved even more carefully. Edu-\ncated people look for the relation between ideas or between facts, and never\nsee anything without visualizing another idea or fact which relates to or is be-\nhind it. To keep no account of what one learns or thinks is as foolish as it\nwould be to till and seed one's land with great pains and, when the harvest is\nripe, turn one's back upon it and think of it no longer. Decide to develop the\ncapacity to have your own opinion about an idea, a poem, doctrine, or a work\nof art, and see it clearly enough to give it forcible expression. Comprehension\nis criticism, and criticism or judgment is a synonym for thought.\n\n"}

His parents had both died when he was very young,\nleaving him wholly dependent on the grandmother's care. She was so greatly\nattached to him that she tried to fulfill his every desire. Being so blinded by\nher love for the grandson, she thought he was perfect and could do no wrong,\neven when he misbehaved.\n\nAfter a while the little boy began to attend the village school. He was so\nmischievous that in a short time the whole school was astir with the exploits\nof this naughty little pet. The teachers wrote to the grandmother in regard to\nher grandson's demoralizing conduct, but she turned a deaf ear to the com-\nplaints of the teachers and scolded them for finding fault with her boy--so pure\nin her estimation!\n\nUnder the protection of the grandmother's approval of everything he did,\nthe boy grew worse and worse and finally turned from playing pranks and per-\nforming other trivial misdemeanors, into perpetrating offenses of deeper\ngravity. After imitating other boys in the use of profane language, and so\nforth, the boy started stealing different articles from his school mates. One\nday he stole a costly fountain pen from a classmate. He hurriedly got away\nfrom the school and raced for the welcoming arms of his grandmother. She\nbegan to shower him with kisses and embraces; he could scarcely get her\nattention, so great was the impetuosity of her affection.\n\nAt last, when grandmother's effusion of affectionate words ceased, the\nboy said: \"Grandmother, I tried to tell you, but you would not let me, that I\nwanted a fountain pen and so, cleverly and unnoticed, I picked one from my\n\nclassmate's pocket.'' The grandmother just gave the remorseful grandson a\ngreat big hug and said: ''You must have wanted it very much, and so I cannot\nscold you for taking it.'' The grandson was extremely astonished that he re-\n\nceived caresses instead of the expected and well-deserved scolding. Encour-\naged, the boy started stealing books, pens, and other valuables from his\n\n"}

The grandmother's intentions\nwere all right, but due to her erroneous methods, the boy, as he grew older,\ndeveloped into a professional thief. When he grew to manhood, he became a\nfull-fledged criminal and joined a crime syndicate, scientifically planning and\nworking out many crimes. The neighbors began to find their cattle and chickens\nmissing, and other neighboring villagers began to lose their silverware and\nother valuable articles from their homes. There was a great commotion, and\nvigilantes were appointed to apprehend the thief. The grandson, now an expert\nthief, became bolder and bolder because he was able to elude detection.\n\nAs no one can forever hide his wrongdoing, and no one can fool all the peo-\nple all the time, the criminal ran into a trap laid for him by the outraged vil-\nlagers. He was flogged by the angry villagers and remanded to jail. There\nwas a hasty hearing and all the rich grandmother's attempts to save him failed.\nHer wicked grandson was sentenced to ten years of rigorous imprisonment for\nhis confessed crimes of about forty thefts.\n\nBut as the grandson was being led to jail, he made a last request that he\nwanted to whisper a secret in his grandmother's ear. The grandmother, being\n\n——€alled, ¢amé to her grandson in sorrowful tears, and stcoped down and placed\nher right ear in front of her grandson's mouth. No sooner was this done than\nthe grandson sprang upward like a mastiff and held the right ear of his howling\ngrandmother in between his clenched sawlike teeth. After many punches and\nkicks from the policemen, the grandson at last let go of his grandmother,\nन्न biting off a piece of her ear. As the grandmother cursed and wailed, the\ngrandson triumphantly, with great satisfaction in his eyes, cried out: ''Remem-\nber, if you had scolded me when I stole the first fountain pen, today I would\n\nnot have to go to jail and serve ten years at hard labor.\"\n\nThe moral is: it is not only bad for you personally to do evil, but it is\nextremely pernicious for you to tolerate evil in your dear ones by sanctioning\ntheir evil deeds. Evil actions attract evil consequences.

The human soul also is imbued with the divine power of attraction.\n\nTo create the finite cosmos, God exerted an opposing force of repulsion:\ndualities such as heat and cold, and multifarious finite beings and objects He\ncreated by sending forth vibratory forces from within His own Being. The\nideational vibratory force emanating from the Infinite, materialized first into\ncosmic energy which, in turn, materialized into matter, to create the finite\nuniverse.\n\nOriginally the universal creative force rested, or remained quiescent, in\nthe bosom of Spirit. But upon being cast out (i.e., projected) from Spirit, it\nacted as a conscious independent force, capable of creating delusive finite dual-\nities contrary to the single pattern of the one universal Spirit. As God is con- | ।\nscious, the creative force that went out of Him also is conscious.\n\nSATANIC FORCE The creative force that went forth from Spirit to fashion\n\nthe universe is spoken of as Satan, in the Christian\nscriptures. It is said that Satan ''fell from heaven\"; that is, the satanic force\nor universal energy was expelled, like outgoing lightning, from the bosom of\nCosmic Spirit. The Cosmic Delusion or Satan is the originator of all finite\nbeings and objects, and in this sense is the creator of evil--the delusion of\nfiniteness and mortality that keeps finite creatures ignorant of their original\noneness with God.\n\nSatan is impersonally described in the Hindu scriptures as Maya or Illu-\nsion. In projecting creation God is said to have given all power over the uni-\nverses to Maya; Maya or Satan is said to be ''independent'' in the sense that\nGod per se cannot be connected with or reflected in anything limited, mortal,\ncreated, or subject to growth and decay. Such things are contrary to God's\nnature. Anything that is finite is opposed to God the Infinite; in this sense\nMaya is the devil or evil. ''The devil....was a murderer from the beginning,\nand abode not in the truth, because there is notruth in him. When he speak-\neth a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of 10\" (John\n8:44).\n\nBut Spirit by Its very nature exerts Its own universal attractive force and @\n\n"}

Satan desires that creation and all its inhabitants\ncontinuously reincarnate--and thus remain in the finite state--separated from\nSpirit. Hence Satan encourages in all beings slavery to instinct, conscious\nand unconscious desires for finite experience, and material attachments. If\nSpirit had not given consciousness and independence to the universal repulsive\npower called Satan, all human beings and inanimate objects would, after a cer-\ntain period of finite existence, lose the cohesive creative power engendered\nand maintained by delusive attachment to confining physical forms and experi-\nences, and evaporate into their original state of Infinitude.\n\nHowever, to perpetuate His 11197\" or play of creation, Spirit made the uni-\nversal satanic force conscious and \"independent. '' As a result, Satan is able\nto keep everything and everybody deluded with the unspiritual consciousness of\nfiniteness and separateness for many, many incarnations. That is why even\ninanimate objects go through a process of evolution. Souls reincarnate through\nthe law of cause and effect, which is operated by the power of desire born of\nthe contact with finite matter. The satanic repulsive force is thus said to keep\nup a steady fight with Spirit, whose emancipating attractive force constantly\n~@ -tries to.call back all separately created beings and objects, to dissolve incon-e _ ._ _... __\nscious, blissful Unity.\n\nThough God is ever trying to recall His children to Himself, the trouble\nis, they become truants from Him, lured by the delusive satanic force to con-\ntinue reincarnating and going through dualistic earthly experiences. Medita-\ntion is the only way to escape the clutches of universal delusion and go back to\nGod. It is the conscious way of going into the Infinite, where limiting concepts\nof race, religion, family, fame, name, possessions--all that belongs to the\ndelusive little finite body and its finite world--are forgotten.\n\nThe human soul is made in the image of God, but the body in which it is\nencased is partially created and maintained by the finite-creating power of the\nsatanic repulsive force. God had a divine purpose in creation, and in giving\nMaya or illusion independent power to perpetuate itself, and to form objects\njust as it pleases, even though they be contrary to the perfect pattern intended\nby God. Man too has freedom to create a perfect or an imperfect life. Hence\neach individual life is a scene of tug-of-war between God's indrawing attractive\nmagnetism and Satan's outgoing repulsive magnetism. Man's mind and senses\nare attracted to finite matter; his discrimination and intuition are attracted to\nsoul-pleasing actions and Spirit. The soul, by the power of discrimination and\nintuition, tries to pull to itself, and to put into harmonious actions, all unify-\ning noble bodily and mental forces. The satanic force inspires desires that\n\n@ keep the body away from the influence of divine soul-magnetism, and influences\n\n"}

By it the soul attracts all good-reminding\nhuman experiences. It is by soul magnetism that an individual draws to him-\nself friends and the objects of desires that are basically important to him; and\nacquires the power to know everything about everything. This soul attraction\n\nis God's universally distributed magnetic power, which is seated in every heart.\n\nUNIVERSAL MAGNETISM Because Spirit is in everything, has in Itself\n\nthis drawing power, all things created out of\nSpirit have something of Its nature and Its drawing power, in an individualized\nstate. Tinus the sun keeps the planets tied to itself by rays of magnetism, and\nthe nucleus of an atom magnetically holds the tiny constituent particles of the\natom together.

Manisa rational, moral, aesthetic, spiritual ani-\nmal, and each of these qualities possesses its own particular magnetism. By\nanimal magnetism a man draws to himself physically-minded people. It is al-\nmost hypnotic in its effect. Often the exchange of animal magnetism between\nyoung people of opposite sexes living on the material plane awakens blinding\nemotions and passions; thus they draw to themselves all kinds of destructive\nevil habits.\n\nANIMAL MAGNETISM Hypnosis is a crime in the sense that the hypnotizer\nAND HYPNOSIS robs his subject of free will, judgment, and con-\n\nsciousness. Hypnosis practiced repeatedly on a\nsubject for any length of time may affect his brain and make his mind mechani-\ncal, guided automatically by enslaving suggestions. Never allow yourself to be\nunder the influence of any one's animal magnetism, which is a semi-hypnotic\npower. There is only a shade of difference between animal magnetism and\nhypnosis. When an individual exercises his animal magnetism on another per-\nson, the influenced one is constantly blinded and prejudiced by the wrong or\nright judgment of the stronger personality.\n\nA person under the influence of another's animal magnetism may perform\nactions consciously, apparently not under any hypnotic influence, yet his con-\nsciousness is nevertheless secretly guided and prejudiced by the other person's\ninstincts and habits.\n\nOne who is under the influence of hypnosis, on the other hand, becomes\nunconscious of his surroundings, and is instead aware only of the suggestions\nof the hypnotizer. A hypnotized person is guided by his subconscious mind,\n\n"}

In allowing himself\n\n[ to be hypnotized, he permits the trespass of another into the territory of his\nconsciousness. This is why no one should want to be influenced by animal\nmagnetism or to be hypnotized. Repeated subjection of the mind to the hypnotic\nstate brings a negative psychological effect that in time deranges the brain cells.\n\nILLUSTRATION OF The ordinary horseshoe magnet has two poles--posi-\nHORSESHOE MAGNET tive and negative--as well as a neutral area.\n\nThrough its positive-negative hands, the magnet\ndraws to itself pieces of iron within a certain range. Furthermore, when a\nmagnet is rubbed on a piece of nonmagnetic iron, the iron becomes magnetic.\nLikewise, another person's magnetism can be absorbed by close association\nand loving respectful attention. But if you wish to develop magnetism by this\nmeans, you should first make up your mind what kind of magnetism you want.\nThe next thing is to choose the type of magnetic person from whom the specific\nmagnetism that you need is to be acquired. If you think that you are a failure\n= you want the magnetism of business success, you should try to associate\nclosely with successful businessmen; seek opportunities to shake hands with\nthem and mingle with them.\n\nIn hand-shaking two magnets are formed. The upper spiritual magnet is\nformed with two heads as the two poles, and the lower magnet is formed with\nthe two pairs of feet as the two poles.

Make us unmarred, bright mirrors, reflecting Thee.\n\n1.\n\nTHE THIRD EYE, OR COSMIC MIRROR\n\nThe harmonization of the neuter, positive, and negative qualities is spo-\nken of as Prakriti (Cosmic Nature). By the differentiation of these three\nqualities--spiritual, activating, and obstructing (or sattvic, rajasic, andtam-\nasic)--this Cosmos is created. These three qualities are found in varying\nproportions in the five elemental vibrations of earth, water, fire, air, and\nether. Through the instrumentality of these five vibrations, a mortal being\nenjoys the qualities of matter. If he knows their real nature and knows how\nto act wisely with them, he will find ultimate freedom.\n\nThe good sattvic quality expresses calmness; the dark tamasic quality in-\nertia and lethargy; and the activating rajasic quality, being impregnated with\nmobility, expresses itself variously, activating good or evil. The devotee,\nthrough the calmness of meditation, feels at the Christ or Krishna center (the\nall-perceiving consciousness at the point between the eyebrows) the presence\nof the five vibrations that direct human nature.\n\nA material mirror reflects only material objects, but cannot reflect the\nmind or intelligence as the body does. The Hindu scriptures also speak of the\nbody as a place of pilgrimage and an abode for all the gods and demons of good\nand evil qualities. The body is the epitome of all knowledge. In it, at the\nChrist Consciousness center, is the ideal introspective mirror. Herein all\nthe physical, subtle, and astral qualities and vibrations of nature are perceived.\n\nThrough this magic mirror of the third eye, hidden in the forehead, man\nmay behold Spirit and all the subtle and gross forces of creation. In this mir-\nror the past, present, and future destiny of all peoples and the cosmos are in-\nfallibly shown. When one's spiritual eye is open and when one's soul can look\ninto this inner mirror, one need not depend upon the limited knowledge of\nastrology, or other predictive arts, to learn about oneself, or about one's\nfuture.\n\nThe great scripture writers, knowing that the study of books could never\ndirectly produce ultimate knowledge, followed the path of self-discipline and\nthe knowledge gained by peering through the inner eye.

When by medita-\nAND VIBRATIONS tion the devotee opens one of the five spiritual centers\nDESCRIBED or plexuses, he experiences definite changes in his\n\nbreath flow, breath length, and breath direction, which\nindicate exactly what center has been opened by his meditation. Each of the\nspiritual centers also has a characteristic color, taste, and form. Thus, by\nknowledge of changes in breath flow and by experiencing definite colors, tastes,\nand forms in meditation, the devotee knows which center he has succeeded in\ncontacting.\n\nWhen the earth vibration in the coccygeal plexus is manifest in meditation,\nthen, untouched by either end of the nostrils, the breath flows through the ex-\nact middle of the nasal passages for about thirty inches--from the lungs to the\npoint outside the body where a breath ends. Sweet juice is tasted in the throat\nand attachment to sweet juices accrues. The mind perceives yellow colors\nand becomes attached to these colors. Inthe Christ Consciousness or Krishna\ncenter, a yellow figure with four angles is perceived. When the mind of the\nperceiving devotee is pure, the above experience of the earth vibration re-\nmains for twenty minutes.\n\nDuring the perception of the water vibration in the sacral plexus (reflected\nin the Christ Consciousness center) the breath flows through the base of the\nnostrils, and the length of its course is about ten inches. A mildly bitter taste\nis then experienced in the throat and attachment to sucha taste grows. The\nmind perceives the color of white, and the desire to see the color grows. In\nthe Christ Consciousness center, at the point between the eyebrows, one sees\na white half-moon. One of purified mind perceives the water vibration for\nsixteen minutes.\n\nDuring the manifestation of the fire vibration in the lumbar plexus, the\nbreath flows through the upper part of the nostrils, and its course is up to ten\ninches in length. A bitter taste is experienced in the throat and attachment to\na bitter taste grows. The mind perceives a blood-red color and becomes at-\ntached to blood-red colors. Inthe Christ Consciousness center, at the point\nbetween the eyebrows, one perceives a blood-red triangular figure. If the\ndevotee's mind is purified, this fire vibratory state lasts for twelve minutes.\n\nDuring the sojourn of the air element, or life force, in the dorsal plexus,\nthe breath flows through the sides of the nostrils and its course is up to twenty\ninches in length. A sour taste is experienced in the throat and the desire for\na sour taste grows. The mind perceives a blue color, and a desire for blue\ngrows. Inthe Christ Consciousness center, a round ball of palpitating blue is\nperceived. The devotee whose mind has been purified perceives this vibration\nof life force for eight minutes.\n\n"}

God's inner spiritual nature is perfect, ever-existing, ever-\nconscious, ever-new Bliss, whereas His outward nature, as reflected in Cos-\nmic Nature and delusion (maya), appears to be full of imperfection. God is\nperfect. All nature is imperfect.\n\nAs human beings, we constantly watch the war between the hidden perfec-\ntion of God in nature (Para-Prakriti) and the delusion-created apparent imper-\nfection in nature (Apara-Prakriti). Nature is wonderful, but nevertheless it is\nfull of contradictions. It looks as if the hidden perfection is trying to express\nitself through imperfect nature.\n\nWhen the breeze ceases to flow over the pool, then the image of the re-\nflected moon in it assumes its natural undistorted face. Likewise, when the\nstorm of delusion is removed from the ocean of mind by meditation, then the\nnatural undistorted image of God reflected in it is perceptible to the meditat-\ning devotee.\n\nTo the average mind comes the eternal question: If God is perfect, why is\nit that Cosmic Nature, emanating from Him, appears to be imperfect? The\nanswer lies in the fact that, as the reflected moon in a breeze-stirred pool is\ndistorted only in appearance but not in reality, so the perfect God, mirrored\nin delusive nature, appears to manifest the delusion of imperfection. In real-\nity God is ever perfect, both in His unmanifested state (when the cosmos was\nnot created) and in His manifested state (after creation).\n\nThe advanced devotee does not concentrate upon the delusive contradictory\nimperfect state of nature, but keeps his attention focused upon the perfect\nnature of God.

I closed the doors of my eyes. Then again I was confronted\nwith the same abysmal darkness. I watched with steady vision, looking and\nseeking in all directions. Sometimes bewildered, I felt that I caught glimpses\nof opaque thought, which became half visible in that deep mystic chamber.\n\nI steadily watched in the dim but growing light of my concentration. The\ngloom became softer and revealed its hidden glory. I found that I could see\nwithout my eyes; see each glimmering thought, like dream lightning, flash and\ndisappear or come bursting like star shells, with revealing showers of light,\nand vanish in the mental sky. I could count each flash, each outburst, and\ncould recognize their intensity, their duration, and their meaningful splendors.\n\nI found that I could hear without my ears the muffled chafing roars of loud\npowerful thoughts, softer sweet suggestions of conscience, and the quiet voice\nof reason. I heard distinctly all they said, as I had never heard before.\n\nThus, for the first time, I felt the presence of these living inner invisible\nblood relatives. These, my own, had long lived so near in this dark chamber,\nplanning, organizing, molding my destiny, yet unassuming, unnoticed, unseen,\nunheeded.\n\nWhat charm you cast around, what stupendous work you do, invisible\nfriends. Are you afraid to plainly appear in the crude scorching gaze of human\nminds? Do you fear to be hurt by twilight-pale unthinking mentalities, or\nchoked by the gross vibrations of noisy matter ?\n\nYet how stealthily you go out of the dark chamber to build the huge sky-\nscrapers, the mighty bridges, and all daring material achievements, then slip | ।\naway, unknown, unthanked, unhonored, unsought.

They come,\nfade away, and are short-lasting. Endure them thou, O Bharata.\"\n\n== Bhagavad-Gita 2:14 2:14\n\nADVICE Because of its inner contact with the soul, the ego hides within\n\nIN GITA itself a dormant expectation of permanent equilibrated states of\nconsciousness. By identifying itself with the body the ego be-\n\ncomes disturbed, for it then cognizes only impermanent experiences. Thus\n\nthe ego is deceived when it fixes its expectations upon the fickle senses in-\n\nstead of upon the permanent joy-giving soul. So the Gita warns the spiritual\n\naspirant not to confuse his soul by close association with the senses, which\n\nwill make him miserable and forgetful of his innate blessed state. The ideas ©\n\nof heat, cold, pleasure, and pain are suggested by the senses and cannot be\n\nfelt by the ego if it keeps a strong undisturbed matter-disengaged mind.\n\nThe word titiksha (endurance) does not imply that one should rashly ex-\npose the body to intense cold or heat and thus endanger physical existence.\nIf the body is sense-enslaved and unspiritualized, you should protect it from\nextremes, at the same time mentally disciplining it to rise above its slavery.\nIt is only when the spiritually developed mind realizes its aloofness that the\nsuggestions of suffering, born of the senses, do not register in the conscious-\nness. Ultimately, when one sees the body as condensed Spirit, through reali-\nzation (and not through imagination, as many try to do), one finds that Spirit\nis above suffering.\n\nTo protect the body from extreme heat or cold is not wrong. Artificially\ncooled or steam-heated apartments can temporarily comfort the body and re-\nmove physical suffering arising from high or low extremes of temperature.\nThese are the methods generally adopted by modern man; but constant minis-\ntrations to, and changes adapted to the demands of the body often enslave it to\nthe impositions of environment. Herein lies the fundamental difference be-\ntween the East and the West in their methods of combating suffering. The\nGita gives unique advice as to what one should do when invaded by sensations\nof heat or cold, pain or pleasure. It states that an environment-enslaved ©\nbody is a constant trouble to the mind. An enslaved body is apt to enslave\nthe all-powerful mind, whereas: ''The soul that with a strong and constant\n\n"}

'।\n\nPSYCHOLOGY A deep metaphysical problem is involved in understanding\nOF PAIN the psychology of pain. Stimuli of cold, heat, hardness or\n\nsoftness, etc., touch the nerve endings of the body and are\ntransmitted through the nerve electricity and nerve wires as sensations. No\none knows exactly what sensations are. We experience them as the immedi-\nate feelings produced by the contact of the senses with matter. Sensations of\ncold and heat are entirely different from the objects which produce coldness\nor warmth. Contact with ice or with hot water is experienced only as an idea.\nA sensation, or first-flowing feeling, produced in the mind through contact\nwith material objects, is elaborated in perception. It is expanded into concep-\ntion, and lastly, conception changes into feeling.\n\nFeeling is that faculty which passes judgment upon the experiences of the\nsenses. It expresses itself in terms of pain or pleasure of the body, or sor-\nrow or happiness of the mind. Sensitive feelings become so accustomed to\npassing quick judgments upon the nature of specific sensations they experi-\nence that the all-powerful mind succumbs to these disturbances. Sensitive\nfeelings magnify sensations. Instead of academically and impartially experi-\nencing the variety of sensations permeating the body, they create pleasure or\npain out of the attitudes of likes and dislikes that they whimsically form in\ntheir hasty judgment of the nature of specific sensations. In short, feeling\n\n‘classifies all experiences as being pleasurable or painful, according to its ~~\n\nown preconceived likes and dislikes. If its judgment could be neutralized,\nthat is, made impervious to short-lasting excitations or ephemeral pleasures\nand pains, then all experiences would be merely intellectually cognized. Most\nwild animals (not those that become sensitive through domestication), savages\nor other persons living close to nature, and children suffer far less than other\npeople from cold or heat or pain owing to their lack of magnifying mental\nsensitiveness.\n\nConsciousness of pain, either physical or mental, is solely a mental ex-\nperience and is created by the ego and feeling. One may reason: \"If anyone\nhit the shinbone of my leg with a hammer, I'd cry out with pain. I would not\nbe imagining that pain.'' Or, ‘Imagination of pain, as in the hurt in a dream,\nand pain itself are certainly different. '' However, the only difference between\nimaginary and physical pain is that the former may be roused by imagination\nand the latter roused by feeling born of a sensation. Both of them are mind-\nborn. Dream-born pains hurt as much in the subconsciousness as actual\nphysical pain in the waking consciousness.\n\nDETACHED MIND Some people have the opinion that sensation is the feel-\nFEELS NO PAIN ing, Or consciousness, Or a certain state existing in\nthe nerves and flesh. Even if this were so, sensations\ncannot be felt without the action of the mind. A knife may be thrust into the\nflesh of a person under chloroform, but, though the stimulus is present,\nthere is no sensation, nor is there any feeling to create pain. This proves\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 1248, "text": "S-6 P-161 4\n\nthat when the mind is detached by deadening of the nerve centers, it cannot\nfeel the nature of a stimulus as an inharmonious sensation, nor can it create @\nthe feeling of pain. Sensation is only a mental attitude born of the state a\n\nparticular stimulus creates in nerves or flesh. Of course, the birth of a\n\nmental attitude as sensation must exactly correspond to the nature of a stim-\n\nulus applied to the body. Sensations of cold, heat, and distinctions between\n\nvarious stimuli visiting the body, give rise to different states of conscious-\n\nness, or.sensations. .\n\nCareful attention should be given to the idea of the genesis of pain or\npleasure. Let us go over this again. All stimuli applied to the body at first\njust report themselves in the brain as distinct sensations cognized by the dis-\ncriminative faculty of man. Gradually, the mind begins to recognize the sen-\nsations in terms of utility. That is, after its appearance in the body a sensa-\ntion begins to reveal whether it is harmonious or inharmonious to the condi-\ntions of the body. Thereupon the feeling becomes roused and begins to devel-\nop likes or dislikes in connection with the various sensations. This innate\nfeeling (known in animals as instinct) instead of intellectually cognizing body\nsensations as merely harmonious or inharmonious, begins to feel pleasure or\npain. A strong attraction toward a certain set of sensations produces the\nsatisfied mental state called \"pleasure. '' A strong aversion to a certain train\nof sensations develops pain. That is why people in whom feeling is predomi-\nnant suffer heat and cold more than evenly balanced mentalities. Physical\npleasure and pain are derived through a long-continued mental habit. That is | ।\nwhy harmful, distasteful drugs give imaginary joy to some, and the first\ntaste of a wholesome, delicious fruit is sometimes repugnant to other people.\n\nTwo children of the same age and health, but varying in the degree of sen-\nsitiveness, made to walk ten miles under the hot sun, or to undergo a minor,\npainful operation without the use of chloroform or local anesthetic, will be-\nhave differently. The child in whom feeling predominates may collapse dur-\ning the walk, or cry or become hysterical during the operation; whereas the\nchild in whom reason predominates may smilingly walk the ten miles and not\nbe afraid to do the same thing all over again. He may calmly watch the oper-\nation upon himself as something wonderfully interesting. A doctor once\ncheerfully performed upon himself a complicated operation for hernia. Ma-\nhatma Gandhi underwent an appendectomy without any anesthetic, chatting\ncheerfully with his disciples during the operation. He was able to detach his\nmind at will from sensations.\n\nPain or physical pleasure, although they accompany body sensations,\nare not created by the stimuli or the sensations, but are created by feeling,\nimagination, and mental habits born of environmental and hereditary influ-\nences. Just as bad or good habits may be transmitted from generation to gen-\neration, so the consciousness of pain is bequeathed to mankind from erring\npredecessors. As formerly the whole world believed the earth to be flat, so | ।\na belief in pain has been inherited by modern man from his ancestors, who\nwere not sufficiently versed in psychology to check the growth of the mental\ndisease of belief in pain.\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 1249, "text": "5-6 P-161 5\n\nIn India, where there is a general belief that eating ice cream in winter\npredisposes one to catch cold, a Hindu friend of mine used to catch cold when-\never he ate ice cream in winter. When he came to America, he was surprised\nto find Americans eating ice cream in winter without any ill effects. He forth-\nwith followed their example and suffered no more colds, which had previously\nbeen brought on by his own expectations. Anyone can bring to mind numerous\ninstances of such self-imposed troubles.\n\nPAIN IS A MAN- Being made in God's image of joy, we never were meant\nMADE DELUSION to suffer pain. It appeared in man first in the nature of\n\na mild desire to warn himself of the advent of an inhar-\nmonious sensation detrimental to the interest of the body. Instead of proving\nitself such a friend and guide to the body, pain turned out to be a veritable\ntyrant-torturer that caused the tears of mankind to flow.\n\nThis hereditary terror of pain has brought forth fears and cries from self-\nhypnotized souls, much as the imagined sight of a ghost makes a child cry out\nin panic. The absent consciousness of a chloroformed person cannot create\npain; on the other hand, a well-balanced mind may recognize the presence of\nan inharmonious sensation in the body without being sensitive to it and thus\ncreating pain. That is the purpose of the spartan Boy Scout method of train-\ning and of the Yoga systems of bodily discipline and endurance. They are not\nforms of self-torture, but practical methods for lessening the suggestion of\n\n“pain by developing the resisting power of the mind.\n\nIMAGINATION - Sensitiveness is the root cause, the primeval mother of\nBORN SORROWS all pain and mental sorrow. Inharmonious physical sen-\n\nsations--for instance, that of a thorn in the foot--give\nrise to the imagination of pain, just as the inharmonious thought of the loss\nof a loved possession or friend may cause sorrow. Some imagination-born\nsorrows cause more suffering than excruciating pain-giving body sensations.\nI know of a man who died of corroding mental agony over the death of his\nbeloved. Though he walked, talked, and took food, he declined as rapidly as\nif he were suffering from some dread disease. He soon pined away to his\ndeath, though there was no sign of physical sickness.\n\nThus it is wrong to acknowledge pain or sympathize with misery-making\nsensitiveness in people, for it strengthens the delusion of pain and sorrow.\nAll wrong ideas must be gradually overcome by the mind first, then by the\nbody. The Gita says that instead of catering all the time to the whims of\ncold or warmth, one should learn to endure them, by mental control. The\nGita does not advise rashness suchas putting one's hand in fire or lying un-\nclothed upon snowy ground. It does suggest that the body, though trademarked\nwith mortality by limitations of the maya-guided human mind, is actually\nmaterialized Cosmic Consciousness. Since fire and ice are also materialized\nCosmic Consciousness, how can they engender suffering in the body? The\nhuman soul must break away from the self-imposed imaginary limitations of\nthe body in order to learn that everything in the phenomenal universe is made\n\n"}

He should\nnot follow a method that is powerful but which may kill him when he uses it.\nThe cure should not be worse than the disease. He should train himself grad-\nually. One should first realize that sitting in a draft does not produce a cold.\nPractice using less heat. Never be afraid of the outdoors. Know that snow\nand the burning sun are but materialized God Consciousness, the same as your\nbody. By reason we can understand that these similar forces cannot hurt the\nbody or cause pain. We must realize that nothing but life exists, and that pain\ncomes only through pemm itting one rate of vibration, or state of consciousness,\nto affect another.\n\nPain comes through identification. Just as a mother suffers at the sight\nof her child's suffering through an accident, the mothering mind suffers if any\ninharmony is present in the body child. It transfers its suffering to the body\nand vice versa. Another person, witnessing the above-mentioned accident,\nmay feel scarcely any of the pain that the mother feels. Sympathy, or identi-\nfication, causes pain. One must be impartial, and not excited. This does not\nmean that one should neglect. an accident to the body, or think that attending\nto its cure is detrimental to the interest of the body; the idea is not to concen-\ntrate on the sensation of pain.\n\nUNCHANGING A mentally sensitive man, a ''touchy\" person, is always feel-\nQUALITIES ing hurt by material contacts and by his conversations with\nOF SPIRIT people. If the weather is bad he moans and makes a person-\nal tragedy of it. Or after a conversation he says, ''Oh, I\n'read between the lines' of Mr. John's words, and he has hurt me terribly. \"'\nA cheerful person, understanding the way of the world, may ignore the in-\nclement weather; in spite of persecutions he wears a soul-warming smile and\nloves his fellowman as much as ever.\n\nThat is why stimuli and sensations of heat and cold, or of body wounds,\nshould be cognized by the mind only as ideas. The mentally sensitive person\nalways is troubled by suggestions of a hot summer day, or a very cold night,\nor a slight operation. Man's body must be made pain-proof, until in it are\nfound--not the decaying, hurting, changing qualities of matter--but the invul-\nnerable, unchanging qualities of Spirit. Consciousness cannot hurt conscious-\nness without acceptance... It is very:difficult to hurt an ever-smiling wise\nman who considers all the injury done to him as due to ignorance. He refuses\nto allow his consciousness to acknowledge or accept the inharmonious ideas\nof other people. He knows that the ego's process of cognition and any hurt-\nsuggesting thought can be linked only by feeling. Thought can never be hurt-\nful unless feeling overpowers it; that is, consciousness cannot be hurt by con-\nsciousness without conscious acceptance. Certain conditions in the body,\nbeing inharmonious, suggest pain, but that does not mean that they should be\ngiven the opportunity to be successful in producing pain.\n\n"}

Your mind manufactures pain. When under the influence of\nchloroform, you do not feel pain because the mind is other-\nwise occupied and is unresponsive to sensory impressions.\n\n2. Pain is a friend that warns you of bodily troubles, and is not\nintended to be atorturer. While adopting the proper remedies\nagainst inharmonious conditions in the body, do not give way\nto the suggestions of pain by allowing the mind to become\nidentified with the body's condition. Pain is comparatively\nshort-lasting and has its limitations.\n\n3. Divert your mind during pain by directing it into engrossing\nwork. Keep calm and do not dwell upon the sensations.\n\n4. Association with stronger-minded, or less pain-sensitive people\nis beneficial.\n\n5. The best way to overcome sorrow is to know that it springs from\nidentification. Sorrow is not overcome by sorrow, but by joy.\nSome sorrows we like to indulge in, but do not let sorrow stay\nwith you too long, for it will rob you of the richest of your\nsoul's possessions--perennial bliss.\n\nभरकम\n"}

The true image of Spirit\n--that is, individualized Spirit or the immortal Soul--survives the physical body\nand gathers to itself another body through which to work out the traces of forme\ndesires and actions that have lodged in the subtle bodies accompanying the soul\nin its passage through incarnations. Matter suppresses the Spirit as Spirit\ntries to reform or raise matter by evolutional coaxing and expansion.\n\nReincarnation represents the successive stages through which the Spirit re-\nturns to Itself--from manifestation as the many to reunion in the One (Itself).\nReincarnation cannot be fully understood intellectually; it must be realized. One\nmust become conscious of this process within one's self, through meditation\nand through becoming aware of the source of desire, which is the root cause of\naction that turns the wheel of cause and effect. Reincarnation is scientific and\nis an accepted doctrine of many religions, representing more than half of the\nhuman race. One very definite reference to reincarnation in the Christian\n\n| । Bible is found in Revelation 3:12: \"Him that overcometh will I.make a pillar in\nthe temple of my God, and he shall go no more out.'' That is, he that over-\ncomes bodily desires will not have to reincarnate on the physical plane to go\nout in pursuit of the fulfillment of desires. ''He that hath an ear, let him hear\n\n"}

The\nillustration of the three jars of salt water, each one within another, floating\nin the ocean, clarifies this point.\n\nMan has three bodies, as follows:\n\na physical body of sixteen chemical elements;\n\nan astral body of nineteen elements (mind, ego, chittwa,\nintelligence, ten senses, five pranas);\n\n3. a spiritual or idea body of thirty-five elements (seed ideas\n\ncorresponding to the sixteen elements of the physical\n\nbody and nineteen elements of the astral body).\n\nNE\n\nThe soul is encased in the \"bottle\" of the idea body, which is stopped with\nthe cork of spiritual ignorance. After death of the physical body, the astral\nbody carries the discordant vibration of unfulfilled desires which must be re-\nsolved in other physical embodiments. The ten astral senses are the real\norgans. The ten physical senses are their instruments or modes of expres-\nsion. The astral body must take on another physical body in order to manifest\nthe tendencies of action and desire created by the senses.\n\nDesire directs energy. Unfulfilled desires form energy whose momentum\nis directed toward fulfillment. Since the astral body lacks instruments of ex-\npression, it must be \"reborn\" in another physical body to materialize these\ntendencies.

Nevertheless the ''missing link\" be-\ntween animal and man has never been found. Because man has animal charac-\nteristics it is assumed that he has evolved from the animal. This is not cor-\nrect. Manis a special creation. All mine rals, plants, and animal bodies are\n\nmade of intelligence and electrons. Spirit is the intelligence in all matter,\nalways conscious, but not self-conscious until it becomes individualized in\nman. After passing through progressive experiences--through the various\nmineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms--it transmigrates for further ad-\nvancement in specially created human bodies. This began with Adam and Eve,\nthe first man and woman. Animal characteristics are soul memories, or in-\nstincts, that cling to the disembodied astral vehicle of the soul after physical\ndeath, and impel rebirth in a physical body so that they may be fulfilled on the\nmaterial plane. Adam and Eve, although empowered to create immaculately\nafter their own kind, awakened the sex instinct in the tree of life, the cerebro-\nspinal centers. By indulging in the sense of touch, and ignoring the warning\nof God, Adam and Eve lost the power of creating immaculately, and had to re-\nproduce their own kind in the animal way.\n\nAction through ignorance, desire, selfish craving, and instinctive reaction\n“to self-created environment forms a vicious circle, which carries the becloud-\ned soul on and on through thousands of incarnations until it becomes conscious\nof this process, and Self-consciously reverses it. Actions performed in full\nunderstanding, and without material desire, bring the process to an end and\nturn the soul toward its infinite home, God. Even the highest earthly desire\n\nof the soul is limiting in comparison to the eternal kingdom of the cosmos.\n\nTo be desireless does not mean to be negligent and without ambition. That\nwould result in stagnation. Man must be divinely ambitious to do God's will,\nand to perform all duties for Him without selfish attachment and craving. He\nneed not goto the forest, for earthly desires can follow him there. He can be\nin the world but not of it--nonattached--using all his faculties and powers in\nplaying out his role in life for God, in perfect understanding of His will.\n\nॐ NO. 134 At physical death the disembodied soul seeks its own\n\nvibratory level; it is drawn where those of like qualities\nare grouped together. Not all souls can go wherever they like in space. Vir-\ntuous souls with deep realization have greater freedom and do not have physical\nrebirth forced upon them. They may come or go from earth as they wish.\n\nThe usual understanding of the term ''disembodied soul\" is a soul that has\nlost the physical body.

If human love\nfails to purify itself in one soul, it will keep on seeking in this span of life and\nbeyond until it finds the expression of all perfections of divine love. When\nperfect pure love and unconditional friendship are expressed between two souls,\nthat love will be registered as one divine love.

This law of action, or cause and effect, is termed karma.

You should un-\nderstand the cause of your present conditions, and put forth definite effort to\ndestroy any undesirable tendencies. Your present state is determined by seed\ntendencies of past lives, and your comprehensive will-efforts of this life. When\nin meditation the vital power is felt, that ray of vital sense must be switched to\nthe brain and held there to scorch out the lurking seeds of failure or disease.\n\nNo matter how great a failure one may seem to be, one should remember\nthat there are always success tendencies buried somewhere in the subconscious\nmind, and that it is possible to rouse them by repeated judicious, initiative\neffort. A yogi may not possess much, but through his ability to focus his mind\nhe learns.to create at will whatever he needs at any giventime. Of course, true\nyogis do not entertain personal desire. Their one desire is that God's love shall\nreign on the shrine of their souls, and that they may kindle His love in the hearts\nof others.\n\nBlind selfishness is the root cause of unbalanced prosperity. Those rich\npeople who, having themselves acquired success, ignore the agonies of others\nthat fail, do much to upset the balance.\n\nLESSON NO. 138 In order to comprehend methods of rejuvenation intelli-\n\ngently, one should have some understanding of what a hu-\nman body really is: a bundle of forces whirling together in ultra-rapid motion.\nAll the tiny cells are grouped together by a chemical force to form the various\ntissues of the body. These cellular molecules are in turn made of whirling\natoms, protons, and electrons. These in their turn are made of condensed\nsemi-intelligent sparks of vital force. Below the surface of the vital sparks lie\nthe waves of sensation, and beneath them are waves of thought, feeling, and\nwill force. Hidden below all the layers of vibratory waves is the ego.\n\nThe vital force is a manifestation of the vast force that expresses itself in\nall forms of subconsciousness, waking consciousness, superconsciousness,\nChrist Consciousness, and Cosmic Consciousness. The body as a solid sub-\nstance occupies externally a very small space, but since that ''substance, '' on\nthe internal side, is actually condensed Cosmic Consciousness, it is essential-\nly vast and omnipresent.\n\n"}

Because It created everything out\n\nof Itself, Spirit became triune: It is the Knower, the process of Knowing, and\n\nthe thing Known. Spirit accomplished this seeming division of Itself by the\n\nlaw of relativity, or cosmic delusion, by which everything and every being in\n\ncreation holds the appearance of finiteness and separateness from the Infinite\n\nSpirit. The many were supposed to find the Bliss of Spirit by Self-seeking,\n\nindependent effort.\n\nThe cosmic delusion, or Satan--the cosmic conscious force repulsed from\nSpirit in the act of creating the universe--holds the essential qualities of Spirit;\nhence it has independent creative power and free choice in using it. Individual-\nized souls, evolved out of Spirit by the subtle force of cosmic delusion, instead\nof being conscious of their true identity as living waves of the cosmic sea of\nLife, essentially immortal, were deluded into believing themselves isolated\nfrom Spirit, having ''birth'' and \"death,'' or \"origin'' and \"decay.

Self-defense, its cruelties,\nthe desire to kill in order to eat, were suggested to man by the cosmic law of\ndelusion. Thus satanic delusion took advantage of its independence to pull all\nthings away from God. Until humanity awakens, it is under the influence of\nthis cosmic satanic dream.\n\nThis infinite cosmic dream of finitude does not affect Spirit, but it does\naffect the individualized souls. The power of the Infinite wants all the individu-\nalized points of consciousness to enjoy Its bliss consciously, and is constantly\ntrying to call back everything to merge into this bliss consciousness.

True devotees,\nsuch as Jesus, will readily give up their lives rather than act contrary to a\ndivine principle.\n\nLESSON NO. 147 God gave us reason that we might find freedom. We can-\n\nnot live without that power of reason. Independence,\nreason, discrimination accompanied by will power directed into activity--these,\nbalanced by meditation and vitalized by devotion, lead to freedom.\n\nIn reality, you contain all wisdom within yourself; you must know how to\nbecome aware that you have it. To acquire all the wisdom in the world in one\nlifetime from books would be impossible. But there is another angle of ap-\nproach: By intuition, that power of Spirit inherited by the soul, we can per-\nceive all things directly without any other faculty. To have conscious knowl-\nedge of all things in nature, unselfish sympathy with all hearts, to see and feel\nyourself omnipresent in all and behind all, is to perceive all with Cosmic Con-\nsciousness. <A yogi does not take this as a mental concept, but really merges\nhis little self in the selves of others so that he feels his consciousness moving\nthrough all.\n\nHave a purpose in life. Do not sacrifice your soul on the altar of indiffer-\nence. Cut through the cocoon of ignorance; develop your wings of intuition and\nfly to the Infinite Beloved. You should neither be content to be an unreasoning\npart of the cogwheel of the machine of activity, nor yet become lost in devotion\nwithout activity. Devotion without work may turn into mere emotion. Medita-\ntion balances all. Find out what you are and why you are here. Make the\nsearch for God your purpose in life.\n\nLESSON NO. 148 Release from a prison is conditional to the fact that one\n\nmust first have entered the prison. All unfulfilled de-\nsires create necessity for rebirth. Souls that come on earth and misuse their\nGod-given free will become caught on the wheel of karma, the law of cause and\neffect, and have to roam in the labyrinthine pathways of rebirths, and conse-\nquently experience painful deaths. The only way to liberation is to find the all-\ndesire-quenching God-Bliss in ecstatic meditation. Through forgetfulness of\nits Source, a soul identifies itself with its body-cage; thus the pain of death is\ndue more to the psychological reason of the soul's attachment to the body than\nto physiological reasons.\n\nUntimely deaths are undesirable because premature death by sickness 07 death by sickness or\n\naccident:\n\n"}

The\nfear of death by the unenlightened is partly due to simple fear of the unknown--\nas a child's fear of the dark--and the ego's instinctive rebellion against the\nseeming finality of death; also to the fear of pain, although death is really cessa-\ntion of all bodily pain. The only pain is mental, and the momentary feeling of\nsuffocation inthe lungs. The enlightened one who has learned that the soul's\nexistence is not dependent upon breath, may watch without fear or sorrow the\nretirement of the life force from muscles, sensory nerves of smell and taste,\n\nand from-the-optic_and auditory nerves. -Consciousness is last retained-in- the... -\n\nspine, and the actual death or decay of the body does not result until the con-\nsciousness retires from the medullary plexus. The enlightened one rejoices in\nthis freedom, and even the ignorant one will awaken from the bondage of the\ndream life to immortality. To know God is to be free from the cosmic dream\ndelusion of mortal life.\n\nYou are sent to this plane to express the Infinite consciously. The Infinite\nis ever new, inexhaustible in Its creativeness. Through you It seeks to express\na unique phase of Itself. Examine yourself deeply, and try to determine wheth-\ner you are thwarting or freeing the divine creative impulse of your being. Con-\nsciously make the effort to harmonize with this divine principle of life and so\nuse this infinite self-renewing power which is yours. You and your Father are\nOne.\n\nLESSON NO. 150 According to the sage Patanjali of India, ultimate proof\n\nof substance consists in sense perception, inference, and\nintuition. Since inference is dependent upon the limitations of sense perceptions,\nboth may err. Therefore the intuitive perception in man is required to find the\nultimate proof of Truth. It is through this intuitive perception that God may be\nknown to man. That is why the development of his sixth sense, or intuition, is\nof supreme importance. The way to the Ultimate can be traversed by pursuing\nthe line of intuitive perception, as followed and practiced by men of realization.\n\nScience and religion can both agree to the presence of God as intelligent\n\n"}

A word consists of a sound, a significance, a .\nthought, and the energy required to utter it. There is activity where there is ©\nsound. The cosmic motor is working and Aum is its resultant sound--the cos-\n\nmic Name. The cosmic Name signifies the cosmic sound, cosmic intelligence,\ncosmic energy. He who has heard and become one with the cosmic song of cre-\n\nation knows the scientific, practical way of contacting God. This sound is unutter-\n\nable by the human voice andis inaudible to the human ear. But when, by inter-\niorizing the attention and switching off the senses, one can disconnect his mind\n\nfrom the senses, and can perceive the inner world, his first discovery of God\n\nis through the cosmic sound. Aum as uttered by the human voice is not the\n\ntrue sound, but is as near as the human voice can imitate it. The cosmic\n\nName, or ''Word,'' is the vibratory physical manifestation of the transcendental\n\nGod. Those who concentrate upon Aum find that this cosmic sound, or God, al-\n\n80 manifests as cosmic ever-new bliss, cosmic wisdom, cosmic love, cosmic\n\nlight, and cosmic life force. These are definite qualities of God. A true knowl-\n\nedge of God and His Name, thus superconsciously or intuitively perceived, is\n\nthe only way to ultimate freedom.\n\nThought creates according to its own nature. You are always demonstrat-\ning according to the kind of thoughts you entertain. Cosmic energy, through\nthe will, feeds the medulla oblongata, which in turn feeds the five sense plexus-\nes. As the cells are but condensed will and energy, they can be renewed by the\npower of your strong, unflinching will. Never energize destructive or negative\nthoughts. Establish positive, constructive habits of creative thought.\n\nLESSON NO. 151 You must bring God into your daily life. God answers\n\nthrough law; you will not find Him by blind prayer and\njust waiting for the visitation of love. Right meditation, as well as love and\nactive devotion, is necessary to contact and know God. You are one with the\nFather; therefore, you are one with all minds, all hands, all feelings, all\nbeauty, all life.

When by\nactual Self-realization, consciousness is gained of oneness with all love, all\nwisdom, all power, there comes a spiritual rebirth,and geniusis born.

When one realizes that\nmaterial desires are caused by body consciousness or ego, in forgetfulness of the\nshining unpolluted soul hidden beneath the desire accumulations, it becomes ob-\nvious that body consciousness is the source of the vicious circle and is there-\nfore the foe to be vanquished.\n\nHabit tendencies are stubborn soldiers, not realizing that their existence\ndepends upon the state of consciousness of their host.

As\na result, untested beliefs, cults, and superstitions have prevailed, and much\ncruelty and exploitation have taken place through fear and fanaticism.\n\nScientists should test the methods offered by religions, and should thus\ndiscover by practical application the best method, that which brings the great-\nest good to the greatest number of people. Then they should broadcast the\nknowledge they have acquired, in the name of truth. Church funds would be\nwell employed in inducing great scientists to make investigations to discover\nthe most practical technique for applying those immutable principles that pro-\ntect man permanently from the threefold suffering of disease, unhappiness,\nand ignorance. Science should engage in making man himself invulnerable to\nthe destruction arising from his own inventions, and make him more conscious\nof his own powers over disease and tragic or premature death.

God's inner spiritual\nnature is perfect, ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new bliss, although\nHis outward nature differentiated in cosmic vibration as perceived by human\nbeings appears distorted and imperfect. God as expressed in nature is un-\nknown, mysterious, elusive, indifferent. God as revealed to the devotee is\nintimate, sociable, indescribably lovely, and consciously interested in remov-\ning all man's miseries. All pursuits of life offer only partial joy, although\ncrowned with utmost fulfillment. But when you have found God, you have\nfound the reservoir of perennial, unending Bliss.\n\nLESSON NO. 161 To overcome pain and sorrow the nature of their origin\nmust first be understood. One should train himself\ngradually to rise above these sensations. Pain comes through identification\nof the ego withthe senses. Stimuli of cold and heat touch the nerve endings of\nthe body and are transmitted through the nerve electricity and nerve wires as\nsensations. A sensation, after its appearance in the body as the immediate\nfeelings produced by the contact of the senses and matter, begins to reveal\nwhether it is harmonious or inharmonious to the conditions of the body. Feel-\ning is that faculty which passes judgment upon the experiences of the senses.\nA sense-enslaved body is apt to enslave the all-powerful mind. If feeling\ncould be neutralized, that is, made impervious to ephemeral excitations, then\nall experiences would be merely intellectually cognized. A strong mind may\nrecognize the presence of an inharmonious sensation in the body without being\nsensitive to it as pain. _\n\nPainappeared first in man in the nature of a desire to warn himself of the\nadvent of an inharmonious sensation detrimental to the interests of the body.\nThus, a sensitivity was developed through wrong environment and hereditary\ninfluences, imagination, mental habits, and feeling. Sensitive feelings get so\nused to passing quick judgments upon the nature of specific sensations they\nexperience that the all-powerful mind becomes deluded and succumbs to the\ndisturbance. That is why feeling-predominant people suffer heat and cold\nmore than evenly balanced mentalities.\n\nOne should not rashly impose a cure that may be worse than the disease.\nA sense-enslaved and unspiritualized body should be protected from extremes.\nAll wrong ideas should be gradually overcome by the mind first, then by the\nbody. Consciousness cannot hurt consciousness without acceptance. We must\nrealize that nothing but life exists and that pain comes only through permitting\none state of consciousness to affect another state of consciousness. Since pain\ncomes through identification with the senses, this can be counteracted by the\nrealization of the soul's inner identification with Spirit, for within the ego is\nhidden the expectation of permanent equilibrated states of consciousness.\nWhile adopting the proper remedies against inharmonious conditions in the\nbody, do not give way to the suggestions of pain by allowing the mind to become\nidentified with the bodily condition. Man should persistently strive to make\nhis body pain-proof, until he knows it has its origin not in the decaying, hurting,\n"}

No one can really present a gift to God because all things belong to Him,\nbut to give unto the Lord the gifts that are given by Him shows an appreciative heart.\nBetter than material gifts offered in stone-made temples, God loves the gifts of love,\npeace, and devotion offered in the temple of one’s own heart or through the temples of\nthe hearts of others.\n\nThat is why Jesus said that, before you try to offer a gift to God in a temple of\nstones, you should offer Him a temple of harmony by becoming reconciled to an es-\ntranged brother.

The Master\nquietly said:\n\n“If a man, sitting with closed eyes in a church, allows his thoughts to dwell on\nworldly matters—the idols of materialism—God is aware that He is not being wor-\nshiped.\n\n“If a man, bowing before a stone image, sees it as a symbol and reminder of the\nliving omnipresent Spirit, God accepts that worship.”\n\n* KO\n\nEvery time that the Master saw a certain disciple, who was decidedly the intel-\nlectual type, the guru would say:\n“Get devotion! Remember the words of Jesus: ‘Father, thou hast hid these things\n\nfrom the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.’’’+\n* मं मं\n\nThe disciple visited Master at his desert retreat shortly before Christmas of 1951.\nOn a table lay some toys, intended for gifts. In a childlike spirit Paramahansaji played\nwith them for a time, then asked the young man, “How do you like them?”\n\nThe disciple was still trying to get over his surprise; but he said, laughing,\n“They’re fine, 317.\" The Master smiled and quoted:\n\n“Suffer the little children to come unto me, for such is the Kingdom of God.’”’+\n\n@ * Mark 12:38-44. ‡ Luke 18:16.\n+ Matthew 11:25.\n\n"}

Think of the long time you ignored Him!\n\n“Meditate more; go deep; and follow the hermitage rules.

Every\nday I am active for Him. This path is wonderful! After a little while you see that God\nis continuously playing hide-and-seek with you.\n\nThe Lord is found through unceasing devotion. When you want only the Giver,\nand not His gifts, then He will come to you. He has given you free choice and will\npower in order that you may experience and know the difference between the lesser\ngifts of the world and the greater gift of His presence. When you understand that you\nshould be tempted only by the bliss of God, then you will conquer. Merely wishing\nfor God is not sufficient; your actions must conform to your desire. You must materi-\nalize your wish into right activity. Then you will find Him.\n\nConnect all your activities with God. Follow the law with devotion and there\ncannot be any failure, there cannot be any sidetracking; for remember, much is for-\ngiven that person who has devotion. If you have devotion, you shall be free. Follow\nthe law with devotion. When you are devoted to your Heavenly Father and at the\nsame time do your best according to the principles of concentration and meditation,\nthen the result comes; for God measures through law, although He is beyond all laws.\n\nWhere there is real devotion, God surrenders Himself. It gives the finishing\ntouches to your spiritual development. But devotion without obedience is not\nhonored by God; His laws must be followed. The spiritual laws of emancipation,\nplus devotion, are necessary. You are a child of the Divine. You are a prince of the\n\n@ _ cosmos. Don’t treat yourself like a beggar, but like 8 child of God. 22 --------\n\nThrough your loyalty to Him, you can establish your Oneness with Him. God is\nequally present in all, but in the heart of the spiritually minded, loyal person, who\nthinks only of Him, God is most definitely expressed. Realize your soul’s perfection.\nBe loyal, as loyalty attracts the Divine Attention. By your loyalty, you will be able to\nreach God.\n\nIf you say: ‘“When will I find God?” you are not yet a true devotee. The true devo-\ntee says: “I have found Him. He is listening to me; my Beloved is always with me. He\nis moving my hands; He is digesting my food; He is gazing at me through the stars.”\n\nWithout God you can’t live even for a second! He is caressing you through the\nbreeze and giving you life through the sunshine. He is in the food you eat, He is in\nthe hearts of all the people around you, He is the only one that you can call your own.\n\nThat is why you should use all the strength of your soul to find God. He is not the\nmonopoly of any one person; nor may He be bribed. God doesn’t need our praise.\nThat approach to Him implies some strain and effort, like a lover’s praising the be-\nloved all the time just to keep her pleased. God doesn’t want that kind of relationship\nwith you. But divine, unconditional love is beautiful. There is no other gift you can\ngive Him but the gift of your love. If God could ever be said to beg from us, it is for\nour love. If He wants anything at all from us, it is our love.\n\nReal Devotion Manifests Within\n\nके Real devotion is internal. Day and night the devotee thinks of nothing but God,\nand secretly tells Him how dearly he loves Him. The devotee seldom talks about his\nlove for the Lord; he lives it. He keeps it within, for true love shuns outward demon-\n\n"}

Devotees of God express their love in the seclusion of\nthe soul temple within, and do not parade it before others. What is external is not\ndeep.\n\nThe true devotee’s heart is always saying: ‘““My Lord, my Lord, I do not want to\nbecome ensnared in the delusory drama of Thy creation. I want no part of it except\nto help in establishing Thy temple in the souls of men. My heart, my soul, my body\nand mind—everything belongs to Thee.” Such devotion reaches God. That devotee\nknows God.\n\nWe all should be like little children before God. He must come first, middle, and\nlast. When we find God, then all our desires are fulfilled.\n\nTo the one who is very deeply devoted, God talks. He is invisible, but if you have\nenough devotion, you can find Him, for He becomes frozen into manifestation by\ndevotion’s power.\n\nNo matter what you are doing, say inwardly, ‘I am Thine, I want to know Thee\nbefore I leave this body.” If you try, He will receive you. Love Him—that is why we\nare here. Cry for Him and never go to sleep until you feel Him. When you cry and cry\nfor God, and an answering joy comes over you, then you will know that He has heard\nyou. .\n\nHe is purposely hiding. If we talk to Him without love, He is only pestered to\ndeath; that is why He remains quiet. To make Him talk you have to give Him the\n“third 46६1661\" of your love. Then He will talk. And I assure you, if I didn’t know that\nHe talks I wouldn’t tell you. It is so touching, because it is He who has become all\nhuman beings. When you see Him, you see Him working through all. The Gita says,\n‘Behold Him through every niche of space, on the altar of every heart, and He shall\nbehold you wherever you see Him.” It is only by loving God that we can love others\nas God.\n\nYou must be very secret about your love for God, and you have to be very silent\nabout your love. You must not speak about His being with you. Be like the great ones,\nwho inwardly think constantly of the Beauty behind the flowers, the Light behind\nthe sun, the Life that twinkles in all eyes, that beats in every heart; the Motion that\nwalks in all feet, that works in all hands; the Mind that is working through all brains,\nthe Love that is behind all loves.\n\nGod is so great, so marvelous! To live in the realm of divine consciousness is to\n\nsee this mundane world, ignorant of God, as a nightmare and to have eternal freedom\nfrom its terrors.\n\nYou waste precious time each day. Every little moment you spend with God will\nbe spent to your best advantage; and whatever you achieve with the desire to please\nGod in your heart will stand unto eternity. God is freedom from all misery. God is the\nwealth and the health you seek. God is the love you seek. The desire of the soul for\nGod is behind all other desires. Worldly desires camouflage the longing of the soul\nto be reunited with God-bliss. Only God can satisfy all the desires of this life and of\npast incarnations. I have found it so\n\nLet Your Devotion Shine Eternally\nDon’t be satisfied with a little peace born of your meditation, but hunger again\n\n"}

He may assume worldly respon-\nsibilities, or he may choose the path of complete renunciation.\n\nThe science of yoga (or scientific union with God) includes various\n\nmethods which may be classified as follows:\n\n1. Hatha Yoga 4. Mantra Yoga\n2. Laya Yoga 5. Raja Yoga\n3. Karma Yoga\n\nHatha Yoga is a system of physical exercises whose purpose is to\nrender the body fit for meditation; particularly, for the higher\nstates of ecstatic God-communion during which the body absorbs a\ngreater-than-usual voltage of God's cosmic energy. Fortunately for\nthe average person, it is not necessary to perform all the various\ntortuous body twistings of the yoga postures in order to prepare the\nbody for meditation. Nevertheless, meditation is not possible with-\nout some bodily control, and some of the simpler postures of Hatha\nYoga are very good indeed for this purpose. They may be practiced,\nin conjunction with a commonsense dietary regimen, with benefit to\nhealth and to mental concentration.\n\nOccasionally, older persons in an excess of zeal hurt themselves\nin attempting difficult postures and then foolishly condemn Hatha\nYoga. The eighty-four basic body postures are most effectively done\nby children and young adults. Men and women over forty should not\npractice the more difficult poses, because at that age the bones,\nmuscles, and nerves are seldom sufficiently pliable. The SRF Ener-\ngization Exercises taught in Lesson 8-A may be performed by all and\nbenefit the body in much the same way as the system of Hatha Yoga.\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 1297, "text": "The yogi should not keep the soul busy only with discipline of\n\n| । the body and thus forget the real purpose of yoga, the uniting of\nsoul and Spirit. The body discipline of Hatha Yoga is meant only\nfor preparing the physical vehicle for spiritual growth; it is not\nan end in itself. Body discipline promotes spiritual peace, and in-\ncidentally good health. Avoid becoming absorbed only in those meth-\nods that cultivate temporal physical and mental power and prowess\nand thereby attract public attention, curiosity, and commendation.\nSearch deeper.\n\n2. Laya Yoga signifies complete absorption or \"melting\" of mind in any\nmental concept of the Divine or in inner astral sounds. It consists\nof listening to the Cosmic Sound of Aum emanating from the universe\non the superconscious plane of concentration. Mantra Yoga teaches\none to utter such potent vibratory sounds aloud or mentally. Laya\nYoga teaches one to concentrate upon and be merged in the real as-\ntral sounds emanating from the various inner creative forces of God\nin nature, rather than in those astral sounds as imitated by the hu-\nman voice.\n\nAll actions on the physical or astral or causal planes are vi-\nbratory in nature, and therefore produce sounds: a whisper produces\na physical sound; astral bells produce music that can be heard with\nthe inner ear; and the countless thoughts emanating from the causal\nplane to structure the universe can be heard as the Cosmic Vibra-\n| । tion, the spiritual sound of Aum.\n\n3. Karma Yoga signifies union with God through good works and right ac-\ntivity, primarily, and through meditative action secondarily.\n\n4. Mantra Yoga consists in uniting soul and Spirit by concentrating--\nthrough loud chanting, soft chanting, whisper chanting, mental\nchanting, and superconscious chanting--on the root word sounds that\nare vibrating in the physical world and in the astral world.\n\n5. Raja Yoga is the \"royal\" yoga. It is the yoga method that is best\nand most inclusive. It combines simple methods of body discipline\nwith a very high meditation technique of spiritual realization,\ntechniques such as you are being taught in these Lessons. Self-\nRealization Fellowship methods teach Raja Yoga techniques of uniting\nsoul and Spirit and combine in one teaching all that is best in the\nhighest forms of yoga.\n\nIndia's great sage Patanjali outlined the yoga system of Hindu phi-\nlosophy as an eightfold path. The first steps,\n\n1. yama and 2. niyama,\n\nrequire observance of five proscriptive moralities and five positive\n@ prescriptions.\n"}

Gharana (concentration), holding the mind to one thought;\n\n7. 11४21128 (meditation); and\n\n8. samadhi (superconscious perception).\nFIRST STEP: Yama means rules that are prohibitive, and refers to\nPROSCRIPTIVE thoughts and actions from which the devotee should ab-\nRULES--YAMA stain.

To meditate a great deal without at the same time practicing\nyama-niyama is to build a large superstructure on a loose foundation.\n\nYama-niyama--the \"do's and dont's\"--are the foundation principles of\nall religions.

The purpose of posture is to enable the\nOR ASANA devotee to rise above or stop the motions of the\nbody that cause restlessness in the ego-identified\nsoul. The soul is a part of the calm Infinite, and the body is a part\nof restless nature. But the soul identifies itself with the restless\nbody and forgets its nature of infinite calmness. Therefore, in order\n\nto send the prodigal soul from the land of restlessness to its home in\nthe kingdom of infinite calmness, it is necessary to have correct pos-\nture--that is, a posture wherein the body is still and free from rest-\nlessness and the spine is erect. An erect spine allows the life energy\nand consciousness to flow freely from the lower centers of the senses,\nthrough the spine, to the higher centers of spiritual realization in the\nbrain.\n\nCONCENTRATE UPON ENDS Patanjali always points to the purpose of\nFOR WHICH DIFFERENT spiritual actions and tells the devotee not\nTECHNIQUES ARE USED to become identified with any process of\nsalvation but only to use that process until\n\nsalvation is attained. Patanjali warns the devotee not to be so en-\ngrossed with the process that he forgets the purpose for which that\nprocess or technique was prescribed. Many devotees remain within the\nconfinement of asana. They concentrate upon the physical gymnastics of\n\nHatha Yoga, enjoying the suppleness and mastery of the body that asana\nbrings, forgetting that the purpose of asana is to attain freedom of the\nmind and soul. Therefore, Patanjali does not prescribe lengthy concen-\ntration on the practice of various postures; but he says that any com-\nfortable posture in which the spine is erect, the body is steady and\nfairly restful, and the mind is peaceful, is the correct posture, or\nasana.\n\nFOURTH STEP: DISCONNECTING Stillness is the altar of Spirit and\nTHE MIND FROM THE SENSES BY Patanjali says that right posture is\nSWITCHING OFF THE LIFE FORCE necessary for stillness.

All scientific techniques that bring about union\nof soul and Spirit may be classified as yoga, and pranayama is the\ngreatest yogic method for attaining this divine union.\n\nSLEEP-- The state of sleep is unconscious pranayama, or the un-\n\nUNCONSCIOUS conscious process of switching off the life force from\n\nPRANAYAMA the five sense telephones. In sleep one practices the\nmortal posture or sSavasana. In this posture the body\n\nis still, the muscles have stopped working, venous blood is reduced, the\nheart slows down, the energy in the heart becomes quiet; therefore, the\nenergy from the five senses is switched off. Then the mind attains un-\nconscious pratyahara, or unconsciously returns within and becomes ab-\nsorbed in an unconscious state of peace. Patanjali's statement of the\ndirect use of pranayama is very significant, since he does not beat\nabout the bush but tells one to adopt that scientific measure by which\nsensations can be consciously disconnected from the mind.

Control of this life force\nmeans getting control of the force that binds you to the world. Without\ntraining in life-force control, pranayama, you can never go into deep\nsilence. It is useless to tell students to remain silent without their\nknowing first the methods by which they can control this life force.\n\nHolding the breath for a little while is all right because you oxy-\ngenate the system and purify your blood, but that is not control over\nyour breath. Pranayama does not mean just holding the breath in the\nlungs; it means control of the life force that activates the lungs and\nthe heart. If you can control the heart by pranayama, you can switch\noff the energy from any body function at will. If you know how to do\nthis, you can practice deep silence. Without that, you cannot know God.\nYou must have life-force control over your breath and heart.\n\nKKK\nAFFIRMATION\n\nO Father, when I was blind I found not a door which led to\nThee; but now that Thou hast opened my eyes, I find doors\neverywhere: through the hearts of flowers, through the voice of\nfriendship, through sweet memories of all lovely experiences.\nEvery gust of my prayer opens an unentered door in the vast\ntemple of Thy presence.\n\n"}

Kriya estab-\n\nlishes a continuous process of oxygenation that burns out the waste\ncarbon in the venous blood, thus obviating the necessity for the heart\nto pump venous blood through the lungs for this purpose. The heart is\nthus able to become quiet; as a result, the energy is switched off from\nthe five senses and the mind attains a conscious state of pratyahara, or\nawareness of inner forces.\n\nFIFTH STEP: MIND Pratyahara signifies the state of the mind when\nINTERIORIZATION it is disconnected from the five sense \"tele-\nBY PRATYAHARA phones.\" Those who practice pranayama or any\n\nother method of breath and life-energy control\nwithout bearing in mind the purpose for which they are practicing do not\nattain pratyahara. Patanjali states that the purpose of pranayama must\nbe pratyahara, or making the mind return within. All devotees who seek\nSelf-realization must be able to practice pranayama so successfully that\nthey can use it to attain pratyahara, or interiorization of the mind,\n\nimmediately. Thousands of students are satisfied with yama-niyama\n(rules of morality); many are satisfied with asana (posture); and some\nare satisfied with practicing pranayama alone. Best results come from\n\nthe practice of all three--yama-niyama, asana, and pranayama.\n\nCLIMBING TO THE KINGDOM There can be many steps to a comprehen-\nOF GOD--SAMADHI--ON THE Sive theological understanding of the laws\nSEVEN-STEP LADDER OF of God described in various philosophies\nSELF-REALIZATION and religions; there are but seven steps\non the ladder of Self-realization that\nlead to the actual perception of the Infinite.

Those who practice some form of meditation, or a prana-\nyama technique, have not arrived at the fifth step of the ladder of Self-\nrealization until they are able quickly to interiorize the mind (pratya-\nhara). Each step should yield definite signs of Self-realization.\n\n"}

Pranayama should yield heartbeat control, pulse con-\ntrol, awareness of the cool and warm life currents in\nthe spine, life-force control, and mind control.\n\nSTEP 5. Pratyahara yields freedom of mind from physical sensa-\ntions; it is the power of mental interiorization, or\nwithdrawal of the mind from the senses.\n\nSTEP 6.

The ultimate realization is\n\nsamadhi or complete union with God.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES Only after mastering pratyahara are dharana (con-\nRE: SIXTH STEP centration) and dhyana (meditation) possible. Many\n\npeople think it is easy to meditate, but true med-\nitation is actually impossible without first climbing the steps of yama-\nniyama, asana, pranayama, and pratyahara. Only those who have practiced\nthese five steps can control the body and moods and habits; and exercise\nthe ability to switch off the current from the five senses so that the\nattention, which is ordinarily tied to sensory experiences, is freed\nthrough pratyahara to go within and meditate on God.\n\nSuch a devotee has scientifically attained an expanded state of con-\nsciousness and understands what meditation means. Only by pratyahara,\nwhen the mind goes within, is it possible to concentrate completely upon\nGod. Otherwise the mind will be experiencing sensations and the thoughts\narising from them. Some spiritual teachers ask their students to medi-\ntate without explaining that meditation involves the achievement of one-\nness on the part of the meditator; the process of meditation, in which\nthe mind is withdrawn from the senses by interiorization; and the object\nof meditation (God).\n\nPatanjali says: \"Meditate upon God (Iswara).\" He understood that\nthe average person has no conception of God, and explains that the sym-\nbol of God is Aum, the Cosmic Vibration or Cosmic Sound. Patanjali took\nit for granted, however, that people would know the meaning of Aum. The\nUpanishads tell us that as oil flows continuously from a barrel, so does\nAum flow continuously from the cask of Spirit. It iS a cosmic sound, an\nall-permeating sound, somewhat like a bass voice or a continuously sound-\ning gong. Aum can be heard first in the body; then by dhyana, or ex-\npanded perception, it can be heard emanating from all creation. It is\nthe sound oozing out of all atomic vibrations.\n\nWhen Patanjali advises the yogi to concentrate on Aum, to chant Aum,\nand to understand the meaning of Aum, he means more than mere chanting\nof Aum aloud, or in a whisper, or mentally; rather that the yogi should\nengage the mind repeatedly upon the Aum sound that is emanating from\nCosmic Vibration, which is present in the body and can be heard within\nby the practice of certain techniques.

Those who chant Aum aloud, or ina\nwhisper, merely create a sound of their own through the voice and imagi-\nnation, and their consciousness of Aum is limited by that sound. But\none must strive to hear the real Aum sound that is going on in the cos-\nmos, which is unlimited, omnipresent, and omniscient--the Holy Ghost or\nvibration emanating from the transcendental God, the Father, and con-\ntaining as its guiding principle the Christ or omnipresent Intelligence.\n\nPatanjali says that in superconscious chanting the devotee keeps his\nattention riveted to the cosmic sound of Aum and tries to understand and\nfeel this vibration of Aum as the representative of God in every atom of\nthe universe. The Word (Cosmic Vibration) was made flesh (i.e., matter,\nthe physical body of God). Many people do not understand the signifi-\ncance of Patanjali's instruction to meditate on Aum, and go on chanting\nloudly without trying at the same time to feel the cosmic presence of\nthe real Aum sound. This Aum sound is the cosmic \"trumpet\" heard by St.\nJohn and described in the book of Revelation; it is the \"Amen,\" the\n\"faithful witness\" of the beginning of God's creation.\n\nPatanjali says that by superconscious chanting or inner perception\nof the Aum sound, and by thinking of the significance of Aum, one begins\nto identify his consciousness with Aum as heard in the body, and also\nwith Aum as expressed in the universe. When Patanjali instructs the\ndevotee to chant Aum, he means to listen to the Aum sound that is going\non in the temple of meditation. When he says, \"Think of its signifi-\ncance,\" he means, \"do not limit Aum by boundaries of your concentration\non the sound within the body; but try to feel Aum beyond the boundaries\nof the body, in all things, in eternity.\"\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES After dharana, or concentration, comes dhyana,\n\nRE: SEVENTH STEP which means attainment of the conception of the\nMagnitude of Aum. Dharana means meditation on\n\nAum with an interiorized mind. Arthabhabanam (thinking of the meaning\n\nof Aum) and dhyana (conception of the Aum sound as present in the body\nand in the cosmos) are the same thing, conceiving of the perception of\nAum not only in the body but also in the universe. By doing this, the\ndevotee attains sabikalpa samadhi; that is, he deliberately (not uncon-\nsciously, by diversion) forgets the wave of the body in order to concen-\ntrate upon the ocean of Spirit. In sabikalpa samadhi the devotee con-\ncentrates so that his consciousness of material things is completely\nobliterated, but he is supersensitively conscious of the Spirit within.\nSabikalpa samadhi has many forms.\n\nSAMADHI TAKES When the devotee becomes one with the cosmic sound\n\nMANY FORMS of Aum, that state is called Aum samadhi. When the\ndevotee is one with the cosmic life in this vibra-\n\ntion of Aum, that state is called mahaprana, or oneness with the cosmic\n\nlife force. In this samadhi the devotee is conscious of the cosmic vi-\ntal forces. When the devotee perceives cosmic light, that state is as-\ntral samadhi. In astral samadhi the devotee is one with the cosmic\n\nlight. Then comes ananda samadhi, or oneness with the cosmic joy in\n\n"}

Then comes\nsundara samadhi, wherein one becomes one with all glory and beauty in\nSpirit.\n\nIn sabikalpa samadhi, the devotee is conscious of these various man-\nifestations of God as sound, light, devotion, bliss, beauty, and so on,\nto the exclusion of the consciousness of the body and the world. After\nthe devotee attains sabikalpa samadhi, which means bodily immobility\ncombined with inner divine realizations, by further meditation he passes\nto the higher state of nirbikalpa samadhi.\n\nULTIMATE REALIZATION In nirbikalpa samadhi the soul becomes simul-\n\ntaneously conscious of the ocean of Spirit\nwith its manifesting waves--the body, the mind, and the soul.

Whether or not you understand the theory, if you conscientiously\npractice this supreme technique your all-accomplishing power of concen-\ntration will increase, as will your creative inspiration and ever new\nhappiness.\n\nHe who practices Kriya is a Kriya Yogi, a true Brahmin (\"knower of\nBrahma\" or God), a twice-born Christian. \"Except a man be born again,\nhe cannot see the kingdom of God\" (John 3:3). A Kriya Yogi is born\nagain by baptism in Spirit.\n\nPhysical birth is given by the father and mother; spiritual birth is\ngiven by the guru, the spiritual preceptor sent by God to awaken divine\nconsciousness in true seekers. The guru is he who is able to lead the\ndisciple, through a definite spiritual teaching and discipline, to God\nConsciousness. One may have many teachers, but when he finds his guru,\nhe should follow only that guru's teaching throughout life. A true guru\nis a vehicle of God, through whom the Heavenly Father teaches the devo-\ntees in order to recall them to Himself.\n\nHISTORICAL BASIS The evolution-quickening technique of Kriya is an\n\nancient science. Lahiri Mahasaya received it from\nhis guru, Babaji, who rediscovered and clarified the technique after it\nhad been lost in the Dark Ages. Babaji, a deathless avatar, lives se-\ncretly in the Himalayas with a band of highly advanced disciples. He\npossesses Christlike powers. At the time of imparting the technique of\nKriya to Lahiri Mahasaya, Babaji said:\n\n\"The Kriya Yoga that I am giving to the world through you\nin this nineteenth century is a revival of the same science that\nKrishna gave, millenniums ago, to Arjuna; and that was later\nknown to Patanjali; and to Christ and his disciples St. John,\nSt. Paul, and others.\"\n\nIt was to Swami Sri Yukteswar, one of Lahiri Mahasaya's most highly\nadvanced disciples, that I came, as a youth, for spiritual training.\nFrom Sri Yukteswarji I learned that Babaji has chosen me to bring Kriya\nYoga to the western world. Babaji knew that many truth-seekers in the\nWest would be receptive to the scientific approach to God as given by\nIndia's ancient science of Yoga. Thus it was that Kriya Yoga, an an-\ncient sacred technique, has been made available to the world, that the\ndevotee may learn the exact method by which he may expand the boundaries\nof his mental chalice to hold the ocean of omnipresent Christ Cconscious-\nness and Cosmic Consciousness.\n\n"}

So you must be true to yourself\nand to the Gurus of Self-Realization Fellowship by faithful practice of\nthe liberating soul-science. SRF is resolved to show you that Cosmic\nConsciousness is attainable in one lifetime if you properly and continu-\nously cooperate in this divine endeavor.\n\nYour fervent prayer for a new life, filled with the happiness that\nis the birthright of every soul, is answered by these Kriya lessons.\nWith proper and persistent practice of these principles and techniques,\nthe devotee may attain the supreme goal of Self-realization. That goal\nwas reached by Lahiri Mahasaya, who toiled in the world, but remained\nanchored in the Infinite Bliss; as well as by many other determined\nKriya Yogis.\n\nKRIYA IS THE Man's consciousness is ordinarily identified\nINITIATION INTO with the senses. By Kriya practice the con-\nCOSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS sciousness is transferred to the spine and\n\nbrain and thus transmuted into superconscious-\nness and ultimately into Cosmic Consciousness. Through the faithful\npractice of Kriya you may contact Christ and other prophets and masters,\nand through them find union with God, the Infinite Spirit.\n\nIn your search for God through past incarnations you may have passed\nthrough states of worshiping idols or other material symbols, and may\nhave..pursued.many paths of blind belief. But at last you see that the\nhighest truth actually is to be found only within yourself. At last,\nperhaps after aeons, you have been led to a guru who can show you how to\nfind God within yourself, in the centers of life force and consciousness\nin the spine. This great initiation is given to you so that by Kriya\nYoga you may awaken the divine consciousness in the spine and create\nthere an altar of God-perception. Then you will understand that al-\nthough God dwells even in restless and changeable material forms, He is\nto be found in the greatest measure within yourself, in the calm still-\nness of your eternal soul. Worship God on the altar of the spine; then\nyou will behold Him in the temple of every thought, every activity.\n\nJust imagining that you are in Cosmic Consciousness does not make it\ntrue; you are still bound to the consciousness of flesh. But when you\ndisconnect your mind from the senses through the Kriya Technique the\nthread of mortal or bodily consciousness is temporarily cut; your con-\nsciousness becomes attuned to centers of higher perceptions in the\nspine. When a certain blissful sensation (to be described in detail\nlater) is felt in the spine, currents of life energy are withdrawn from\nthe sensory nerves and concentrated in the spine, producing perfect sen-\nsory relaxation. By practice of this technique the yogi may control\nsensory perception as simply as one turns on and off a light switch.\n\nThe yogi does not lose consciousness in switching off the senses; he may\n\"turn on\" the sensory perceptions again at will.\n\nJesus said: \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he\ncannot enter into the kingdom of God\" (John 3:5).

That is why in India\nthe higher castes are called \"twice-born\" (dvija). \"Twice-born\" refers to @\nthe second birth or the attainment of higher states of consciousness in\n\nthe spine. This awakening is the baptism by Spirit, the true initiation.\n\nConscious life is marked by restlessness. Even when you are think-\ning your mind is only partially active in the brain; the mind remains\nchiefly concentrated on the body and the senses, which continue to re-\nport bodily sensations to the brain. Consciousness functions strongly\nin the tongue when you are tasting food; in the skin when you are aware\nof heat or cold; in the eardrum when you are hearing sounds; in the nos-\ntrils when you are smelling odors; and in the retina when you are seeing\n\nobjects. When your feeling is moved, your heart is the center of aware-\nness; when you are expressing will power, your mind is concentrated at\nthe point between the eyebrows (the center of will), and in muscular\n\nmovements.\n\nIn sleep, however, the consciousness and energy are centered in the\nvital organs and the spine rather than in the sensory nerves and the\nmuscles. The state of sleep is marked by peacefulness felt subcon-\nsciously. However, when consciousness and energy are withdrawn from the\nsensory nerves and muscles into the spine by Kriya meditation, the yogi\nconsciously enjoys a state of calm awareness and peace.\n\nThe purpose of Kriya is to magnetize the spine by circulating life\ncurrent lengthwise around it, thereby withdrawing life current temporar-\nily from the sensory nerves and involuntary organs, and concentrating it\nin the centers of life and consciousness in the spine. This practice\nhelps to effect a permanent change in the center of consciousness, lib-\nerating it from preoccupation with the mortal body and establishing the\nmind on the spinal altar of eternal spiritual consciousness.\n\nSpine and brain are the insulated altars whereon the divine elec-\ntricity of life first comes to rest when it descends into the body.\nFrom seven cerebrospinal centers the life force branches out into the\nsensory nerves, keeping the soul busy with material perceptions. By the\npractice of Kriya, consciousness and energy again become centralized in\nthe spine; the yogi feels there a boundless ever-new joy, proof of the\npresence within him of the Divine. ः\n\nPRANA MEANS The Sanskrit term for life energy is prana. Its point of\nLIFE ENERGY entry and principal seat in the human body is the medulla\noblongata. There are two kinds of prana:\n\n(a) cosmic energy, the source of all living things;\n(b) the specific prana or energy pervading each human body.\n\nCosmic energy is the cause of the creation of planets and of all\nliving organisms. The life energy in the bodies of all organisms is\nsecretly supplied from cosmic energy. But this divine supply is dimin-\nished as the life energy in man becomes more and more individualized,\nselfish, and body-bound, ignorant of its universal connection.\n\n"}

Cosmic\n\nConsciousness, Spirit, Brahma, the Absolute, all are one and the same.\n\nEven when creation was not, Spirit was. Creation has beginning and\nend and is subject to categories of time, space, relativity, dimension,\ncause and effect; whereas Spirit is beyond all categories--beginningless,\nendless, changeless, unconditioned. All the conditions of existence as\nwe understand it are contained in Spirit, yet It is unaffected by them.\n\nSpirit is Self-born. Spirit is ever conscious; its attention is\nequally distributed everywhere, and is fully concentrated everywhere.\nWe also, being made in the image of Spirit, have latent within us the\npower to concentrate our attention and to feel our existence everywhere,\nthrough attunement of our consciousness with the cosmic or all-pervading\n\nconsciousness of Spirit. Actually our human consciousness is Cosmic\nConsciousness, bottled up in a phial of flesh, corked with ignorance,\nand floating isolated in the ocean of Spirit. Because of maya, the cos-\n\nmic delusion, this bottled-up human consciousness, although living and\nmoving in Spirit, cannot contact Spirit, just as salt water that is\ncorked in a bottle and floating on the sea cannot. contact the sea.\n\nCosmic Consciousness is spread all over the universe and pervades\neverything in it. Human consciousness is limited by the human body and\nits environment. To attain Cosmic Consciousness it is necessary to ex-\npand the consciousness that resides in every living cell of the body and\nbrain. Through following proper laws of living and by faithful practice\nof Kriya Yoga man can thus enlarge his consciousness and receive the\nocean of Cosmic Consciousness, or Spirit.\n\nCorrect practice of the Kriya Technique will bring you to the Source\nof all creative inspiration. By opening the spiritual eye of intuitive\nknowledge it will give you answers to all your questions. Kriya prac-\ntice clears and stimulates the brain and strengthens the medulla oblon-\ngata; it also greatly magnetizes the body, saturating and feeding all\nits physical cells with undecaying light and keeping them in a magne-\ntized state.\n\nThe deep student of Self-Realization Fellowship is able to live more\nby the \"word of God,\" or cosmic energy, and less by the bread of life--\noxygen, sunshine, and solid and liquid foods. As the life current is\ncirculated up and down in the spine, the Kriya yogi experiences higher\n\n"}

When body consciousness is\nshut off by Kriya (duplicating consciously the freedom from body con-\nsciousness experienced in the state of sleep), the yogi becomes aware of\nthe subtle spinal centers of light and energy.\n\nWhen you can withdraw the energy from the senses, you can place your\nmind upon God, and you are then ready for the practice of Kriya. Con-\ntrol of life force produces a conscious state of deep silence. In sleep\nyou experience complete silence. Why? Because the energy is withdrawn\nfrom the eyes and all the senses.\n\nKriya Yoga and its variations are exercises in the control of\nprana--life force--and are not ordinary breathing exercises. The Kriya\nTechnique has been practiced by many students of Self-Realization Fel-\nlowship with the greatest benefit to their spiritual, mental, and moral\ngrowth.\n\nYour soul is seeking an experience of God that is tangible. The\nKriya Technique will give you mathematical results according to how\nmuch, how deeply, and how exactly you practice. The sincere Kriya yogi\nwill find also that when he experiences occasional states of spiritual\nstagnation, he can receive immediate help by the practice of Kriya.\n\nTwenty-four hours of ordinary silence will not produce as much spir-\nitual benefit as one hour of deep meditation, and the Kriya Yoga Tech-\n—@ षि more results in daily practice than twenty-four hours of\nordinary meditation. The Kriya Yoga that my master Sri Yukteswar taught\nis the greatest of pranayama techniques.\n\nYou can be sure that each time you practice Kriya correctly your en-\ntire system is being divinely changed; that your brain power and mental\nreceptivity are expanding. You will come to realize that in the sacred\ntechnique of Kriya Yoga the masters of India have given you everything\nyou need to reach the supreme Goal of life. The time limitation of or-\ndinary human evolution is overcome by Kriya practice. The attainment of\nwisdom and Self-realization, which ordinarily requires a million years\nof normal, diseaseless evolution, is possible, through deep devotion and\nright practice of Kriya, in one lifetime. The human brain may be per-\nfected sufficiently, by Kriya, to express Cosmic Consciousness, which\notherwise might require many more irksome human incarnations to achieve.\n\nKriya is a fundamental method. The Kriya yogi mentally directs his\nlife energy to revolve, upward and downward, around the sensitive spinal\ncord. The spine becomes magnetized; the life force, instead of being\n\nwasted and abused in the senses, is constrained to reunite with subtler\nspinal energies. By such reinforcement of life force the advanced stu-\ndent of Self-realization hastens physical and mental regeneration and\nrejuvenation. His body and brain cells are electrified with the spiri-\ntual elixir. Specifically, the Kriya Technique transfers the attention\n| । from the sensations of sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch to the\nSpine and brain where, by the intuitive perception of the soul, the yogi\nperceives God reigning in all His glory.

But when the yogi returns the @\nlife force to the spine by Kriya practice and becomes concentrated\n\nsolely on the subtle spinal perceptions, he is blissfully unaware of the\n\nbody, his consciousness having become established once again on the\n\nspinal altar whereon he is aware only of his soul and God.\n\nQUICKENING The evolutionary progress of the human body, mind,\nSOUL EVOLUTION and soul keeps pace with the revolutions of the\nearth around the sun. (This natural progress is re-\n\ntarded if disease, accidents, undue despondency, ignorance, or sense at-\ntachment be permitted to invade the threefold kingdom of body, mind, and\n\nsoul.) The six spinal centers (medullary, cervical, dorsal, lumbar,\nsacral, and coccygeal plexuses) in man correspond to the twelve astral\nSigns of the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man. The astral system of a\n\nhuman being, with six (twelve by polarity) inner constellations revolving\naround the sun of the omniscient spiritual eye, is interrelated with the\nphysical sun and the twelve zodiacal signs. The great yogis of India\ndiscovered that man's earthly and heavenly environment, in twelve-year\ncycles, push him forward on his natural path of evolution.\n\nBut although the outer influences of rays and vibrations, food and\nsolar energy, do refine the mind in this twelve-year period, the spiri-\n\ntual progress is nevertheless very slight. Calculated according to\nthese twelve-year cycles, one million years would be required for a hu-\nman being to attain Cosmic Consciousness. The ancient rishis therefore\n\nset about finding a way to attain Cosmic Consciousness in one lifetime.\nThey discovered that to effect a change in the brain by means of refine-\nment of the physical brain cells is a slow process, but that the effect\non man of brain-changes is immediate. They concentrated therefore on\ndeveloping a method of hastening the evolution of the brain.\n\nThey found that what is accomplished by outer influences during or-\ndinary evolution could be brought about by internal methods of prana-\nyama, or life-force control, that energize the sensitive spinal centers\nand render them receptive to spiritual currents. The rishis developed a\ntechnique of revolving the life force (the source of physical energy in\nthe body) in an elliptical path upward and downward around the six\nspinal centers, thus directly quickening the evolution of the spine and\nbrain centers. This quickening of evolution can be accomplished by\nfaithful practice of Kriya Yoga, provided the body is kept free from\ndiseases and accidents, and the mind free from disbelief and error.\n\nBy revolving the life force once around the spine, as the Kriya yogi\nis taught to do, man can effect a change in the brain and body that is\nordinarily possible only by one year of diseaseless existence, careful\neating, and absorption of solar energy. The passing of this current\nonce around the spine corresponds to the effect of 365 days of sunlight.\nSo any time the life current revolves around the spine, human evolution\nis advanced by one solar year.\n\nBy understanding the theory of Kriya Yoga, as explained in Kriya\nLessons 1-2-3-4, the student will receive more benefit from the actual\n"}

When we speak of Spirit as the Creative Princi-\nple, or God, that does not get us anywhere. Spirit, in order to be\nreal, must be real to us in a definite way. To describe Spirit nega-\ntively, saying that He--God--is neither mind, nor intelligence, concep-\ntion nor cognition, sense perception nor thoughts, sky nor earth, ego\nnor chitta (feelings), does not describe Him. By the negative method it\nis impossible to explain God. He is beyond conception, but that does\nnot prove that He is not in conception, for if God is not in it too, He\nwould not be omnipresent.\n\nIf we are made in the image of God, why do we not reflect Him? We\nare in God, surrounded by God, God is within us, yet why do we not feel\nHim? There are several reasons. One is, because our attention is di-\nrected to the limitations of flesh and earthly things, with which we\nhave identified ourselves.\n\nAs the sun reflects itself in many bodies of water, so the one\nSpirit reflects in many souls. Or, rather, this one Spirit is reflected\nin us as souls.

There should be no deviation from\nany of the instructions given in this initiation. The rules are few; obey them\nstrictly.\n\nChoose for your meditation seat a straight, armless chair (or a firm bed)\nover which a woolen blanket has been placed so that it runs down under the\nfeet, providing insulation from earth currents. Face East, the direction from\nwhich helpful subtle solar currents are always flowing.\n\nSit correctly with spine erect; feet flat on the floor; chin parallel to the\nground; inside edges of the shoulder blades as close together as possible;\nchest out; abdomen in; hands (with palms upturned) resting on the thighs where\nthey join the abdominal region. There should be no feeling of tension in main-\ntaining the correct erect meditation posture; the muscles and limbs should be\nrelaxed. But if you unconsciously allow the spine to bend forward (owing to\nbad postural habits of the past) you should straighten the spine as often as it\nbends, in order to gain the best results from Kriya practice.\n\nSPECIAL PREPARATION FOR KRIYA PRACTICE\n\n1. Lubricate the throat with a few drops of olive oil or melted unsalted but-\nter or any vegetable oil. Place the oil on the tongue; then let it trickle\nslowly down the throat.\n\n2. The following preliminary exercise gives an idea of the soothing warm\nand cool sensations that the student will experience when circulating the\nlife energy in the spine during actual Kriya practice.\n\nPRELIMINARY EXERCISE\n\nClench each fist lightly so as to form a small tubelike hollow. Hold the\nthumb-end of the right fist against the little-finger end of the left fist; then\nplace the left fist against the open mouth (as though the two fists were a hol-\nlow flute-like tube held to the lips for blowing).\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 1323, "text": "K-5 3\n\nSlowly inhale through the mouth, drawing in air through the tube created\nby the loosely clenched fists. Notice the cool, refreshing sensation within the\nfists as the air passes through. Then exhale (through the mouth), giving care-\nful attention to the sensation of trickling warmth felt inside the fist-formed\ntube. These two sensations (of coolness and warmth) will be felt in the spine\nduring practice of the actual technique of Kriya Yoga.\n\nRepeat several times the inhalation and exhalation of the breath through\nthe fists, concentrating on the alternating sensations of coolness and warmth\nas the breath is inhaled and exhaled.\n\nContinue inhaling and exhaling, but mentally transfer the sensations of\ncoolness and warmth to the throat, taking the fists away from the mouth and\nletting the relaxed hands rest palms upward on the legs where the thighs join\nthe abdominal region. Go on inhaling and exhaling, and mentally transfer to\nthe spine the sensations of coolness and warmth felt inthe throat. This lat-\nter transition of attention and feeling is not difficult, as the spine is directly\nbehind the throat. The initial concentration on mentally transferring the sen-\nsations of coolness and warmth from the fists to the throat to the spine is in-\ntended to stimulate the movement of the actual life-energy currents in the\nSpine. When, through the practice of Kriya Yoga, you begin to feel the alter-\nnately cool and warm currents in the spine, these currents will be the object\nof your concentration.\n\nThe foregoing exercise with the fist-formed tube is not the actual tech-\nnique of Kriya. Its practice may be dispensed with once the student becomes\nproficient in the practice of the actual Kriya Yoga technique.\n\nVISUALIZE THE SPINE AS A HOLLOW TUBE\n\nNow visualize the spinal column as a hollow tube extending upward from\nthe base of the spine (coccyx) to the base of the brain (medulla oblongata),\nwhere it bends forward in an arc extending through the cerebrum and ending\nat the Christ Consciousness center between the eyebrows. The practice of\nKriya Yoga enables the student to feel the life force ascending (with a cool,\nsoothing sensation), and descending (with a warm, trickling sensation) within\nthis imaginary hollow cerebrospinal tube.\n\nTECHNIQUE OF KRIYA YOGA\n\nWith eyelids half closed, or completely closed, turn the eyeballs upward\nand fix the gaze, without strain, at the point between the eyebrows.\n\nEXPAND THE THROAT\n\nExpand the inner opening of the throat by rolling the tongue back toward\nthe palate as far as possible.

Let the tongue return\nto normal position, but retain the expansion of the throat that results from\nturning the tongue backward.\n\nINHALATION (FEELING ASCENDING CURRENT)\n\nNow inhale calmly and slowly, through the mouth and nose simultaneously,\nmaking the barely audible sound of ''AW'' deep in the expanded throat. During\ninhalation of the breath the sound should be continuous, \"AAAWWW'\"' (not jerki-\nly made, i.e., not 'AW, AW,AW''). The duration of one inhalation should be\nten (or up to fifteen) counts. (When done correctly the inhaling breath will have\nan aspirated ''AW\" sound, and will produce a cool sensation deep in the throat. )\n\nImagine that the breath is ascending quietly and smoothly through the in-\nSide of the imaginary hollow cerebrospinal canal (rather than going in and out\nof the lungs). As you draw in the breath, feel the coolness in the throat, and\nconcentrate on the sound of ''AW,'' and mentally transfer both the sensation of\ncoolness and the sound of 'AW'' to the spine. Feel that the cool breath is ris-\ning from the coccyx at the base of the spine with a sound of 'AW, '' and that it\nis moving upward through the spine to the medulla, from there arching for-\nward through the cerebrum until it reaches the top of the imaginary cerebro-\nspinal tube, at the point between the eyebrows (the Christ Consciousness cen-\nter). Feel this ascent of the breath in the spine as a cool sensation (similar\nto that produced when you drew in breath through the clenched fists ).\n\nThe first part of Kriya, then, consists in the following:\n\nInhale calmly and slowly (to acount of ten or up to fifteen) making the aspi-\nrated sound of ''AW'' deep in the expanded throat, but feeling that the breath is\na cool current that you are drawing up the spine through a hollow tube from\nthe coccyx to the Christ Consciousness center with a sound of 'AW.\"'\n\nHaving drawn the cool current up to the Christ Consciousness center,\npause briefly; a count of three should be long enough.\n\nEXHALATION (FEELING DESCENDING CURRENT)\n\nSlowly exhale through mouth and nose to a count of ten (or up to fifteen),\nmaking the barely audible, continuous aspirated sound of \"EEEEE\" high in the\nexpanded throat. Feel that the breath is a tepidly warm, trickling stream\nflowing back through the hollow tube from the Christ Center through the cere-\nbrum to the medulla oblongata; and soothingly flowing downward through the\nspine to the coccyx. Feel the warmth in the throat, and concentrate on the\nsound of \"EE, \" and mentally transfer both the sensation of warmth and the\nsound of \"EE' to the spine, imagining the warm breath to be going down through\nthe spine with the fine sound of \"EE.\" | |\n\nOne ''Kriya' means one practice of inhalation and exhalation of the breath\nin the spine (as just described).

Extra oxygen is\ntaken into the body during the special breathing that accompanies prac-\ntice of the Kriya technique. That extra oxygen becomes transmuted into\nlife force. Continuously ascending and descending in the spine, the\nlife force creates a dynamo of energy that, like a magnet, attracts into\nthe spine certain currents of life energy from the sensory nerves. The\nmind, thus disconnected from bodily sensations, is able to transfer its\ncenter of consciousness from the physical body to the spinal altar of\nGod. By disconnecting the sensory perceptions of the limited territory\nof matter, the yogi becomes aware, through subtle spinal perceptions, of\nthe unlimited sphere of Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nPURPOSE OF Maha Mudra consists of the practice of Kriya Yoga ina\nMAHA MUDRA certain pose (described below). Maha Mudra is a simple\nbut immensely effective method for straightening the\nspine and for encouraging the right distribution of prana (life cur-\nrents) along the spine. Correct practice of Maha Mudra equalizes the\nflow of life energy to all parts of the body. It should be performed\nthree times in the morning and three times in the evening, just before\nyour regular practice of fourteen Kriyas. (However, because of the ef-\nfectiveness of Maha Mudra in magnetizing and adjusting the spine, this\ntechnique may be practiced at any time the body requires adjustment.)\n\nPREPARATION Since the practice of Maha Mudra involves also the\npractice of Kriya proper (which instruction you have\nalready received, in Lesson K-5), make preparations as you would for\n\nKriya, lubricating the throat with a few drops of olive oil or melted\nunsalted butter or vegetable oil.\n\nSpread a woolen blanket on the floor or on a hard bed that does not\nsag.\n\n"}

The purpose of practicing\n\nJyoti Mudra is to see the light of the single eye, by\none's own effort, and to find through this spiritual eye the guidance of\nthe omnipresent, omniscient Christ Consciousness. Seeing the spiritual\neye is not accomplished through suggestion; it is an actual experience.\nWhen the yogi's mind and eyes are calmed and concentrated one-pointedly\nat the Christ-consciousness center between the eyebrows, he beholds\nthere the light of the single eye. Jyoti Mudra gives you this spiritual\nbaptism of light.\n\nOur flesh is nothing more than condensed electricity. Beholding the\nlight of the spiritual eye of infallible intuition you will understand\nwhat Jesus meant when he said, \"The light of the body is the eye: there-\nfore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light...\nTake heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness\"\n(Luke 11:34,35).\n\nThe purpose of Jyoti Mudra is to prevent the escape of life force\nthrough the head-openings of ears, nose, and mouth; and to use the \"cap-\ntured\" life force to illuminate the single eye. But in order to get\nresults you must follow steadfastly on the path of Self-Realization,\npracticing all the meditation techniques faithfully and with devotion.\n\nBefore practicing Jyoti Mudra, offer the following prayer:\n\n\"Heavenly Father, guide me with Thy wisdom through the star in\nthe spiritual eye. May my consciousness follow to its Source\nthe dove of light descending from heaven, that I be baptized in\nChrist Consciousness. Heavenly Father, show me always the sin-\ngle eye; meet me always through the spiritual eye.\"\n\nTECHNIQUE OF JYOTI MUDRA\n(See Fig. 7 on Sheet of Illustrations, Lesson Kriya 6-A.)\n\nSit in the meditation posture: spine erect; feet flat on the floor;\nchin parallel to the ground; inside edges of shoulder blades as close\ntogether as possible; chest out; abdomen in.\n\nPut the thumb of the left hand lightly over the tragus of the left\near, and the thumb of the right hand lightly over the tragus of the\nright ear. (The tragus is the fleshy prominence in front of the opening\nor hole in the ear.)\n\nPlace the index finger of each hand lightly, but with a gentle pres-\nsure, over the outer corners of the closed eyelids.\n\nPlace the middle fingers on the sides of the nose, near the nostrils. | ।\n"}

Perform\nJyoti Mudra three times after your morning practice of fourteen Kriyas,\nand three times in the evening, after your evening practice of fourteen\nKriyas.\n\nTHE TELESCOPIC DOORWAY In the beginning the spiritual eye may\nTO COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS appear differently to different people;\nbut when it is seen perfectly, it will\nappear (as described in earlier lessons) as a star in the center of a\nblue sphere that is encircled by a golden halo. The outer golden halo\nrepresents in terms of astral color the vibration of the Cosmic Energy\nor Holy Ghost; the blue sphere represents the vibration of the Christ\nConsciousness that pervades all creation. To penetrate the blue disc\nis to enter the telescopic doorway to Christ Consciousness. The little\nwhite star in the middle represents that pure light of God beyond cre-\nation; the yogi who penetrates the star enters Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nWe know from the Bible that the wise men followed the \"star of the\nFast\" to find the Christ child. Each was following the star in his own\nspiritual eye. You also may learn to see and to follow the star of the\nspiritual eye, through whose universal sight the wise men were able to\nperceive Christ Consciousness manifesting in a human form--that of the\nlittle baby Jesus. Unless a person takes his consciousness through the\nspiritual eye, he cannot possess Christ Consciousness.\n\nThe human body is an externalization of the powers within the little\nfive-pointed star in the spiritual eye. Man's head, two hands, and two\nfeet are symbolized in the five rays of the star in the spiritual eye.\nThese rays have materialized into the five elements (ether, air, fire,\nwater, and earth) of which the human body is composed.\n"}

We must work with Him, rejoice with Him, serve with Him, and\nbehold Him in every object and in every person we meet.

Tf you have not\ndone so, delay no longer. Sanctify this temple by devoting it exclu-\nSively to the practice of Self-Realization Fellowship techniques, espe-\ncially Kriya Yoga.

Progressing logically and scientifically in his\nunderstanding of the true laws of yoga, he may attain the pinnacle of\nSelf-realization. Kriya is the scientific way of changing material\nbody-consciousness into spiritual Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nKriya is mathematical in its results. All who practice it correctly\nand regularly will learn this truth for themselves. By the correct\nmorning and evening practice of Kriya, the spine, brain, and mind become\nbeneficially changed or spiritualized. It requires one year to bring\nabout through natural evolution a change equivalent to that produced by\none completed Kriya breath. By practicing Kriya twenty-four times\ndaily, the devotee may achieve in one day the equivalent of twenty-four\nyears of natural spiritual evolution.\n\nAfter practicing Kriya and resting for a time in the inner peace\nthat comes from meditation, one is better fitted to do creative work in\nconnection with literature, art, or science. Stimulated by Kriya, intu-\nition develops of itself, without effort, because one's consciousness is\nthen transferred from the outward senses inward to the spine and brain.\nSelf-realization can come only through the development of one's intu-\nition. While practicing Kriya, feel the power of God in the spine.\nThrough regular, deep practice of the Kriya Technique you will contact\nChrist and the other great Gurus of this path, and they will help you to\nattain union with God, the Infinite Spirit.\n\nAs a child just learning to walk must walk slowly before learning to @\nrun, so it is with Kriya.

If for some reason you are unable to\nprecede your Kriya practice with the complete routine of SRF Re-\ncharging Exercises given in Lesson 8-A (these take about fifteen\nminutes), the three following exercises may be practiced in their\nstead.\n\nExercise A:\nStand erect, with shoulder blades together, chest out, chin up,\nhands down at the sides. Exhale slowly, dropping the head on\nthe chest, and bend forward at the waist until the hands touch\nthe floor. Then inhale, slowly straightening the body, at the\nsame time raising the arms upward over the head and bending the\nbody backward with head and hands as far back as you can\nstretch. Hold breath to a comfortable count. Then exhale\nslowly, repeating the exercise. Practice this three times.\nExercise B:\nThis exercise should be performed in bare feet before an open\n\nwindow. Stand erect, with shoulders back, chest out, chin up.\nRaise the hands and feet up and down in alternate succession, as\nin ordinary walking, while remaining in one place. Practice\n\nthis walking exercise for three minutes or longer.\n\nExercise C:\nPractice Exercise B at a moderate running gait for one minute or\nlonger.\n\n(2) Eat very little or no meat; never beef or pork. Include in your\ndiet plenty of fruits, raw vegetables, and ground nuts.\n\n(3) Never practice Kriya on a full stomach. Practice before meals, or\nat least three hours after meals. Partial fasting (on fruit juice,\nfor a day), is beneficial and effective in cleansing the body of\nrestlessness-producing toxins. Naturally one should fast only with\nthe approval of his or her physician.\n\nIf you cannot arrange your time so as to practice Kriya either be-\nfore or at least three hours after eating, then practice not more\nthan six Kriyas at one time.\n\n(4) Practice the Kriya Technique mentally only if you have a heart ail-\nment or a respiratory difficulty (even if it is just a cold), or if\nyou are having any serious, temporary physical health problem.

The benefits\nof Kriya will be enhanced by the practice of even-mindedness and the\navoidance of excessive excitement or emotionalism, wrong habits of\ndiet, and so on. Observe strict moderation in everything, particu-\nlarly in sex life. Self-control strengthens the mind and life force\nand brings happiness and peace of mind.\n\nDo not discuss or divulge any technique without first consulting\nwith SRF headquarters, which reserves the sole right to give Kriya\ninstruction, or to appoint a qualified SRF member to give such in-\nstruction.

The initial concentration on the idea of transferring the sensation\nand sound from the throat to the spine is practiced merely to stim-\nulate the movement of the actual currents of life-energy in the\nspine.

Then\nyou are ready to begin your Kriya practice.\n\n2. Before starting Kriya, make a loose fist with each hand. Hold the\ntwo fists close together, with the thumb of one hand pressed against\nthe little finger of the other, to create a hollow tube like a shep-\nherd's pipe. Place the fist nearest you to the lips as though to\n\"play\" the \"pipe.\" Inhale through the mouth and feel the sensation\nof coolness inside the hollow tube of the fists. Exhale (through\nthe mouth), and feel inside the fists the sensation of warmth. Prac-\ntice this several times, concentrating on the alternating sensations\nof coolness and warmth as the breath is inhaled and exhaled. Quickly\ntransfer this sensation to the throat, taking the fists away from\nthe mouth and letting the relaxed hands rest palms upward on the\nlegs at the juncture of the thighs with the abdominal region. From\nthe throat, transfer the sensation felt in the throat to the spine;\nthis is not difficult, as the upper part of the spine is directly\nbehind the throat. At first, breathe quickly a few times, feeling\nthe current moving a short distance up and down the spine in the re-\ngion of the throat; gradually, breathe more and more slowly, and\nfeel the currents going farther up and down the spine. Finally,\nbreathe the full Kriya count, feeling the currents flowing all the\nway from the coccyx to the Christ Consciousness center, and back\nagain. (Don't break the transition of sensation from fists to\nthroat to spine. The transitions should be smooth, flowing, unbroken.) | ।\n\n"}

However, once the\nmeditator has succeeded in keeping the eyes fixed in their upturned\ngaze at the Christ Consciousness center, it does not matter whether\nthe eyelids are half-closed or completely closed.\n\nUse a little olive oil, or unsalted butter, or any vegetable oil to\nlubricate the throat.

The various currents of life energy in\nthe body, freed from the limiting necessity of supplying the heart, lungs, and\nother organs, mingle and become identified with the subtle currents in the\nspine and finally become transmuted into cosmic energy. This is what is\nmeant by pranayama, or control of life force in the heart, spine, and nervous\nsystem. Pranayama results in breathlessness, which calms the heart and\nlungs and which is favorable for one's longevity. Inthe breathless state the\nlife force, which ordinarily is dependent on oxygen for its manifestation and\nperpetuation in the human body, finds freedom from its slavery to the breath\n(1. €. , oxygen) and moves Spiritward.

The opposite is true: control of breath is\na result of controlling the life force. The real meaning of pranayama, accord-\ning to Patanjali, foremost exponent of Yoga, is the gradual, unforced cessa-\ntion of breathing. The discontinuance of inhalation and exhalation can be\nbrought about by Kriya Yoga, a form of pranayama wherein the human blood\nis decarbonized and recharged with oxygen; the atoms of this extra oxygen are\n\n"}

The liberating re-\nsult for the devotee is less need for breath.\n\nIN TIME KRIYA TECHNIQUE BURNS The continuous, regulated breathing\nOUT ALL CARBON FROM THE BLOOD practiced in the technique of Kriya\n\nremoves the last residue of waste\ncarbon occasioned by the activities of breathing and blood circulation.\nThe venous blood, thus cleansed of dark impurities, ceases to flow to\nthe lungs for purification. Hence the heart and the lungs are given an\nextraordinary rest.\n\nThe inactivity of the muscles and limbs during meditation, by | ।\ngreatly lessening bodily carbon production, also is conducive to this\nrestful state of the heart and lungs.\n\n"}

The thoughts\nin his subconscious mind remain dormant. Real concentration consists in\n\nthe conscious withdrawal of the mind from outer distractions and from\nbody consciousness, and in the focusing of the attention on a single ob-\nject of thought. Such concentration may be accomplished scientifically\nby the practice of Kriya Yoga. By the stilling of muscular activity and\nby the decrease in activity of the heart and other internal organs, the\nKriya yogi is able to switch off the life force from the five sense\ntelephones.\n\nThe heart is the central switchboard connecting the five sense tele-\nphones with the brain. When the heart action slows down or stops com-\npletely during Kriya Yoga practice, the devotee becomes aware that life\nenergy has been automatically switched off from his five senses; it is\nthen impossible for perceptions of sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell\nto enter his brain and thus to divert his attention by rousing past mem-\nories or by instigating new streams of thoughts.

The joy felt in this\nstate is ever increasing, ever new. The Kriya yogi realizes (temporar-\nily at first, then permanently) that by attaining superconsciousness he\nhas passed beyond the need for nightly rejuvenation by sleep.\n\nMOST PEOPLE REALLY The average life span of man is about\n\"LIVE\" ONLY FIVE YEARS sixty years. We may safely surmise that\n\nhalf of that time (or a total of thirty\nyears) is spent in sleeping and eating; and that a total of approxi-\nmately fifteen years is spent in making a living. This cuts down the\n\"lifetime\" of modern man to fifteen years, of which five are probably\nwasted in talking about other people; and another five may easily slip\nby in absentminded, unproductive pursuits. Since the purpose of life is\nto find God, man may be said not really to \"live\" even the five remain-\ning years, unless he passes that time in Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nIt is necessary that every man fulfill his destined role in the\ndrama of life, carrying his share of earthly duties and responsibili-\n\nties. But his leisure time may be spent as he chooses, and his spiri-\ntual duty then is to seek God, to strive to express his soul possibili-\nties. How may this ideal be accomplished in thirty years' time\n\n(assuming that at least thirty years are usually lost in sleep and fool-\nishness)? The rishis calculated that even under ideal conditions it\nwould normally take one million years of right living in body and mind\nbefore man could become a fit instrument to express Cosmic Conscious-\nness. The rishis therefore sought, and found, a method of hastening\nbrain evolution.\n\nOne cannot imagine knowing the meaning of all the words in the dic-\ntionary. Yet the entire four Vedas--those ponderous Hindu scriptures--\nwere originally contained only in the minds of the great rishis of In-\ndia, and were handed down by them for centuries by word of mouth. To\nexpress Cosmic Consciousness is to embrace the knowledge of everything\ncontained in the united kingdom of God, on the pages of heaven and\nearth, in nature, and in human life. How may one so expand his mental\ncapacity as to receive that knowledge within a single lifetime? THROUGH\nTHE FAITHFUL PRACTICE OF KRIYA YOGA.\n\nत\n\nREALIZE THE POWER OF GOD WITHIN YOU\n\nTry to realize the powers that are playing, like searchlights,\nwithin you! You can be a master only when you realize this power. You\nmust persist with determined thoughts, so that you may realize that you\nare a child of God. When you realize that, you are saved. You must\nseek wisdom and power and prosperity from God. If you prefer to satisfy\nMaterial desires rather than seek God, that is a travesty of life's true\npurpose, a grave error of judgment. Do not strive for unimportant\nthings and reject the all-satisfying God.\n\n"}

Each time you review a lesson you\n\nmay discover something that escaped you in your previous study, or a\npoint whose importance may not have sufficiently impressed you before.\nIt is through repetition that we learn the most.\n\nINSPIRATION OF The ladder of the spine is the only way of true as-\nKRIYA STEP cension, or upliftment, into Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nPhysical and mental rejuvenation through adherence\nto harmonious divine laws of life and practice of the vital techniques\nof Kriya Yoga awaken latent supersensory powers and perceptions. Such\ndiscipline, with unflinching will and discrimination, estranges material\ndesires and promotes not only control of emotions but control of the\npranic forces. Intuitional wisdom-guided life energy then flows Godward\nin a purifying flood, as the \"lotus petals,\" or rays of the cerebro-\nspinal centers are reversed from matter attention to absorption in the\nbliss of Spirit.\n\nThe results are definite and knowable as you follow the scientific\nsteps you have been given. You will not be deceived by false prophets\nif you unswervingly practice these techniques and remain completely\nloyal to your Guru-Preceptor. The sacred relationship between guru and\ndisciple is unending, for the guru watches over the disciple until his\nliberation is attained and they melt in God. Your footsteps are now\nfirmly set on the path of Self-realization. It is up to you to go for-\nward until you realize the Eternal Bliss.\n\nभै\n\nKRIYA 1 The devotee should never become identified with any process\nleading to salvation, or freedom from reincarnation, but\nshould use the process for its purpose of promoting spiritual growth.\nFor instance, Hatha Yoga is a method of preparing the body for the ad-\nvent of spiritual growth. One should not remain within its confines but\ngo on to the attainment of freedom of mind and soul, as well as of body.\n\nRaja Yoga is the royal road, as it combines the best of other yogic\nmethods with its precepts of meditation. Self-Realization Fellowship\nteaches Raja Yoga techniques of uniting soul and Spirit. The SRF teach-\nings also include the highest good found in other forms of yoga.\n\nPARAMAHANSA YOGANANDA, Founder\nAll Rights Reserved (FOR MEMBER'S USE ONLY)\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 1364, "text": "The foundational principles of all religions consist of Yama, the\nthings a devotee should not do, and Niyama, the things a devotee should\ndo. However, although the mere practice of the \"shalts\" and the \"shalt\nnots\" gives a certain satisfaction, it does not lead to further spiri-\ntual progress unless other steps follow.\n\nThe third important step is Asana or posture. The purpose of cor-\nrect posture is to rise above, or to stop, the motions of the body whose\nrestlessness prevents awareness of the soul. Stillness is the altar of\nSpirit. Where motion ceases, Spirit begins to manifest.\n\nThe fourth step is called Pranayama, or the switching off of the\nlife force from the senses with the object of attaining Pratyahara. In\nPratyahara the mind is disconnected from the five sense telephones.\n\nYoga comprises all the scientific techniques of uniting soul and\nGod; and Pranayama is the greatest technique of uniting soul and God.\n\nHarness your actions to your resolutions. Those who make the right and\ncontinuous effort are the ones who find God. God says: \"I silently and\never deeply respond to the devotional call of the devotee. My silent\n\nvoice, calling him to ever-increasing bliss-joy in meditation, is my an-\nswer to the call of devotion.\"\n\nKRIYA 2 Without the attainment of the fifth step of the ladder of\n\nSelf-realization, further progress is impossible. The in-\nteriorization of mind, the state called Pratyahara, is an essential con-\ndition of freedom of the mind, and yields the power to use this interi-\norized mind. If you follow the meaning and understand the result of\neach separate step, you will see why this is so. Each step should yield\na definite change in the state of consciousness, as:\n\n1-2. Self-control and perfect equilibrium (practice of Yama-Niyama).\n\n3 Mental and physical calmness (Asana).\n\n4. Heart control, life-~force control, mind control (Pranayama).\n\n5 Freedom of mind from sensations, and power of interiorization\n(Pratyahara).\n\n6. The power to use the interiorized mind to concentrate on one\nthought (Dharana).\n\n7. The power to conceive the vastness of God by feeling or intuition\n(Dhyana).\n\nThe ultimate realization is samadhi, or complete union with God.\nThus you may understand that true meditation is possible only after mas-\ntering Pratyahara.\n\nSince the average person has no conception of God, how can he medi-\ntate upon God? Patanjali explains that the symbol of God is Aum, the\nCosmic Vibration or Cosmic Sound. It is an all-permeating sound, oozing\nout of all atomic vibration. It is the unlimited, omnipresent, omni-\nscient Holy Ghost, containing within itself the guiding principle of\nChrist Intelligence.\n\n"}
{"doc": "Paramahansa Yogananda - SRF - Kriya Yoga Lessons (1372p).pdf", "page": 1365, "text": "K-9A 3\n\nThe Kriya Technique given by Lahiri Mahasaya is the greatest form of\nPranayama; through its practice the heart becomes quiet, the energy is\nswitched off from the five senses, and the mind attains the state of\nPratyahara. The ultimate purpose for which these techniques are practiced\nshould never be forgotten; the devotee should not be content to remain on\none step, but climb to the spiritual pinnacle of Self-realization. Nir-\nbikalpa samadhi is the ultimate realization wherein the soul is completely\nconscious and aware of the ocean of Spirit and of its manifesting waves--\nthe body, mind, and soul--at the same time.\n\nKRIYA 3 The transmutation of the body consciousness, which is identi-\nfied with the senses, into superconsciousness and Cosmic Con-\nsciousness is the \"second birth,\" or rebirth into spiritual consciousness.\n\nIn meditation your consciousness and energy have to be consciously\nwithdrawn from the senses and muscles to the spine. The practice of\nKriya magnetizes the spine by circulating life current lengthwise around\nit, thereby withdrawing life current from the senses and involuntary or-\ngans and concentrating it in the spine. The spine and brain are the in-\nsulated altars where divine energy first descends into the body and goes\nout to the senses, keeping the soul busy with material things. MThere-\nfore, the Kriya Technique is the foundation and continuously expanding\nbase of your own Self-realization, leading your consciousness through\nthe spine to Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nPrana means life energy. Prana is of two kinds: the creative Cos-\nmic Energy that is the source of all living things, and the specific\nprana pervading each human body. The life energy vibrating outward be-\ncomes in man individualized, selfish, and body-bound, forgetting its cos-\nmic connection. This cosmic energy is conscious (but not self-conscious)\nand must be consciously directed in order to become reconnected with its\ninfinite Source.\n\nIn the human body, the seat of this life energy, or prana, is in\nthe medulla oblongata. When through proper practice of Kriya Yoga (a\ntechnique of Pranayama, or life-control) you increase your perception\nand feeling; when the all-seeing eye is open, and when the all-absorbing\npower is felt; you will absorb truth not only through the limited power\nof the senses, but through the unlimited power of your soul perception\nand intuition.\n\nKRIYA 4 Your soul is seeking an experience of God that is tangible.\n\nThe Kriya Technique will give you mathematical results ac-\ncording to how much, how deeply, and how exactly you practice. These\nexercises are for control of prana. Every time you practice correctly,\n\nyour entire system undergoes a change; your brain power and mental re-\nceptivity are expanded. By magnetizing the spine, you transmute the\nlife force into radiant, all-accomplishing spiritual force, which in\nturn hastens physical and mental regeneration and rejuvenation. The\nKriya Technique will transfer your attention from the sensations of\nsight, smell, sound, taste, and touch, to the subtler perceptions in the\nSpine and brain. The saints of India discovered that any bodily effect\non the brain is a slow process, but a change effected by the brain on\n"}

A process of sending the life force around the | ।\nspine, which magnetizes the spine and brain, therefore produces an imme-\n\ndiate effect and quickens evolution. As in science, so in religion,\n\nhidden truths are discovered by using concentration, systematic activity,\n\nand experimentation within the laws of nature emanating from God.\n\nIn order to reap the rich harvest of complete truth, you must faith-\nfully make these practical instructions a part of your life now. Pro-\ncrastination and postponement of effort lead to stagnation and retarda-\ntion in the climb up the Seven Steps of Self-realization.\n\nThrough outside influences of rays and vibrations the mind and soul\nare quickened to a certain state in a year's time. The great ones of\nIndia found that it takes twelve years of solar evolution and right liv-\ning to produce a certain change in mentality. By revolving the life\nforce even once around the spine a change is effected in the brain and\nbody which usually is possible only by a year of diseaseless existence,\ncareful eating, and absorption of solar energy. The passing of this\ncurrent once around the spine will therefore give you the equivalent of\na year of solar evolution. Just as the earth's complete revolution\naround the sun produces one year's effect upon a human being, so the\ntime of human evolution can be quickened by revolving the life force\n(the earthly physical energy) around the elliptical path of the spinal\ncolumn and its six centers: upward from the coccyx to the point between\nthe eyebrows and downward from that point to the coccyx. In man's body,\nthe soul is the central sun; and the six centers of the spine (apart\nfrom the seventh center in the head) make twelve points, corresponding\nto the twelve signs of the zodiac.\n\nKRIYA 5 The Kriya Technique is the scientific, mathematical way of\nchanging the material body consciousness into Cosmic Con-\nsciousness. The correct practice of Kriya fourteen times is equivalent\n\nto twelve years of natural progressive evolution.\n\nThere are few rules to follow, but these few should be strictly ob-\nserved without deviation.\n\nAlways precede the practice of Kriya by a special prayer. fMThis\nhelps you to tune in with the great liberated Gurus of Self-Realization\nFellowship, who will help you in your efforts.\n\nEssential preparation:\n1. Moisten throat with olive oil or melted sweet butter.\n\n2. Face east or north in straight armless chair over which a woolen\nblanket has been placed, running down under the feet.\n\n3. Assume correct posture.\n4. Maintain correct posture by vigilance, without becoming tense.\n5. Experiment with the cool and warm currents of air through the\n\nclosed fists, as described in this Lesson, in order to note the @\nsensation that you are later to imagine passing around the\nspine.\n"}

Thus will your will merge with Divine Will and be-\n\ncome wisdom-guided and limitless.\n\nThe contact of God is filled with treasures and power. This tech-\nnique of Kriya helps to change the center of consciousness from the body\nand senses to the spine, the altar of God. You will find that you will\nbe able to do creative work with ease in any line to which you apply\nyourself. Intuition will develop effortlessly.\n\nGive great care to the study of the technique. Every detail must be\nobserved. Practice each part until you are certain that you are doing\nit correctly. Refer frequently to your notes to be sure that you have\nnot omitted any point.\n\nFirst observe the preparatory rules, then begin Kriya proper, visu-\nalizing the spinal column as a hollow tube running from the coccyx to\nthe point between the eyebrows. Inhale as directed, slowly, evenly,\nwith the throat expanded properly to make the sound of \"AW.\" Imagine a\ncool current passing up inside the spine, to the point between the eye-\nbrows. Then make the sound of \"EE\" while exhaling slowly, and pass the\ncurrent in a warm sensation back down through the hollow tube--through\nthe brain, to trickle warmly and thinly on down the spinal column.\n\nWhen you are sure that you have it right, practice the technique\nfourteen times in succession, keeping the current passing rhythmically\nand evenly around the spine. Imagine the cool current going up inside\nthe spine, and the warm current coming down through the spine. Practice\nfourteen times in the morning and fourteen times in the evening. Do not\nincrease the number of times without written permission from Self-\nRealization Fellowship headquarters. Always practice on an empty stom-\nach: before breakfast, either before dinner or at least three hours\nafter dinner, or before retiring.\n\nContinue to sit in meditation after you have finished practicing.\n\nKRIYA 6 The technique of Kriya has three main divisions: Maha Mudra,\nKriya proper, and Jyoti Mudra, to be practiced in the order\ngiven. Maha Mudra, besides electrifying the spine, helps to straighten\nthe spine, loosen the vertebrae, and distribute the life current into\nthe organs. Jyoti Mudra is for the purpose of guidance through the\nspiritual eye, or will center, that you may see the spiritual light by\n\nyour own effort: \"Tf therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body\nshall be full of light\" (Matthew 6:22). You must not only see the five-\nrayed star, but you must go through it, your wisdom must be shepherded\nthrough the star (the tunnel of light--of eternity). Through that star\nwe may behold everything that is to be seen. The two physical eyes re-\nveal only matter. The \"third eye\" reveals God and Spirit.\n\nStudy carefully the technique of Maha Mudra and Jyoti Mudra, making\nsure of each detail, and practice daily as directed.

Evil tendencies and habits are rats\ngnawing at the vital wires of our mechanism, but they cannot live in\nrarefied spiritual consciousness. Meditation and practice of the Kriya\n\nTechnique will automatically eliminate such tendencies.\n\nKRIYA 7 Study with extreme care the summing up in Lessons K-7 and\nK-7A of the essential points to be observed in the practice\nof Kriya proper. This technique is the foundation of the Seven Steps to\nSelf-realization. Let nothing interfere with your practice. \"Where\nthere is a will, there is a way.\" So, someday, you too may break\nthrough the darkness and perceive the sun of Cosmic Consciousness.\n\nHelpful, but not essential, are the preparatory exercises A and B of\nthis Lesson.\n\nKRIYA 8 During practice of the Kriya Technique the entire spine is\n\nconverted into a magnet that draws bodily currents away\nfrom the senses and nerves. The will center (point between the eye-\nbrows) becomes the positive pole, and the coccygeal plexus becomes the\nnegative pole. The current created by continuous inhalation and exhala-\ntion becomes a magnet of energy that draws into the spine more energy\nfrom the nervous system and from the Cosmic Source. Also, the carbon in\nthe body is burned up during Kriya, and there comes a gradual cessation\nof breathing. This is the greatest psychophysical method for actually\nreversing the \"searchlights\" of the life force, consciousness, and the\nsenses from perceptions of matter to perceptions of the indwelling\nSpirit. Hindu yogis state that the spiritual potency of this current\nactually changes the atomic composition of the body cells.\n\nKRIYA 9 By the process of continuous Kriya breathing, the accumula-\ntion of carbon in the blood is \"burned\" and the impurities\nexpelled from the lungs. In addition, this process changes oxygen into\n\nits basic constituents of atomic energy, which in turn is distilled into\nsubtle life energy.\n\nBy continuous regulated breathing, as prescribed in the Kriya Tech-\nnique, the entire carbon content of the body can be burned out. When\nthat is accomplished, there is no longer any dark, impure venous blood\nflowing in the body to be pumped into the lungs for purification. Hence\nKriya practice gives rest to the heart and lungs.\n\nThe purpose in burning carbon is to quiet the heart. The purpose in\nquieting the heart is to control the five sense telephones and divert\nthe energy from them to the spine. The condition of sleep produces un-\nconscious quietness and its attending peace. The Kriya Technique leads\nto an ever-increasing, ever-new joyous state of awareness. @\n\n"}
