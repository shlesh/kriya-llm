How did Jesus perform \nthis miracle? \nA miracle is a super-law in operation—the ef-\nMiracles: how masters \nfectual working of subtle powers from the mani-\nwork with subtle \nfesting principles of God's astral and causal realms \nforces from the astral \nof creation. How these subtle forces support and \nand causal planes of \nimpinge on physical phenomena is unknown to \ncreation \nordinary persons. The incomprehensibility of the \nmiracles recorded in the Bible thus reduces other-\nwise intelligent minds to blind dogmatism or scornful skepticism. But \nwhy should there be cause for doubt when Nature constantly excites \nman with new revelations? Jesus prophesied: \"Greater works than \nthese shall ye do.\"* He knew that the law of cause and effect was \ncreating in this world an evolution of consciousness through which \nfuture generations would possess in incremental measure the means \nto bring about accomplishments theretofore considered miraculous. \nAmazing advancement will be witnessed as this present ascending \nevolutionary cycle continues toward its apex.f Scientific and spiri-\ntual knowledge will work more and more in harmony and ultimately \nin unity when humanity will gain the knowledge of the subtle laws \nthat operate in the inner cosmos of consciousness. The spiritually \nevolved human being, gaining access to the microcosm of the spiri-\ntual eye, dissolves delusion's vibratory boundaries encapsulating the \nphysical universe and brings on earth the superphysical capabilities \nof heaven. \nAlready many of Jesus' phenomenal feats can be deemed credible \nbecause of modern physics, at least in defining principles long known \nto masters who manipulate these cosmic formulas as easily as a scien-\ntist mixes elemental substances to create new compounds in his labo-\nratory.

All that is around us (in-\ncluding our own bodies) which appears so substantial is ultimately \nnothing but ephemeral networks of particle-waves whirling around at \nlightning speed, colliding, rebounding, disintegrating into almost total \nemptiness—so-called matter is mostly emptiness, proportionately as \nvoid as intergalactic space, void of anything except occasional dots \nand spots and scattered electric charges.\"! \nIn The Mysterious \nUniverse,$ Cambridge University physicist Sir \nJames Jeans declares: \"Today there is a wide measure of agreement, \nwhich on the physical side of science approaches almost to unanimity, \nthat the stream of knowledge is heading toward a non-mechanical re-\nality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a \ngreat machine. Mind no longer appears as an accidental intruder into \nthe realm of matter; we are beginning to suspect that we ought rather \nto hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter—not of \ncourse our individual minds, but the mind in which the atoms out of \nwhich our individual minds have grown to exist as thoughts.... \n\"The old dualism of mind and matter...seems likely to disappear, \nnot through matter becoming in any way more shadowy or insub-\nstantial than heretofore, or through mind becoming resolved into a \nfunction of the working of matter, but through substantial matter re-\nsolving itself into a creation and manifestation of mind.\" \n\"To put the conclusion crudely, the stuff of the world is mind-\nstuff,\" Eddington summarizes. *§ Boldly forthright about the limita-\ntions of merely material investigations, he has written: \"In regard to \nthe nature of things, [scientific] knowledge is only an empty shell—a \n* Albert Einstein and Leopold Infeld, The Evolution of Physics: The Growth of Ideas \nfrom Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta (Cambridge University Press, 1938). \nf The Nature of the Physical World (Cambridge University Press, 1928). \nt Cambridge University Press, 1930. \n5 The Nature of the Physical World (Cambridge University Press, 1928). \n813 \n"}

All through the physical world runs that unknown \ncontent, which must surely be the stuff of our consciousness. Here is \na hint of aspects deep within the world of physics, and yet unattain-\nable by the methods of physics.\"* \nWhen man understands scientifically the spiritual nature of cre-\nation and the mastery over its underlying laws possessed by illumined \nsouls, he can accept not only the possibility of miracles, but that there \nare numerous ways by which they can be performed, as noted in the \nvarious modes of healing employed by Jesus. \nAs to feeding the five thousand, one of the methods Jesus would \nhave found effective is mental suggestion or mass hypnosis. A very pow-\nerful mind can impose on the mental processes of a \ncrowd a belief in any suggested phenomena. Those \nwho fall under such influence do not become un-\nconscious in all their other faculties and areas of rea-\nson, but are susceptible only to the particular sug-\ngestion of the hypnotist. If someone with very \npowerful magnetism impresses on a hungry person the positive thought \nthat his stomach is full and his appetite satisfied, the feeling of hunger \nwill vanish. Professor James of Harvard demonstrated that it is possible \nto produce actual blisters on the skin by the power of hypnotic sugges-\ntion. Mind is the main mechanism in the body. Once the mind becomes \nconvinced about a thing, the body reacts accordingly. So Jesus, with his \ntremendous will power, could have used mass hypnosis to satisfy the \nhunger of the five thousand; but I doubt that he even considered it! \nJesus instructed his disciples to see that the people were comfort-\nably seated on the grass-carpeted ground, from which they would re-\nceive some magnetism of the earth. Jesus then took the loaves and \nfishes and gave thanks to God, \"and looking up to heaven, he blessed \nthem\"—he charged the offering of food with condensed cosmic en-\n* Space, Time and Gravitation: An Outline of the General Relativity Theory (Cam-\nbridge University Press, 1920). \nSpeaking about methods of attaining a deeper insight into nature than that af-\nforded by material science, Professor Brian D. Josephson of Cambridge University, win-\nner of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1973, commended the ancient Hindu systems of \nphilosophy: \"Vedanta and Sankhya hold the key to the laws of mind and thought \nprocess, which are correlated to the quantum field, i.e., the operation and distribution \nof particles at atomic and molecular levels.\" (Publisher's Note) \nJesus' use of the pow-\ners of mind and life \nenergy in feeding the \nfive thousand \n814 \n"}

While science has proved the quiddity of the \nuniverse as electromagnetic radiations, coalesced into various forms, \nit has yet to devise instruments subtle enough to register the underly-\ning source of electromagnetic phenomena: finer-than-atomic astral life \nenergy and even finer thoughtrons, vibrations of an infinite con-\nsciousness. Masters such as Jesus know creation as God knows it and \ncan manipulate intelligent cosmic energy to create at will any desired \neffect from its primal cause. \nIn dreams, the mind of every person uses thought and life energy to \nbecome a prolific creator. Dreams are condensed thoughts, made visible \nby the life energy withdrawn from the sensory organs into the brain dur-\ning sleep. In the world created in his dream state, a sleeper can plant \nwheat, raise it, harvest it, grind it, and bake it into bread. He can eat of \nthe dream bread, taste it, feel its fresh texture in his mouth. But all things \nin that dream—the seed, the soil, the oven, the bread, the body that eats \nand enjoys it—are only modifications of the dreamer's consciousness. \nSuppose a person dreams of five thousand people and has only \nfive dream loaves of bread to feed them. If he has the power of con-\nscious dreaming, he can command his mind, \"Since these five loaves \nare only materializations of my thoughts, I shall multiply them by vi-\nsualization until I have adequate to serve all the people.\" To produce \ndreams consciously and at will is one of the first powers attained by \nthe advancing yogi. An accomplished master perceives how God has \ncondensed His creative thoughts to produce all phenomena of this \ndream world, and by the cosmic hypnosis of maya has suggested those \ndreams so powerfully to our human consciousness that we accept the \ncosmic chimera as material reality. \n815 \n"}

By the command of his divinely attuned \nwill, he could cause the cosmic energy to condense into electrons, pro-\ntons, atoms, and molecules of any kind, of any density and specific \ngravity, informed into whatsoever he willed. After his crucifixion, he \nre-created his body; thus it was a simple matter for him to create a few \nmore loaves of bread—the process is the same. He had only to com-\nmand electromagnetic radiations to multiply the food as the five thou-\nsand people were consuming it. Such feats can be done by anyone who \nhas complete mastery of the mind. Mind is everything. \nIf a small eyedropper were connected to a large reservoir of wa-\nter, the eyedropper would continuously drip one drop of water at a \ntime. Thousands of persons could drink of that water even though the \nwater came in tiny drops, but continuously. The five loaves and two \nfishes, broken up into tiny fragments, were charged continuously with \nthe replicating power of the creative lifetronic energy drawn by Jesus \nfrom the infinite reservoir of the astral realm—morsel by morsel, un-\ntil all were fed. \nFrom the story of the loaves and the fishes, we see also the prac-\nticality and precision of Jesus, who always looked to the comfort of \nthe people. Lest anyone be bypassed in the disarray of the throng dur-\ning the distribution of the food, he had his disciples divide the multi-\ntude by fifties, throughout the grassy area. In instructing his disciples \nto gather up all remnants after everyone had eaten, he was not only \nstressing economy in not wasting bounty given by God, but also cit-\ning the reverence with which one should treat blessed food (referred \nto in India as prasad), which on this occasion was a special creation \nof God.* \n- \nIt is evident that according to the custom and \nIs a vegetarian diet \nfood supply of the time, Jesus did not sponsor strict \nnecessary for spiritual \nvegetarianism. The cultivation of fruits, grains, and \nprogress? \nvegetables was relatively sparse in the desert places \nwhere he preached.

Let me quote an extract from the book apropos to this \npresent Discourse: \nFrom science, then, if it must be so, let man learn the philosophic \ntruth that there is no material universe; its warp and woof is maya, \nillusion. Under analysis all its mirages of reality dissolve.... \nIn his famous equation outlining the equivalence of mass and \nenergy, Einstein proved that the energy in any particle of matter is \nequal to its mass or weight multiplied by the square of the velocity \nof light. The release of the atomic energies is brought about through \nannihilation of the material particles. The \"death\" of matter has \ngiven birth to an Atomic Age. \nLight velocity is a mathematical standard or constant not be-\ncause there is an absolute value in 186,300 miles a second, but be-\ncause no material body, whose mass increases with its velocity, can \never attain the velocity of light. Stated another way: only a material \nbody whose mass is infinite could equal the velocity of light. \nThis conception brings us to the law of miracles. \nMasters who are able to materialize and dematerialize their \nbodies and other objects, and to move with the velocity of light, and \nto utilize the creative light rays in bringing into instant visibility any \nphysical manifestation, have fulfilled the lawful condition: their \nmass is infinite. \nThe consciousness of a perfected yogi is effortlessly identified \nnot with a narrow body but with the universal structure. Gravita-\ntion, whether the \"force\" of Newton or the Einsteinian \"manifes-\ntation of inertia,\" is powerless to compel a master to exhibit the \nproperty of weight: the distinguishing gravitational condition of all \nmaterial objects. He who knows himself as the omnipresent Spirit \nis subject no longer to the rigidities of a body in time and space. The \nimprisoning \"rings-pass-not\" have yielded to the solvent: I am He. \nThe cohesive property of maya's creative vibration holds together \nevery iota of matter sporting its presence in the universe.

The body's mass of dancing electrons—light, en-\nergy—when compacted and integrated by mind as a creative sensory \ninstrument of maya, suggests itself as a solid entity. Applying the phys-\nical processes described by Einstein, however, scientists could convert \nthe body into its constituent energy; but they lack the ability to do it \nby mind power, as Jesus did. A master who realizes that the mind con-\ntrols the body, and who possesses complete control over the mind, can \npartially or fully disintegrate the atoms of the body—changing its spe-\ncific gravity or completely dematerializing it—and then restore the \nbodily composition to its customary solidity at will. \nSuperconscious realization that the body is made of informed en-\nergy, a dream image of mind-stuff, instantly frees one from the delu-\nsion of specific gravity; without the density of mass, there is no weight. \nBut as long as the conviction of corporeal solidity persists in one's \nmind, the body will surely sink if one tries to walk on the unsupport-\nive lesser density of a body of water. \nIf a sleeping man dreams he is drowning, his consciousness would \nsuffer a painful sense of suffocation. But if he knew the art of con-\ntrolling his dreams at will, he could save his dream self simply by \nchanging his dream thoughts to behold his dream body floating safely \non the dream waters. Jesus, perceiving his body, the sea, and the con-\nglomerate world as differentiated dream waves of consciousness man-\nifesting as various electromagnetic waves of material forms, could by \nmere willing change the specific gravity or the electronic composition \nof his body so that weightlessly it could walk on water as naturally as \nthe solid body of an ordinary man strides the solid earth. \nA small cork tied to a heavy piece of iron will be submerged if \ndropped in a pot of water; but if the cork were separated from the \niron, it would float.

Here are some instances: \n\"St. Peter of Alcantara was unable to hear the lofty words of St. John, Verbum \ncara factum est ['The Word was made flesh'], pronounced without falling into ecstasy \nand being raised above the earth. The Franciscan, Biagio of Caltanisetta, went into ec-\nstasy simply at the names of Jesus and Mary, and, enraptured with their beauty, sprang \ninto the air. Blessed Giles, of the Order of St. Dominic, remained suspended in the air \nin ecstasy for whole nights without it being possible to bring him back to earth...St. \nThomas of Villanova, whilst preaching one day in his cathedral, suddenly went into \necstasy and remained suspended in the air for twelve hours.\" \nThe levitations of seventeenth-century St. Joseph of Cupertino are among the most \nfamous. The London Times reported on March 24, 2003: \"In a message marking the \n400th anniversary of the birth of St. Joseph, the Pope said that the Franciscan friar, \nwho was said to amaze congregations by levitating and flying through the air, was spir-\nitually close to our times. He is the patron saint of aviators and students....Witnesses \nrecord that after falling into an ecstatic trance, St. Joseph would utter a loud cry and \nsoar into the air, sometimes flying down the nave and sometimes flying out of the \nchurch and across the hills for several miles. He was put on trial by the Inquisition, \nbut when he flew over the heads of his inquisitors, the judges referred the case directly \nto the Pope, Urban VIII.

Among the powers men-\ntioned are levitation and the ability to walk on water or mire without sinking (Yoga \nSutras 111:40), as well as the ability to exercise the eight aishvaryas (ascetical majesties; \nsee Discourse 70) and to perfect the body so that its functions are unaffected by the \nproperties of earth, water, fire, air, ether—the solid, liquid, fiery, gaseous, and ethereal \nphases of matter (Yoga Sutras 111:45-46). \nIn Sutra 111:38, Patanjali warns the sincere seeker of God-union that the use of phe-\nnomenal powers is an obstacle, tempting the yogi to egotistical pride and distracting \nhim from the true Goal. The advancing devotee is careful to shun the use of any su-\npernatural powers he might attain, or to employ them only when he is certain of di-\nvine permission. After becoming irrevocably established in samadhi, of course, the per-\nfected yogi is guided by God's wisdom; he then exercises the siddhis or refrains from \ndoing so entirely according to the inner promptings of the Divine Will. \n824 \n"}

Saintly souls have transcended the symbol-\nogy and experienced in ecstasy the true receiving of Christ commun-\nion. Sincere devotees should learn the technique of interiorizing the \nconsciousness in meditation for actual realization of the Christ Con-\nsciousness in their consciousness.* \n* \"His flesh is the Word [/ogos], and his blood is the Holy Spirit,\" says the third-century \ngnostic Gospel of Philip (The Nag Hammadi Library in English, James M. Robinson, ed.; \nHarperSanFransisco, 1990). Such views were later replaced by the official church dogma \nof transubstantiation—the doctrine that the bread and wine used in the Eucharistic rites \nare mystically transformed into the physical body and blood of Jesus when blessed by an \nordained priest during the liturgy of Holy Mass. The esoteric truth behind the church's \ndogmas and outer rituals, however, was not lost sight of by those of deeper insight, such \nas Saint Basil the Great, revered Doctor of the Church and bishop of Caesarea (329-379). \nKaren Armstrong, in A History of God, describes the distinction between dogma and \nkerygma made by Basil, who taught that \"both kinds of Christian teaching were essential \nto religion. Kerygma was the public teaching of the Church, based on the scriptures. \nDogma, however, represented the deeper meaning of biblical truth, which could only be \napprehended through religious experience and expressed in symbolic form. Besides the \nclear message of the Gospels, a secret or esoteric tradition had been handed down 'in a \nmystery' from the apostles; this had been a 'private and secret teaching, which our holy \nfathers have preserved in a silence that prevents anxiety and curiosity...so as to safeguard \nby this silence the sacred character of the mystery. The uninitiated are not permitted to be-\nhold these things: their meaning is not to be divulged by writing it down.' (Basil, On the \nHoly Spirit, 28.66.) Behind the liturgical symbols and lucid teachings of Jesus, there was a \nsecret dogma which represented more developed understanding of the faith....Some reli-\ngious insights had an inner resonance that could only be apprehended by each individual \nin his own time during what Plato had called theoria, contemplation....As Basil said, these \nelusive religious realities could only be suggested in the symbolic gestures of the liturgy.\" \nSee also Discourse 69, commentary on Jesus' words at the Last Supper.

What and if ye shall see \nthe Son of man ascend up where he was before? It is the Spirit that \nquickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto \nyou, they are spirit, and they are life.

Jesus thereby promised his doubting disciples \na demonstration of spirit and life contained in the truth of his words. \n\"When you concentrate on the Spirit, you understand that the In-\nfinite Immortality can enliven your temporary life with eternal life.

I know those \namong you who believe not that the universal panacea for human suf-\nfering lies hidden behind the words of my wisdom, if they are truly ap-\nplied and fully realized.\" \nWhen Jesus speaks of his words being \"spirit and life,\" he implies \nthe truth that every word has two aspects—the consciousness con-\ntained in it and the energy it produces. When a psychologically sick \nman is repentant and hears the word \"peace\" from a saintly individ-\nual, he becomes saturated with the consciousness of peace and with \nmental encouragement from an infusion of life-giving energy. Toward \nthis end, Jesus made it clear to his disciples that if they were in tune \nwith him they would feel the Christ-wisdom of Spirit behind his words \nand the life-giving energy contained in them. \nThe words of Jesus were not bookish dissertations, but emanated \ndirectly from the wisdom fountain of Cosmic Consciousness and the \nlife-sustaining Christ Consciousness-guided Cosmic Energy.

He told this from his intimate knowledge of the in-\nner life of each of his twelve disciples. \nIf Jesus were sure that all his twelve disciples were prisoners of \ndestiny and that eleven were ordained to remain faithful to him, he \nwould not have asked: \"Will ye also go away?\" Jesus knew that the \ndisciples, though influenced by karma and cosmic law, still had free \nwill to be with him or to forsake him. In fact, Jesus predicted his be-\ntrayal at the hands of Judas in order to warn him, that he might cor-\nrect his karmic predisposition and refrain from doing the evil act. \n*Cf.

In Lost Christianity (New York: Tarcher/Penguin, \n2003), Professor Jacob Needleman says of Evagrius's teaching: \"The key term is the \nword apatheia, which translates into our word 'apathy' but which is as far from the \nmeaning of our English word as diamonds are from broken glass....Apatheia means, lit-\nerally, 'without emotions'—or, more precisely, freedom from emotions....Evagrius him-\nself writes, 'Now this apatheia has a child called agape [love of God] who keeps the \n859 \n"}

If these proclivities are evil, they will surely proceed from the \nfeelings of the heart into actions that defile man's innate nobility. \nThat is why Jesus emphasized the difference between external and \ninternal methods of purifying the heart: \"Out of the evil karmic ten-\ndoor to deep knowledge of the created universe. Finally, to this knowledge succeed the-\nology [experiential knowledge of God] and the supreme beatitude.'\" \nLikewise, in Yoga Sutras 1:21 Patanjali says that the goal of yoga is nearest—that is, \nis reached most quickly by—those who possess tivra-samvega (extreme dispassion; not \na negative state but a transmutation of longing for the world into intense ardor for God). \nProfessor Needleman continues: \"The most influential of Evagrius' practical writ-\nings may be taken as general guidelines for the arduous inner struggle to break free from \nthe sufferings and illusions brought to man by the emotions. Emotions and the thoughts \nthat support them are often given the name 'demons.' This term, which sounds so naive \nto the modern mind, has a meaning that is anything but naive. Man is a microcosmic \nbeing; he lives and moves within a field of forces and influences spanning the entire on-\ntological range of forces in the universe. These forces have a direction—a vertical di-\nrection toward or away from unity with God. And the transactions of these forces take \nplace within the mind and heart, within the 'soul,' as well as in the external universe.... \n\"The Praktikos of Evagrius begins with the listing of eight kinds of 'evil' or 'pas-\nsionate' thoughts: gluttony, impurity, avarice, sadness, anger, acedia ['the desire to give \nup'], vainglory, and pride. By calling them 'thoughts,' Evagrius is referring to an ex-\nceedingly important element in the early-Christian teaching about the emotions....'It \nis not in our power,\" Evagrius writes, 'to determine whether we are disturbed by these \nthoughts, but it is up to us to decide if they are to linger within us or not and whether \nor not they are able to stir up our passions.' \n\"In short, thoughts, impulses, associations appear within the psyche, but as such they \nare not yet emotions. It is only when these 'thoughts' are given something by ourselves, \nsome energy, some specific psychic force, that they take on the nature of emotion—passion \n—and assume their overwhelming power in our inner and outer lives.\" (Publisher's Note) \n860 \n"}

Miracles cannot be demonstrated \nby conditional belief or imagination, but by uniting the Self with God. \nThere is a way to cultivate belief until it becomes faith or absolute \nconviction. Belief is the initial recipient attitude of the mind necessary \nfor planting the seed of a hoped-for outcome. As a successful farmer \nlearns the laws of planting for a good harvest, so a truth-seeking in-\ndividual must learn how to cultivate the soil of belief so that it may \nyield the desired result. When the seed of his aspiration is continuously \nwatered with belief in the Self and in the intercession of a master—as \nwhen the disciples appealed to Jesus—it sprouts into faith that the de-\nsired result will inevitably be accomplished. \nJesus knew the laws of truth; he was equipped with almighty \nGod-consciousness and knew that anyone who trusted in him and his \nwords would create a channel through which he could easily transfer \nto the supplicator the powers within his Christ Consciousness. Ordi-\nnary spiritual teachers cannot surcharge people as Jesus did, because \nthey themselves are not always convinced of the power of divine will \nand intuition-born faith and are thus lesser conduits for its transmis-\nsion to others. \nJesus taught from his own experience and example that soul in-\ntuition and its supremely accomplishing power of faith develop in \nthose who meditate deeply and do not stimulate body consciousness \nby constant dependence only on material sustenance.* When the soul \ncontinuously remains identified with the delusive dream-body, it puts \non the weaknesses of that mass of matter and forgets to exercise the \nall-powerful faith hidden within itself.

Hence every devotee \nshould meditate on his transcendent blissful Self and preserve that ever \nnewly joyous state of consciousness. It is greater to realize the perfec-\ntion of the soul, which is immortal, than just to acquire by mental \npower health of the temporal body, which has to be cast away at the \ncall of death. When the consciousness of the devotee is finally united \nto Cosmic Consciousness, which sustains and controls the medley of \ndream forms in the cosmic dream universe, then through that con-\nsciousness \"all things are possible to him.\" \nJesus stressed to his disciples that the way to rouse the power of \nfaith is to realize the presence of God within one's own Self. To produce \ndifficult supernatural healings or other miraculous phenomena, it is nec-\nessary first to accomplish the supreme miracle: uniting the soul with \nGod to the conscious satisfaction of the Self and the Divine Father. \nIt is in the nature of faith to create anything it wants.

It is read with laughter and weeping and excitement almost to \nthe end, with still many questions left unanswered until in the last \nchapter all the puzzles are solved. This book of life is written by the \nMaster Novelist. The full meaning of His masterpiece will not be un-\nderstood by anyone who has not himself become one with the Mas-\nter, able then to read His thoughts between the divinely scripted lines. \nUntil you know the wisdom and love that interlaces the plot of life, \nhave faith in God. \nLive the life divine: Conquer bad habits and do not cater all the \ntime to the body. Give it to God. The devotee says: \"Lord, You are the \ncreator and owner of this body, so it is for You to help me care for it; \nand I know You will.\" A person with a hundred years of prosperity \nand health, but with no spiritual realization, is not as fortunate as one \nwho is crippled, deaf, blind, and forsaken, but who has God in his \nheart. \nTo meditate and practice Kriya Yoga is the scientific way of solv-\ning the mystery of life and its inscrutable problems, by first solving the \nmystery of the Self and its relationship with Spirit. Gradually one at-\ntains; through the science of the Spirit comes power to do all miracles. \nTo anyone trained in the methods of the masters the knowledge of the \nmasters comes, fulfilling one's hope—the hope of all mankind—to set \nthe spirit free. \n\"If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed....\" Immortal words! \nspoken to shatter the bonds of doubt-enslaved mortals and rouse their \nnative all-conquering will: \"Beware, O ye mountains! Stand not in my \nway. Your ribs will be shattered and tattered today!\"* \n*From Swami Ram Tirtha's poem \"Marching Light,\" set to music under the name \n\"Swami Ram Tirtha's Song\" by Paramahansa Yogananda in his Cosmic Chants (pub-\nlished by Self-Realization Fellowship). \n905 \n"}

In ac-\ncord with the tenets of these monastic renunciant \norders that have existed continuously in India since \nIndia's ideal ofcom-\nancient times, Jesus considered no dwelling place as \nplete renunciation ex-\nhis home and amassed no money for food or cloth- \nemplified in the life \ning; he did not marry or acknowledge his earthly \nof Jesus \nrelatives as his sole family. He required of his apos-\ntles, also, the strict life of renunciation: \"And commanded them that \nthey should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, \nno bread, no money in their purse: but be shod with sandals; and not \nput on two coats\" (Mark 6:8-9; s e e Discourse 40). \"Whosoever he be \nof you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple\" \n(Luke 14:33; see Discourse 58). \"Sell that ye have, and give alms; pro-\nvide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that \nfaileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. For \nwhere your treasure is, there will your heart be also\" (Luke 12:33-34; \nsee Discourse 56). The corollary of outer renunciation is the nonat-\ntachment of inner renunciation: \"Take no thought for your life, what \nye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall \nput on\" (Matthew 6:25; see Discourse 29). That is, consider your body \na part of God and do not emphasize the material consciousness in it; \nspiritualize it by tuning your consciousness with God-consciousness, \nand you will realize that your life is sustained directly by your Creator. \nA God-surrendered, God-supported life has been extolled by some \nof India's greatest prophets, including Lord Buddha, Swami Shankara, \nand Sri Chaitanya. Initiates of the Swami Order, reorganized by \nSwami Shankara, and of the Buddhistic monastic order (predating the \nChristian era), follow the above-mentioned tenets of renunciation.* \n*In The Vision of God (New York: Longmans, Green and Co., 1932), Dr. Kenneth E. \nKirk, Anglican bishop of Oxford, points out that Jesus' ideals of renunciation were not \nderived from traditional Jewish teachings: \"The ascetic outlook of the Gospels is seen to \nstand out of any recognizable relation with contemporary Judaism. The passages about \nturning the other cheek, about taking no thought for the morrow, about laying up no \ntreasure on earth, about forsaking parents and possessions, about bearing the Cross are \nforeign to the genius of the [Jewish] race.\" Though Bishop Kirk concludes that the his-\ntorical origins of these teachings are something of a mystery, other historians relate them \nto evidence of Jesus' link with India.

He is, therefore, in many \nways, more understood in the Orient than in the Occident, where the \nChristian scriptures are generally interpreted with ample accommo-\ndation for a lifestyle that is spiritually less demanding. Jesus lived the \nlife of a renunciant and celibate, but the West little cares to follow \nthat. They take from his teachings as much as they can adapt without \ninconveniencing their mode of living. Some Catholic monastics and a \nfew others in the West do live the single-hearted renunciant life en-\njoined by Christ (becoming sainted examples); but in the East this \nideal has been emphasized both in the material and the spiritual life. \nIn the West and in the East there are those who have exemplified \nthe requisite inner spirit of renunciation in secular life as well as in the \nhermitages. Bhagavan Krishna, a godly king to whom are ascribed the \nsublime yoga teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, emphasized how to live \nin the world without being attached.* King Janaka, a ruler in ancient \nIndia who was an illumined saint of perfect inner renunciation, also \ndemonstrated this ideal. In the modern era, the life of Lahiri Mahasaya \noffered the same example. \nSwami Shankara extolled wisdom and renunciation; Jesus em-\nphasized devotion and renunciation. Jesus, like Shankara, was a san-\nnyasi, follower of the path of complete outer and inner renunciation. \nThe Sanskrit word sannyas, from roots meaning \"to cast aside,\" de-\nnotes one who divests himself of all encumbrances of identification \nwith a limited body, mind, and ego, acknowledging no other self but \nSpirit. Jesus, who had expanded his love beyond the exclusivity of \nfamily ties and attachments, said: \"Who is my mother? and who are \nmy brethren?\" Shankara similarly expressed his transcendent freedom: \n\" N o birth, no death, no caste have I. Father, mother, have I none.\" \nThe great swami went on to say: \"Mind, nor intellect, nor ego, chitta; \nsky, nor earth, nor metals am I.

Descending into creation—-into \nevery particle of thought, life energy, and matter constituting the causal, \nastral, and physical realms—Cosmic Consciousness is called Christ \nConsciousness (Kutastha Chaitanya).

But by meditation when consciousness and life \nforce are withdrawn from the five senses, the astral nature of the life \nforce, along with the consciousness and many other aroused divine \nforces in the spinal centers, look like rivers of light flowing upward to-\nward the ocean of light of Spirit in the brain. \nEarlier Jesus had said: \"But whosoever drinketh of the water that \nI shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him \nshall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\" And: \n\"I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and \nHe that believeth on me shall never thirst.\"* In the present verses, Jesus \nmakes clear that the way man can find that satisfaction of his soul \nthirst and hunger is to control the outgoing river of life and con-\nsciousness to free himself from bondage to mortal ignorance and sen-\nsory desires. \n* John 4:14 (Discourse 17) and John 6:35 (Discourse 43). \n973 \n"}

In any case, since the man was born blind, there was no \nopportunity for any sin in his present existence to be the cause of his \nmalady.\"\" Nevertheless, being good in his present life, and drawing from \npast-life virtues, he had accrued sufficient good karma \"that the works \nof God should be made manifest in him\"—that is, to merit a miracle \nof divine healing by his coming in contact with God's emissary, Jesus. \nEvil conditions that befall man may be caused not only by the in-\ndividual karma of sin, but by mass or universal karma: man-made or \nnatural calamities arising from conditions influenced or triggered by \nuniversal forces or the cumulative vibrations and actions of the masses \nin general. For example, suppose all of the passengers die in the crash \nof an airliner caught in a thunderstorm; that would not necessarily im-\nply that all those persons were karmically predisposed to perish in that \ndisaster. It was an act of nature affecting that area at that time, and the \nfact that the passengers happened to have chosen that flight. Though \nno specific past sin was necessarily directly related to their death in that \nway, the positive side is that at least some adverse personal karma of \neach individual was consummated by the tragedy. But consider alter-\nnatively that there was a miracle survival of one of the passengers, and \nof some interference that prevented another person from boarding that \nflight; some intervening personal good karma specifically saved those \nindividuals. It could be concluded that these persons were spared \"that \nthe works of God should be made manifest\"—that God expresses His \ncompassion and protection in the workings of the karmic law by which \nthe effects of one's personal good actions can neutralize or mitigate in \noneself the consequences of some otherwise devastating mass disaster. \n* In his scholarly study Reincarnation for the Christian (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, \n1974) Dr. Quincy Howe, Jr., former Professor of Comparative Religion at Scripps Col-\nlege, writes about this incident of the man blind from birth: \n\"There is a glaring inconsistency in the question posed by the disciples. They ask \nthe Lord if the man himself could have committed the sin that led to his blindness. \nGiven the fact that the man has been blind from birth, we are confronted with a \nprovocative question. When could he have made such transgressions as to make him \nblind at birth? The only conceivable answer is in some prenatal state. The question as \nposed by the disciples explicitly presupposes prenatal existence. It will also be noted \nthat Christ says nothing to dispel or correct the presupposition. Here is incontrovert-\nible support for a doctrine of human preexistence [in the Bible]....It is perfectly rea-\nsonable to surmise on the basis of this episode that Jesus and his followers accepted \npreexistence and thought so little of it that the question of prenatal sin did not even \ncall for an answer....We have here an explicit statement of prenatal existence with all \nits implications for karma and reincarnation.\" (Publisher's Note) \n1006 \n"}

The first—an allusion to the short span that \nhis individual incarnation of divinity would remain on the earth plane \n—may be fully grasped only by understanding the broader metaphys-\nical significance of his words, as follows: \nIn the universal sense, \"day\" means the period during which Spirit \nmanifests creation, and \"night\" signifies the period of cosmic dissolu-\ntion, during which naught exists but Unmanifested Absolute Spirit— \nalone, undifferentiated, adorned with no tremor of creative vibratory \nactivity (\"work\").f As long as vibratory creation exists, throughout \nthe long cyclic span of universal manifestation, God exists as the Fa-\nther (the transcendent Creator), the Son (Christ Consciousness, the re-\nflected Intelligence of the Father omnipresent within creation), and \n*See commentary on John 8:12, \"I am the light of the world,\" Discourse 51. \nfThe Bhagavad Gita states: \"The Aum that causes the birth and sustenance and dis-\nsolution of beings and their various natures is termed Karma (cosmic action)....They \nare true knowers of 'day' and 'night' who understand the Day of Brahma, which en-\ndures for a thousand cycles (yugas), and the Night of Brahma, which also endures for \na thousand cycles.

Because of Me (through Prakriti) the worlds revolve \nin alternating cycles (of creation and dissolution)\" (ix:8, 10). \nThese cycles or yugas are discussed in more detail in the commentary on these Gita \nverses in God Talks With Arjuna. \n1007 \n"}

But \nwhen the night or cosmic dissolution of all creation arrives, the re-\nflected Christ Consciousness, devoid of the vibratory receptacle in \nwhich it is reflected, will be withdrawn in the transcendental God the \nFather, even as a mooned reflection becomes united with the skyey \nmoon at the removal of a mirror.

(2) Death is a bigger dissolution in which the soul first \nfinds out that the body is only a shadow, a picture played on the screen of the cosmic \ncinema house. Both of those above processes are unconsciously imposed upon man. \nTherefore yogis learn to produce partial dissolution and the bigger dissolution con-\nsciously by pranayama, switching off the life force from the sensory and motor nerves \n(as in sleep), and further switching off the life force from the sensory and motor nerves, \nmuscles, lungs, heart, spinal cord, seven plexuses, etc. In order to destroy the false re-\nality of the body and its surroundings, and to behold this body and world as pictures, \nand to understand the invisibility and real nature of the soul, the yogi must be able to \nproduce the partial dissolution—Sanskrit khanda (partial) pralaya (dissolution) and \nmahapralaya (bigger dissolution) at will.... \n\"Please practice these two states—of sensory-motor samadhi with heartbeat and \nsensory-motor relaxation samadhi without heartbeat—and you will know this uni-\nverse as God's cosmic cinema house.\" \nt \"Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto Him that sent me.

In India, \nwhere spiritual understanding had developed for thousands of years \nbefore the time of Jesus, God-knowing sages elaborated these concepts \nas a comprehensive spiritual philosophy to guide devotees systemati-\ncally on the path to liberation. When a person makes the effort in \nmeditation to know God, using the sincerity of his heart and deepest \nfeelings, and the intuition of his soul, and all the powers of concen-\ntration of his mind, and all his interiorized life energy, or strength, he \nwill surely succeed. \nThat system of spiritual culture whereby one learns to \"love God \nwith all your heart\" is known in India as Bhakti Yoga—union \nwith \nGod through unconditional love and devotion. The bhakta realizes \nthat whatever is in a person's heart, that is where his concentration is \n—on the thing he loves. As the lover's heart is on the beloved and the \ndrunkard's is on his drink, so the devotee's heart is continuously ab-\nsorbed in love for his Divine Beloved. \nTo \"love God with all your mind\" means with focused concen-\ntration. India has specialized in the science of concentrating the mind \none-pointedly through definite techniques, so that during the time of \nworship the devotee is able to keep his whole attention on God. If \nwhile offering prayerful devotions the mind is constantly flitting to \nthoughts of work or food or bodily sensations or other diversions, that \nis not loving God with all the mind. The Bible teaches: \"Pray without \nceasing\";*' India's yoga science gives the actual methodology to wor-\nship God with that fully concentrated mind. \nTo \"love God with all your soul\" means to enter the state of su-\nperconscious ecstasy, direct perception of the soul and its oneness with \nGod. When no thoughts cross the mind, but there is a conscious all-\nknowingness, when one knows through intuitive realization that he \ncan do anything just by so ordering it, then one is in the expanded \nstate of superconsciousness. It is the realization of the soul as the re-\nflection of God, the soul's connection with the consciousness of God. \nIt is a state of exceeding joy: the soul's crystalline perception of the \nomnipresent Spirit reflected as the joy of meditation. \n*I Thessalonians 5:17. \n1031 \n"}

When the devotee can love God with an inwardly con-\ncentrated mind, he begins to feel that love for God in his heart, exqui-\nsitely permeating every nuance of his feelings with the presence of God. \nThe God-saturated heart then feels the Beloved Lord in the deepest re-\ncesses of the soul where the little love meets and is enfolded by the Great \nLove.

Human life is short \nand one can do only so much. Even Jesus explained \nThe Good Samaritan: \nthat he came mostly to minister to the needs of a \nunderstanding one's \ncertain segment of people during his limited span \nduty to serve and give \non earth.* \naid to others \nThough Jesus and the masters schedule their \ntime in a manner most helpful to true devotees, still their liberating \nteachings can be universally followed through all times. Thus, Jesus \nintimated that though the ordinary man cannot physically or by ma-\nterial means ameliorate widespread afflictions, he should do whatever \nhe can within his power and means to help any person whose need has \nbeen definitely placed in his path, as symbolized in the parable of the \nGood Samaritan. \nTo relieve someone's distress is to render help as one would like \nto be helped if he were in the same position. Whether the needy per-\nson be someone in one's own vicinity or in a distant foreign land, \nanywhere, anyone who comes in close relationship with a person \nphysically, mentally, or spiritually, that person is a neighbor. \nMan's duty to help his fellow beings does not necessarily consist \nof material aid. To give physical help to a neighbor is good, to give \nhim mental and moral help so that he can help himself is better, and \nto give him God-consciousness and freedom from ignorance through \nspiritual upliftment is best. One should serve his neighbor appropri-\nately in accordance with these criteria. \n'Matthew 15:24 (see Discourse 44). \n1039 \n"}

Whatever be man's social titles of race, religion, na-\ntionality, they are his defining characteristics for only a little while; but \nall souls are gods forever. At death, man is rudely divested of his mor-\ntal adornments; so before he leaves this earth, he should declare his \npure nobility as a child of God. Jesus was not proud because he was \nborn of the kingly house of David, but because he was a son of God. \nIf there were no boundaries fancy-frozen by man, all peoples of the \nearth would have sufficiency in the nurturing bounty of nature. A re-\nbirth of loving God and loving one's neighbor as urged by Jesus Christ \nwould bring a spirit of oneness to heal the ills of the world. \nOnly by fellowship with God will harmony and fellowship come \non earth. When one actually perceives the Divine Presence in his own \nsoul, he is inspirited with love for his neighbor—Jew and Christian, \nMuslim and Hindu—in the consciousness that one's true Self and the \nSelves of all others are equally soul-reflections of the one infinitely lov-\nable God. Utopian social and political agendas will have little long-\nlasting benefit until humanity learns the eternal science by which fol-\nlowers of any religion may know God in the oneness of soul and Spirit \ncommunion. \nTo observe the \"first commandment,\" as cited by Jesus, is the cen-\ntric obligation of human life, subordinating and making servile to it \nthe host of demanding responsibilities man gathers unto himself. Jesus \nsupported the scriptural command to \"Honor thy father and mother\" \nbut love God supremely. Father, mother, friends, beloved ones, are \ngifts of God. Love the One Love that hides Himself behind all kindly \nmasks. Love Him first and foremost, or times without numbering He \nwill visit the heart and slip away unrecognized and unwelcomed. \nTo be with God now is of utmost importance. His love is the only \nshelter in life and death. Time should be utilized to its best advantage; \nwhy shouldn't it be to reclaim oneness with the Creator of this Uni-\nverse, our Infinite Father? \n* The Levites were members of the priestly tribe descended from Moses' brother Aaron, \nor those assigned ceremonial temple functions by the priests. \n1040 \n"}

And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at \nJesus' feet, and heard his word. But Martha was cumbered about \nmuch serving, and came to him, and said, \"Lord, dost thou not \ncare that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore \nthat she help me.\" \nAnd Jesus answered and said unto her, \"Martha, \nMartha, \nthou art careful and troubled about many things: But one thing \nis needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not \nbe taken away from her\" (Luke \n10:38-42). \nartha, you are conscientious about material things and duties, \nwhich cause you worry and scatter your mind.

Other \nrenunciants think they can attain God-consciousness by neglecting ser-\nviceful activities to engage only in the spiritual duty of meditation. \nThe primary purpose of an ashram environment is to offer a haven \nin which to seek God.

(For the most part such attempts are no more than false piety.) \nServiceful duties in a hermitage have to be performed by members of \nthe community, and when devotees engage in those dutiful actions with \nthe thought of serving God, and give Him also their undivided atten-\ntion in regular deep meditation, they are on the right path to receive \nthe grace of God. But those who lose themselves in busy-ness, forget-\nful of God and negligent in meditation, receive no spiritual satisfaction \nand begin to doubt the purpose of a renunciant's life as compared to \nthe offerings of the world. \nIt is better to live a life of service to the world in a spiritual envi-\nronment conducive to high ideals and thoughts of God than in a mate-\nrial environment fraught with evils. Nevertheless, any environment can \nbe spiritualized with the presence of God. Thus Jesus warned Martha, \nand by extension all disciples engaged in secular responsibilities, that \nthough she was commendably and necessarily tending to material du-\nties, she was missing the blessing of her service because her mind was so \ndistracted by external demands it accommodated no thought of God. \nJesus upheld the action of Mary because it was from no deliberate wish \nto shun household work, but from sincere devotion that engrossed her \nmind wholly in God and the God-uniting wisdom of Jesus. \nIf Martha's works had been infused with Mary's devotion, Jesus \nwould have made no distinction between the two sisters.

Had Martha similarly ab-\nsorbed his spirit, Jesus would have allowed Mary to assist Martha; but \nhe did not want Mary to imitate her sister's material ways, rather that \nMartha should follow the devotional example of Mary. \nThat is what yoga teaches: In spite of one's duties to the world, \nthe mind should be with God. Duty or no duty, if one tries his utmost \nto know God as his prime responsibility, that is the highest virtue; for \nno duty can be performed without borrowing the powers of God. \nEvery truth-seeker, whether living the secular life of a householder \nor that of a renunciant in a hermitage, should be able to express al-\n1042 \n"}

In simple words, each phrase offered by Jesus in this profound \nprayer resonates a perfect harmony with the cosmic idealism of the an-\ncient sacred scriptures of India, the essence of which is grandly epito-\nmized in the Bhagavad Gita. \nThe prayer can be analyzed as consisting of four distinct parts, the \nwhole of which addresses both the transcendence and immanence of \nGod, and man's relationship with Him as the Heavenly Father of all. \nThe first three parts convey, respectively, the cosmic truths that vali-\ndate the defined systems of Jnana, Karma, and Bhakti \nYoga—union \nwith the Infinite through wisdom, right action, and divine love. The \nfourth, concluding segment is a summary obeisance to the Infinite \nSpirit as the omnificent God the Father. \n1. \"Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy \nkingdom come.\" \n2. \"Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day \nour daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our \ndebtors.\" \n3. \"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\" \n4. \"For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory for \never.\" \nThe first part will be easily understood if one applies the basis of \nthe philosophy of Jnana Yoga: the realization of Spirit as the only Re-\nality. Jesus' concept of God was one of pure idealism—as is that of \nthe highest Sankhya-Yoga-Vedanta metaphysics of India. To follow \nfully the path of God-knowledge that Jesus followed, the path he evi-\ndenced to all the world, that the whole of common life revolves \naround a common center and that that center is God, is to find su-\npreme inspiration from his idealism.* \n* Vedanta, the end or final message of the Hindu Vedas which appears in the Upani-\nshads, propounds the philosophy of monistic idealism.

That personalized God \nJnana Yoga realization\ncould not appeal to his universal spirit; such an idea \nof Spirit as the only \nwas not explicated in his words or his sermons, or Reality \nby implication harbored in his thoughts. His real-\nization embraced the knowing of the Absolute Reality of God as \nSpirit.* Jesus' lofty philosophy was, to a certain extent, the cause of \nhis being marked as a spiritual revolutionary against many of the or-\nthodox concepts of his own Hebrew people. To him God could not be \nlimited by any parameters of creation—time, space, causality, form, \npersonality—nor codified by man-made credos.

That Maker of all becomings spins \nforth the multifarious causal, astral, and physical creations from His \nOne Being and is yet ever untouched by them. In this opening invoca-\ntion to God, Jesus at once lifts our consciousness to the knowledge— \nthe vision, understanding, realization—of the transcendental God.

The Sanskrit term nama-rupa (nama, akin \nbeauty, and joy per- \nto English name) translates as \"name and form.\" \nvading God's creation \"Hallowed be Thy name\" means hallowed is Thy \ncreation, holy is Thy manifestation, spiritual is Thy \nSelf-revelation through the outwardly working Holy Ghost, the Word \nor cosmic vibration of Aum (Amen).

There are no detours or half-measures, no attempt to deflect ultimate respon-\nsibility by blaming a devil or an original sin. \n\"'He [God] does not care; so I say he murders both the pure and the wicked. \n\"'When the plague brings sudden death, he laughs at the anguish of the innocent. \n\"'He hands the earth to the wicked and blindfolds the judges' eyes. \n\"'Who does it, if not he?'... \n\"All this bewilderment and outrage couldn't be so intense if Job didn't truly love \nGod. He senses that in spite of appearances there is somewhere an ultimate justice, but \nhe doesn't know where....Of course, the answer Job receives is anything but what he \nexpected....He is taken up in a state of vision, and enters a world of primal energy, in-\ndependent of human beings, which includes what humans might experience as terrify-\ning or evil.... \n\"These huge symbols of evil, so terrifying to humans who haven't seen, or won't \nacknowledge, the destructive Shiva-aspect of God, are presented to us as God's play-\nthings. They are a part of the continuum of nature, which runs seamlessly from angel \nto beast. 'The roaring of lions,' as Blake wrote, 'the howling of wolves, the raging of \nthe stormy sea, and the destructive sword, are portions of eternity too great for the eye \nof man.'...The only other source in the Bible that approaches [Job's vision] in kilowatts \nis a passage from the anonymous prophet known as Second Isaiah: 'I form light and \ncreate darkness; I make peace and create evil; I the Unnamable do all these things.'\" \nIn essence, God's reply to Job is that he must rise from human consciousness to di-\nvine consciousness in order to understand the seeming paradoxes of creation: \"Where \nwast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understand-\ning.

Thus it is said of those who in ecstasy have en-\ntered the secret vaults of the heart of God and have perforce returned \nwith no words to tell: \"He who knows, he knows; naught else knows.\" \nThen Jesus says: \"Thy kingdom come.\" Here he affirms the tran-\nscendence of the Ultimate Reality made manifest as the Immanent \nEssence of the universal divine imagings of the Creator-Father. \n\"Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy king-\ndom come.\" So sublime, so spiritual, so philosophic is this prayer! Tran-\nscendental God, immanent God, and creation as God's divine manifes-\ntation— all are expressed in the first section of the prayer, a grand \nstatement of the Jnana Yoga truth realization of ultimate wisdom. \nThe key to the second part of the prayer is the word \"will.\" \"Thy \nwill be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. \nears; but now my eyes have seen you,' he is no longer a servant, who fears God and \navoids evil. He has faced evil, has looked straight into its face and through it, into a \nvast wonder and love.\" (Publisher's Note) \n* Revelation 4:11. \n1053 \n"}

Actions are always \npreceded and sustained by will. Material science de-\nclares that all things in the universe are different \nmanifestations of energy; the yogi, a spiritual scien-\ntist, discerns also the subtler underlying energy of prana, life force. But \nwhat is energy; what is prana} Energy is the gross manifestation of will, \nand will is the power or manifesting faculty of consciousness. \nThough all creation came from God's divine vibration, the rebel \nSatanic Delusion has usurped the material expression of God's \"king-\ndom,\" abetted by the sinful actions of the masses over whom has been \ncast the pall of ignorance that shuts out the light of God's presence. \nThus the words \"Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven\": Make \nmanifest in the material vibrations of earth the pristine perfection of \nthe Holy Creative Vibration that went forth from Thy taintless tran-\nscendence by the divine fiat of Thy Will. \n\"Give us this day our daily bread\": \"Bread\" means cosmic energy, \nthe all-sustaining cosmic vibration of Aum.f \nAgain, a reference to \nkarma, cosmic action by which God sustains all life. \n* \"The Aum (Visarga, the two dots \nrepresenting the duality of Cosmic Vibration) that \ncauses the birth and sustenance and dissolution of beings and their various natures is \ntermed Karma (cosmic action)\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita vm:3). \nFrom Paramahansa Yogananda's commentary: \"The cosmic vibration (Aum) with \nits law of duality and relativity emanates from Spirit and causes the birth, sustenance, \nand dissolution of all matter and beings through the law of karma. This law of action \nholds sway over all activities of man and Nature.... \n\"Karma signifies all cosmic divine and material activities as well as the spiritual and \nworldly activities of human beings....The Aum or cosmic intelligent vibration is the first \nmanifestation of God in creation. Therefore all the cosmic activities emanating from the \nintelligent cosmic Vibratory Being—the Aum—are termed Supreme Cosmic Karma. Man \nis a miniature or microcosmic manifestation of the macrocosmic Vibratory Being (the in-\nvisible intelligent Holy Ghost, or Aum, or the Word). Man's spiritual, worldly, and evil ac-\ntivities are termed human karma. God, manifested as the cosmic Vibratory Being or Aum, \nis the direct Originator of all cosmic and human activities, governed by the law of karma, \nor cause and effect. The whole cosmos and all its sentient beings are subject to this law.\" \nf \"Man shall not live by bread [material sustenance] alone, but by every word [unit of \ncosmic energy vibrating out of the Holy Ghost or omnipresent Aum] that proceedeth \nout of the mouth of God [descends into the human body through the subtle astral cen-\nter of life in the medulla oblongata]\" (Matthew 4:4; see commentary in Discourse 8). \n\"Thy will be done\": \nthe Karma Yoga way \nof manifesting God in \naction \n1054 \n"}

For intellectuals it is a long-\nstanding perplexing question how God could lead man into evil tempta-\ntion, and why.f But followers of the devotional way to God (Bhakti \nYoga) focus on a simple truth: The easiest way to overcome finiteness is \nto give oneself completely to God, with the totality of one's faults and \none's virtues. How quickly whatever is negative within one's character is \nresolved by love of God! Love, in a most wonderful way, transforms and \nspiritualizes wherever it appears. By patiently cultivating devotion, the \nbhakta eventually finds that no matter what temptation of desire arises \nin his life, it is at once transcended when he sincerely gives that desire to \nthe Divine. By the responding touch of God's perfection, all the nega-\ntiveness trying to infiltrate the devotee's heart can be instantly overcome. \nThrough everything beautiful and desirable in this world, it is the \nCosmic Lover who is calling to man. The lure of worldly offerings is \na test of choices, whether God's children want Him or material grati-\nfications. So long as one chooses God's playthings and not Him, so \nlong will that soul have to reincarnate, unfulfilled, in mortal entan-\nglements. But the devotee who turns his face Homeward, recognizing \nbehind all lesser desires the desire of the soul for the love of God, is \n'Matthew 6:14-15; see Discourse 28.

This yoga of absolute resignation \n—unqualified devotion and divine love, bhakti—is invoked in this sup-\nplication: \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\" \nThus Jnana, Karma, and Bhakti, corresponding to the processes \nof (i) thought, (2) volition, and (3) feeling, are the basis of the first \nthree parts of the Lord's Prayer, making this prayer inclusive of the \nhighest philosophy of human life. After all, what is the purpose of life? \nTo attain oneness with God, by purifying human reasoning or intel-\nlect with the wisdom consciousness of God; attuning human will to be \nan instrument of God's will; oblating human love in God's universal \nlove.

To understand any scripture, \nit is necessary to understand the definite meaning of the words, not \nonly from their etymology, but also from the philosophical truth they \nare intended to convey. \nMaster means one who is the master, not of others, but of him-\nself. He has complete wisdom-control of his senses. He is not a mas-\nter who dominates the actions of others by the power of his com-\nmanding voice and will, but he who is the owner and wise ruler of his \nown actions. God is the ultimate owner, and therefore the Supreme \nMaster, of the universe. Those who are one with Him are themselves \nmasters, and can rightly be honored with that title by others. Being es-\ntablished in divine consciousness—in fact, not imagination—they can \nproclaim their godly state as Christ affirmed his, and not in any way \nbe egotistically affected by it. Having completely subdued the ego, a \nmaster neither covets nor flaunts an exalted title as his own. His whole \nbeing rather than his words declares his divine consciousness. He who \nsays he is not a master is probably not a master; and he also is not a \nmaster who finds it necessary to declare to others that he is a master. \nEssentially, as Jesus pointed out, \"Ye are gods\";* but it is spiritu-\nally presumptuous to present oneself as such until he has actually re-\nalized his divinity and behaves accordingly. One who has not mastered \nhis moods, emotions, and sensory temptations; and who is bothered \nby life's many irritants, losing inner peace because others can \"get his \ngoat\" by a few words of annoyance, is far from expressing himself as \na god or a master. \nA master may be a jivanmukta, literally, \"freed while living.\" He \nhas conquered all desires for mortal life, thus destroying the root cause \nof reincarnation. Even so, there may be subtle traces of karma of past \nlives not yet fully consumed in the fire of wisdom. The jivanmukta em-\nploys his spirituality to free himself, through various measures (as in \nsamadhi meditation), from karma and hidden desires of past lives as \nwell as the present. Jivanmuktas \nare kings among mortals. In their di-\nvine aloofness they can never be hurt no matter what is denied to them. \nOnce a jivanmukta is completely free from past and present karmic \nbondage, he is said to be a siddha, \"a perfected being.\" Perfected be-\nings on earth may be Christlike souls (their consciousness united with \nthe universal Christ Consciousness); they may manifest the parama-\n*John 10:34 (see Discourse 52). \n1069 \n"}

That is \nwhy Jesus speaks to the nations of the earth: \"O you nations, do not \nbe selfish and think only of food, industry, and raiment, in utter for-\ngetfulness of brotherhood and God, the Giver of all things, or you will \nbring self-created disaster on yourselves through your ignorance and \nits attendant wars, pestilence, and other miseries.\" \nProsperity often dulls the social conscience: \"What do we care for \nother nations: We worked to create our prosperity so that we could \nroll in plenty!

Satan works constantly to \ndivert the devotee from the do's and don'ts of the Godward path, in-\nsinuating the thought that one is thereby exercising his independence. \nBut persons in thrall to the ego with its karmic accumulation of habits \nand desires are anything but independent, and are rarely able to adopt \nthe right course for themselves. Nevertheless, an even more potent in-\nfluence than one's karma is the help and blessing of a God-knowing \nguru. Through reverent observance of the guidance of a master, one can \nfree himself from all embedded compulsions of past karma. \nTo be faithful to the principles of the divinely ordained guru-\ndisciple relationship is the sure way to reach God. Whereas the un-\nguided devotee wanders into spiritual difficulties and disillusionment, \nthe disciple who gives loyalty and obedience to one who has found God \nmakes the spiritual path simple and straightforward. His devotion and \nfaith establish constant inner attunement, so that regardless of any as-\nsaults of Satan, he can rely on the hidden and open aid of his Christ-\nlike master to keep him safe and steady in his progress toward freedom. \nThat is the basis of Jesus' response to the question, \"Lord, are there \nfew that be saved?\" The reply signified: \"All who strive to enter into the \nkingdom of Cosmic Consciousness by availing themselves of the help of \na guru and his liberating spiritual techniques will find the strait gate and \nnarrow way of Self-realization into the Infinite.

The \"strait gate\" and \"narrow way\" are among \nthe many uses by Jesus of the double entendre in his teachings: the \"strait gate\" of vir-\ntuous inclinations, and the \"narrow way\" of the spiritual disciplines of righteous ac-\ntions; so also, metaphysically, these phrases refer to the gateway in the subtle astral \ncenter at the base of the spine, which opens into the astral spine's narrow, extremely \nfine pathway through which the life and consciousness ascend to the higher cere-\nbrospinal centers of spiritual perception—the singular path of ascension to Christ con-\nsciousness and union with God in cosmic consciousness. In these present verses, both \nmeanings are again intended in the context of the guidance and blessing of the guru \nwho not only leads the disciple through the strait gate of the path of virtue, but also \nultimately opens the inner astral door of ascension to God. \n1110 \n"}

Undeveloped worldly persons, because of their bodily attach-\nments and desires, amass much karma of delusion. Even divine incar-\nnations, though their souls have been fully liberated, must subject \nthemselves to at least some measure of cosmic delusion simply to \nmaintain a finite form separate from Spirit. \nThe \"karma\" thus accrued by liberated masters is the natural \nworking of the cause-effect principle governing all actions in the realm \nof manifestation; it may also consist of unfinished works of their pre-\nvious incarnations, such as helping to liberate their advanced disciples, \nor to state anew and revive truth, or even to toy with some passing \nfancy, renounced and forgotten, but which God in loving, whimsical \nwisdom deigns to fulfill.* Masters can work out or otherwise negate \ntheir karma by prayer and acts of divine will in meditation or in the \nafterlife spiritual realms, both of which forms of release were em-\nployed by Jesus. \nThus the \"karma\" of masters does not bind their liberated souls, \nbut rather serves as earth ties that cling loosely to saviors who choose \nto spend their freedom doing good on earth, either from God's heav-\nenly kingdom or by periodic reincarnations. Their human karma may \nbe said to be like burnt rope; it appears to bind, but when so willed it \nfalls away in ashes. \nJesus was conscious throughout his mission that according to the \nlaw of cause and effect his divine works and words (taking the karma \nof many he cured and offending the laws of both religious and secular \nauthorities) would surely lead to crucifixion of his body.

The omnipresent Christ Consciousness, which appeared in \nthe consciousness of this body of Jesus, will henceforth remain unman-\nifested to you until through meditation you expand your own con-\nsciousness sufficiently to say, 'Blessed is he (the bliss-filled Christ Con-\nsciousness) who cometh (is revealed to the intuitive perception of the \ndevotee who has attuned himself) in the name of the Lord (through the \nHoly Ghost Aum Vibration, heard in the inner stillness of meditation).' \nThe Christ Consciousness, which became manifest in me in this age, will \nmanifest a second time in your meditation-expanded consciousness. \nThen and then only will you be able to realize my true infinite nature, \nas well as have a vision of my body in which Christ Consciousness has \nbeen templed.\" \n* \"Stoning the prophets\" is recounted in II Chronicles 24:17-21 (cited in Discourse \n55).

Likewise Spirit, being both Father and Mother, is not only \naware of the loss when one of His children wanders from His king-\ndom and knows objectively that that soul by cosmic law will in time \nreturn to Him; but also as the loving Mother, God feelingly desires to \nrecover that child from delusion. Unconditionally, wholeheartedly, \nGod loves His untold generations of children and becomes anxious \nwhen even one of them becomes temporarily lost. \nThe great love of God for his devotees is beautifully and won-\ndrously expressed by Jesus in the revelation that the Lord, with His \nliberated angels and saints in heaven, rejoices when a sinning child re-\npents of his follies and makes sincere effort to return to God's king-\ndom. This is illustrated also in the parable of the prodigal son as told \nby Jesus: \nAnd he said, \"A certain man had two sons: and the younger of \nthem said to his father, 'Father, give me the portion of goods that \nfalleth to me.' And he divided unto them his living. And not \nmany days after the younger son gathered all together, and took \nhis journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance \nwith riotous living. \n\"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in \nthat land; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined \nhimself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his \nfields to feed swine. And he would fain have filled his belly with \nthe husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. \n\"And when he came to himself, he said, 'How many hired \nservants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I \nperish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say \nunto him, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, \nand am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of \nthy hired servants.'\" And he arose, and came to his father. But \nwhen he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had \ncompassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. \n\"And the son said unto him, 'Father, I have sinned against \nheaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called \nthy son.'

And he \ncalled one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. \nAnd he said unto him, 'Thy brother is come; and thy father hath \nkilled the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and \nsound.' \n\"And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his \nfather out, and entreated him.

The \nmeaning of the para-\nyounger devotee was proud to possess the wealth of \nble of the prodigal son \nwisdom that fell to his lot and became overly con-\nfident and careless.

When he was long in delusion, under the influ-\nence of bad company, he encountered the mighty famine of inner suf-\nfering and longed to be nourished again by some food of wisdom, but \ncould not find it in his drought-stricken life. \n\"He sought refuge with a good man who had devoted himself to \ndisciplining a few unruly animalistic souls ('swine') by training them \nwith some elementary moral instructions.

The Heavenly Father is glad because your younger \nerring brother has regained his heavenly consciousness and is safe \nfrom long imprisonment in the karmic cycles of reincarnation.' \n\"When the elder devotee heard this he was puzzled and would not \ngo near the presence of the Father. Therefore the Cosmic Conscious-\nness approached him through his intuition with some spiritual \nthoughts and inner perceptions. But the elder devotee in his vision vi-\nbrated his perplexity: 'Heavenly Father, behold these many years I \nhave honored and worshiped Thee faithfully in Cosmic Conscious-\nness; never have I broken Thy commandments nor transgressed Thy \ndivine laws by even a desire for sense attachment, yet Thou never gave \nme such a demonstration of Thy blessings.

He \ntouches the Lord with his heart's love and feels Him as joy; his pure \nlove entices God to manifest Himself on the altar of the perception of \npeace. The advancing devotee feels God not only in meditation, but \nkeeps Him always on the altar of peace in his heart. \nIn the temple of samadhi, oneness with the peace that is God's \nfirst manifestation in meditation, the devotee finds a state of ever new \nbliss, a joy that never grows stale. Bliss is a much deeper state than \npeace. As a mute person drinking nectar imbibes but cannot describe \nthe ambrosial flavor, so the rapture of bliss found in the temple of \nsamadhi moves the experiencer to wordless eloquence. That joy alone \ncan satisfy the innate craving of the human heart. In patient, persis-\ntent meditation, day after day, year after year, the devotee lovingly de-\nmands of his Lord: \"Come to me as joy in samadhi-oneness, \nand re-\nmain forever in my heart on the altar of bliss!\" When in our hearts, \nin harmony with the hearts of all who love God in the interior temple \nof silence and bliss, we rejoice in the joy of our one Beloved, that \nunited joy is a vast altar of God. \nIt is incumbent on man as a soul to practice that inner silence; to \nfind God now. In the use of the senses amid the exigencies of daily \nlife, the devotee holds to the consciousness: \"I am sitting on the \npeace throne of inner silence.\" In the midst of activity, he remains in-\nwardly recollected: \"I am the god of silence sitting on the throne of \neach action.\" His equanimity is upset by no unruly feelings: \"I am the \nprince of silence sitting on the throne of poise.\" His inner Self, at one \nwith eternity, in life and in death rejoices: \"I am the king of immor-\ntality reigning on the throne of silence.

But He thought within Himself: \"Verily, I am Joy; but \nthere is none to enjoy Me.\" As He thought this, He became divided \ninto Creator and created, Transcendent Spirit and Cosmic Vibratory \nNature.

Reason, being aggressive, made man \npositive with positive sexual processes; and woman, with deep feeling, \nwas negative and thus formed deep sexual recesses.* \nThe ideal spiritual union between man and woman was ordained \nthat man might bring out the hidden reason in woman, and that the \nwoman might help man uncover his hidden feeling. By so aiding each \nother to develop a perfect balance of these pure divine soul qualities, \nthey would transcend their delusive differentiation as man and woman \nand realize their true nature as inviolate souls. Liberation was to be \naccomplished by their becoming united first to each other in divine \nfriendship, the purest expression of God's love shared between two in-\ndividuals; and then, thus perfected, ready for the ultimate union with \nGod. \nIt is clear from Jesus' references to Genesis in these verses that he \nwas citing the law of true soul mates, the immutable law of spiritual \nlove, which should motivate all marriages. This was, as Jesus empha-\nsized, the divine law \"at the beginning\": that for every true man there \nwas a true woman, and each one who lived rightly on earth would au-\ntomatically be drawn together in soul-companionship with a mate by \nthe operation and decree of this law.

From the vibra-\ntion of God-force that created man, or Adam, manifesting a reason-\npredominant nature, God drew forth a rib or feeling-predominant vi-\nbration to create woman. \n*Cf. commentary on Mark 12:25 (pages 12.16 ff.): \"For when they shall rise from the \ndead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in \nheaven.\" \n1200 \n"}

After Master had made these points, \nhe concluded, \"Remember that he who rejects the usual worldly duties \ncan justify himself only by assuming some kind of responsibility for a \nmuch larger family.\" \nI started with a residential school that quickly grew into a family \nof three hundred children. I cared for them as father-mother-friend-\nspiritual instructor. I was on call to their needs day and night. I had \nnever imagined in all my dreams what our parents go through for us. \nThe mother sleeps just a little bit; and then the baby wakes up and \ncries, and the mother has to renounce her need for rest to respond. \nWith what patience and tender love most of our mothers have raised \nus, and the sacrifices our fathers made to support us. We do not real-\nize that until we have children of our own. If we do not choose fam-\nily life, that does not condone a selfish existence. Those who are sin-\ngle can work out their evolution by extending their interests in service \nto others among God's children. The propagation of the species means \nnot only to give birth through one's own body, but to leave in others \nsomething of one's nobler ideals and example—just as it is the duty \nof parents to instill the better part of themselves in their children. The \nteacher does likewise; he leaves to posterity his thoughts and ideas \npropagated in others. An exemplary life of service and love for God is \na divine inheritance bequeathed to the world. \nThe privilege of life God has given to us bears with it a great re-\nsponsibility. I well understood what this entailed when I identified my \nlife with caring for the children of my How-to-Live School. They \nmetaphorically took half of my life; half of my salvation I had to give \nto them. Now with the many souls God has sent into my large world \nfamily, I save nothing for myself. My gain is in my loss for others, be-\ncause they are my own self. This is the way to liberate oneself in un-\nmarried life, uniting feeling and reason—love and will — by giving \noneself to others, just as Jesus did. For those who are able to receive \nJesus' edict to remain unmarried \"for the kingdom of heaven's sake,\" \nservice to humanity is their work. Their obligation is to be even more \nbusy than are family members in their compact unit of society. \nBy God-contact in meditation and selfless service that gives birth \nin others to some of one's noblest ideas, one not only unites feeling \nand reason in oneself, but cultures in one's expanded family of spiri-\ntual children, feeling to balance the reason in men, and reason to bal-\nance the feeling in women.

Human experi-\nences of marriage, love, success, study, meditation, exercise, discipline, \nall are necessary to produce the fruit of Self-realization.

It is behavior governed by \nthe recognition of the One Life omnipresent in all beings. It is the in-\nspiration to be helpful and serviceful to others, without which one is \ntacitly, in some way, doing harm to them by such omission. Murder is \nhighlighted as a heinous form of injury, a mortal offense to the In-\ndwelling Spirit. Murder is committed through identification with \ngreed, selfishness, anger—all of which are satanic qualities and de-\nstroy the consciousness of soul peace. To kill is to perpetuate the evil \nexample of killing, inviting wrath and impulses of murderous revenge \nfrom the relatives and friends of the victim and the aggregate social \nconscience. To kill is to destroy the God-created temple of life be-\nlonging to the soul. A life cut short deprives man of the karmic learn-\ning experiences by which the soul can expand its influence and spiri-\ntualize the temple of life to find God therein. It is a cruelty that inflicts \ngreat suffering on a brother soul. Such cruelty to others creates an \nalienation between the perpetrator and God. \n\"Thou shalt not commit adultery\" is elevated by Patanjali to its \npurest connotation as brahmacharya, \n\"continence, self-restraint.\" Pro-\nmiscuous behavior, in or out of wedlock, is abuse of Nature's sacred \ncreative force, limiting the consciousness to identification with the \nphysical body with loss of the consciousness of the soul's transcendent \nomnipresence. \n\"Thou shalt not steal\" is closely allied to another of the Ten Com-\nmandments, \"Thou shalt not covet...anything that is thy neighbour's.\" \nCorresponding to these are Patanjali's proscriptions of asteya, refer-\nring to any form of misappropriation; and aparigraha, \n\"noncovetous-\nness\"—absence of greed and possessiveness.

Jesus had been liberated long before his advent in \nthat incarnation; he came as a special messenger of the Heavenly Fa-\nther and to give demonstrative evidence of an exemplary life on earth. \nAs his mission was ofttimes contrary to the political and socioreligious \nlaws and traditions of his times, Jesus saw how the karmic law of ac-\ntion and its effects would mandate his crucifixion; he also foresaw his \nGod-ordained glorious resurrection. Thus the Father permitted him to \nreveal these events to his disciples. Though the import of his words \n\"was hid from them\" at the time, their truth would echo as the fore-\ntold events were made manifest. \nIt is significant that Jesus did not say \"the Son of God shall be de-\nlivered.\" \"Son of man\" referred to his human body; his God-united \nChrist consciousness (\"Son of God\"), being immortal and invulnera-\nble, was subject to no such iniquity. \nAnd Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.

He was not extolling the personal devo-\ntion given him by Mary, but was commending her sagacity in \nworshiping the great God of the universe whose presence he con-\nsciously felt in his Christ Consciousness. He pointed out impartially \nMary's wisdom in offering adoration to the holiest of all holy mani-\nfestations: the Christ Consciousness that was templed in him—the liv-\ning reflection of the One Giver of all life, all consciousness, and all \nvirtue, including charitable impulses to help the poor. Thus when Ju-\ndas and others of materialistic attitude and hypocritical morality as-\nserted that Mary would have done better had she sold the ointment \nand used the income to aid the poor, Jesus reminded them that they \nhave a perpetual opportunity to attend to the poor, but they would not \nreadily have another chance of showing devotion to a visible manifes-\ntation of God's presence in a bodily form; for such is a rare occurrence \non earth. \nJesus' words emphasize that devotees should wisely grade their \nspiritual duties and righteous actions, keeping God as the first and \nsupreme object of adoration. Mary with her instinctive divine devo-\ntion knew exactly what she was doing—that, first, it was her sacred \nprivilege to honor the visible Christ in whom was the reflected mani-\nfestation of God; and, secondly, to serve God in others. She did not \nhesitate to anoint her Lord with the costly ointment, knowing that \nthere is nothing in this world precious enough to show adequate rev-\nerence to the Supreme Beloved of all souls. \nJesus saw clearly how men's minds are open to every form of side-\ntracking, prone to any commandeering by a detail. There is only one \nproblem in human life—establishment of unity with God—but this \nprime simplicity has been befogged by a million issues. Man will not \ngive a monotheistic love to God, and disguises his infidelities by punc-\ntilious respect before outward shrines of charity.

Zechariah spoke \ntruly of a Messiah who would \"cut off the chariot...the horse...and \nthe battle bow...he shall speak peace unto the heathen.\" \nThe Prince of Peace, whose only battle cry could be: Victory to \nthe Meek! rode no fiery charger amidst a panoplied army, but sat a \ngentle steed, small and serviceable to the daily ways of peace.

He goes on to say: \n\"The contemporary Roman historian Procopius wrote of the climate changes as 'a \nmost dread portent.' In describing the climate that year, Procopius wrote that 'the sun \ngave forth its light without brightness like the moon during this whole year.' Other ac-\ncounts of the event say that the sun became 'dim' or 'dark' for up to eighteen months. \nIts light shone 'like a feeble shadow,' and people were terrified.\" \nKeys cites similar accounts from historical records of Arabia, China, Japan, and \nother countries, as well as scientific evidence such as analysis of tree-ring growth in \nnorthern and western Europe and North America, where \"trees virtually stopped \ngrowing in the years 536 and 542-43\" and did not return to normal until more than \ntwenty years later. \n*See also Discourse 73, commentary on Matthew 26:64: \"Hereafter shall ye see the \nSon of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\" \n1313 \n"}

In any case, Jesus and the disciples in the aura of \nhis blessings were in such an advanced state of consciousness that a \nlittle wine could have no ill effect on them; they were under the in-\nfluence only of the wine of ecstasy in the ever new joyous contact with \nGod. Grossly inferior material intoxicants stimulate the senses, oblit-\nerate reason, and bring spiritual degradation. Satan invented the \ntemptation of wine and sensual indulgence to delude people with \ncounterfeit substitutes for the infinitely satisfying bliss of God-contact \nfound in deep meditation. Seekers of divine ecstasy are adjured to ab-\nstain strictly from inebriating substances and sensual stimulants, \nwhich keep the life force and consciousness bound in body con-\nsciousness and easily become habit-forming. Sense-enslaved persons \nwho are controlled by habits of wine or sex find themselves unable to \npartake of the supersensory, supremely intoxicating ecstasy of God-\ncommunion. \nThe contents of the cup offered to the disciples was charged by \nJesus with his divine vibrations of Holy Ghost Cosmic Energy, that the \ndisciples might feel an upliftment and purification as they celebrated \ntogether the rites of Passover (liberation from bondage).* \n* The Feast of the Passover, one of the principal holy festivals of the Jewish year, com-\nmemorates the deliverance of the people from their bondage in Egypt. As recounted in \nthe Book of Exodus, God said to Moses: \n\"I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep \nin bondage; and I have remembered My covenant. Wherefore say unto the children of \nIsrael, 'I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyp-\ntians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched \nout arm, and with great judgments: And I will take you to Me for a people, and I will \nbe to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you \nout from under the burdens of the Egyptians'\" (Exodus 6:5-7). \nThe Biblical account relates that it took ten devastating plagues, prophesied by \nMoses, to convince the Pharoah to release the Israelites. The final punishment was the \nsudden death of the firstborn son of each Egyptian household. God had told Moses to \nhave each Israelite family, on the specified day, prepare a meal of lamb, unleavened \nbread, and bitter herbs—and to daub the doorway of their homes with the blood of \nthe lamb. \"For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth \nthe blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door, \nand will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. \n\"And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for \never....It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, who passed over the houses of the chil-\ndren of Israel in Egypt, when He smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses\" (Ex-\nodus 12:23-24, 27). \n1343 \n"}

Thereby, you will have found the way to \nliberation from suffering the cause-effect consequences of your past sin-\nful actions.\" \nJesus spoke of his sacrifice on the cross as the cup,*' and of the spir-\nitual lesson involved in his crucifixion as the contents of the cup of sac-\nrifice. When he asked his disciples to drink all of that cup, he did not \nmean that literal physical crucifixion is necessary in order to know God \n—nor that physical crucifixion alone bestows Christhood. To manifest \nhis exalted state, Jesus had crucified ignorance by wisdom, restlessness \nby meditation, desires by renunciation, sense temptations by interior-\nization of his consciousness, hatred by love, selfishness by unselfishness, \nbefore he was ready to take on victoriously the sufferings of the cross. \nThese are the important prerequisites to Christhood. Anyone who can \ncrucify physical attachment by God-communion will reach the state \nwherein even bodily crucifixion, in whatever form, can be endured, if \nnecessary, for God and truth. \nJesus' request that his disciples share the cup, therefore, was an ex-\nhortation to absorb into their own being his \"blood of the new testa-\nment\" that would awaken in them the Christ Consciousness-imbued \nqualities of his exemplary life. His selfless sacrifice on the cross was the \nultimate demonstration of his immortality-bestowing teachings of for-\ngiveness, divine love, unshakable fortitude, wisdom, judgment, will \npower, supreme love of God, love and compassion for God's children, \novercoming brute force by spiritual force, self-surrender (supplanting \nthe wishes of the little ego-self by obedience to the will of God). \nIn saying that his blood was to be \"shed for many for the remis-\nsion of sins,\" Jesus never meant that his crucifixion could wash away \nthe sins of mere \"believers\" for all time to come. Such a possibility \nsuggests a profound nonunderstanding of the complexity of \"sin\" \nand its roots in the universal law of karma. Obtaining forgiveness is \n*As he also prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane before his trial: \"Father, if Thou be \nwilling, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but Thine, be done\" (Luke \n22:42). \n1345 \n"}

But it \nis a metaphysical error to think that merely because of professed be-\nlief in Jesus as Savior, one can feel free to act in any way one pleases \nwithin variably broad moral constraints—behaving in worldly ways \nand clinging to material desires and attachments—and yet be saved \nfrom after-death consequences by the sacrifice Jesus made on the \ncross nineteen hundred years ago. The awe-inspiring selflessness of \nhis suffering and death no doubt absorbed and mitigated much of the \nkarma of his disciples.* However, in his reference to the remission \nof sins Jesus was stating primarily that the extraordinary example of \nhis sacrifice on the cross, through which he attained complete liber-\nation in Cosmic Consciousness—freedom from the willingly accepted \nbonds of his mortal incarnation—would serve to inspire earnest \ntruth-seekers to forsake inferior material attachments for the supreme \nattainment of God-consciousness.

Dur-\ning the original Passover each Hebrew family sacrificed and partook of \nthe flesh of a lamb, and the lamb's blood with which they marked their \nhomes procured their safety during the divine punishment visited upon \nthe Egyptians. Jesus used the familiar symbology of the Passover rites to \ndeclare the new testament, the covenant brought to the world through \nhis life. Jesus would not have alluded to a practice even metaphorically \nequated to a concept of cannibalism [as cited in Discourse 43]. \nPeople desecrate the name of Jesus more than honor it by such su-\nperstition. He showed again and again that his \"body\" was not him-\nself. He was Spirit; he could pass through walls and walk on water be-\ncause he knew the real substance of his form to be consciousness. So \n\"flesh of Christ\" means his consciousness. \"Blood\" means the life of \nChrist, the Holy Ghost Cosmic Energy that is the life and the light of \nhis little body called Jesus and his cosmic body of the universe. The out-\nward ritual of symbolically celebrating the Lord's Supper or Holy Com-\nmunion with bread and wine blesses sincere churchgoers with devo-\ntional upliftment and inspiration; but those who have true communion \nwith Christ can perceive Jesus not merely in a ritualistic symbolic form, \nbut in his formless infinitude as one with the all-pervading Christ Con-\nsciousness and universal light of the Holy Ghost Cosmic Energy. * \nTeresa of Avila spoke of seeing the formless Christ. She was much \npersecuted by the church officials for this abstruse assertion, until they \ndiscovered that centuries earlier the great church philosopher Saint \nThomas Aquinas had also written of communion with the formless \nChrist. The body of Jesus was only a little speck of matter, but behind \nthat was the infinite Christ Consciousness and the infinite energy of \nVibratory Cosmic Light, f \n* Bhagavan Krishna, the Christ of India, declared: \"Whoever realizes Me to be the Un-\nborn and Beginningless as well as the Sovereign Lord of Creation—that man has con-\nquered delusion and attained the sinless state even while wearing a mortal body\" (God \nTalks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita \ntSee Teresa's description of her vision of the formless Christ, Discourse 53.

The species expressa is the reaction \nof the mind as a cognitive process. The former is impressed in the faculty which it de-\ntermines, and corresponds to the passive phase of knowledge which is a necessary \ncondition but is not yet actual knowledge. The latter is the active response of the fac-\nulty, the cognitive process itself by which the mind reaches the object....In the beatific \nvision God's essence takes the place not only of the species impressa, but also of the \nspecies \nexpressa.\" \nIn familiar terms relevant to his knowledge, Aquinas echoed the truth of ecstatic \nrealization voiced by the great sage Patanjali in his Yoga Sutras 1:17-18. \"He refers to \ntwo basic categories of samadhi: (1) samprajnata and (2) asamprajnata,\" Paramahansa \nYogananda explains in God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita. \"When used to \ndefine the preliminary stages of realization rather than its advanced states of fulfill-\nment, then samprajnata and asamprajnata are relative terms used to distinguish initial \nsupersensory experiences in meditation (samprajnata) from true samadhi or union with \nthe object of meditation (asamprajnata). Samprajnata then refers to those primary \nstates wherein the object of meditation is 'known accurately or thoroughly' through \nintuition that is still somewhat mixed with, or interpreted by, nature's subtle instru-\nments of perception—an interaction of the knower, the knowing, and the known....By \ncontrast, asamprajnata then means those superconscious experiences that are perceived \nthrough pure intuition or realization—the direct perception of the soul by being one \nwith the object of meditation—transcendent of any intervening instrument or princi-\nple of nature.\" (Publisher's Note) \n* First Epistle of St. John, 1:5-7. \n1349 \n"}

As explained earlier [Discourses 25, 35, 46, 57, \nThe law of karma in \nand 66], Jesus was fully aware that his death \"was de- \nrelation to Jesus' cru-\ntermined\" karmically by his own actions: taking onto \ncifixion and the fate \nhimself the burden of many sins of his disciples and \nof his betrayer \nfollowers, and inviting retaliation by his defiance of \nthe man-made laws of the social and religious hierarchy. The scriptures \npredicted the ordeal of Jesus because the prophets intuitively calculated \nthe karmic effect to be incurred in carrying out his God-given mission. \nJesus himself made it clear that he could have chosen at any time, even \nup to the moment of his crucifixion, to avert his fate. It was his own free \nchoice, gladly made, to offer himself in supreme sacrifice for the healing \nand ultimate salvation of many by alleviation of their karmic burden. \nJesus' words in the above verses emphasized that Judas, too, must \nperforce bear the responsibility as well as the consequences of his own \nchoices. The karmic law would decree fearsome retribution on Judas \nfor voluntarily choosing to act as a tool of Satan's delusion and evil in \nbetrayal of his God-given master. Jesus readily bestowed understand-\ning and forgiveness on the woman taken in adultery, telling her ac-\ncusers, \"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at \nher.\" And on the cross he asked God's mercy even for those who car-\nried out his torturous execution. But of the traitor Judas he said: \"Woe \nto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! Good were it for \nthat man if he had never been born.\" Clearly, treachery is an extreme \nsin. Man's culpability in sins of the flesh is mitigated because he is en-\nslaved by the maya-imposed compulsion of the senses. But treachery \nis deliberate, willful — the most heinous sin before the tribunal of \nGod's cosmic law. One who vows loyalty to his guru, and then breaks \nthat vow in an act of betrayal, commits the ultimate treachery. God's \nlaws deal severely with anyone who thus turns against one's God-sent \nmessenger; it is thereby a betrayal of God Himself. \nYet even in such an egregious case of wrongdoing, Jesus did not for-\nsake this soul he had accepted long before as one of his spiritual sons in \nthe unconditional divine relationship of guru and disciple. Though the \nkarmic law decreed that Judas's act as Satan's agent would destine him \nto return to the earth to learn painful lessons in many reincarnations, I \nknow from authentic information that Judas at last attained salvation \n1351 \n"}

Pri-\nmarily, it was to show them the ideal of humbleness expressed in \nselfless service. \"You call me Lord of creation and Master or Guru; \nand you say it truthfully, for so I am because of my Father's wish.

He assured the disciples that if they un-\nderstood and remembered the lessons he had taught them, and gov-\nerned their lives accordingly, they would realize the immutable spiritual \nhappiness of a life sheltered in the pure humility of selflessness. \nEven the Heavenly Father serves impartially in silent humbleness: \nHe has created the water in the well, and as the indwelling Spirit in the \nwater and in every person, it is He who washes the feet of His children \n571 \n"}

This is made evident by his saying, in effect: \"He who is spir-\nitually washed needs only an occasional physical cleansing to be clean \nin every way. Most of you are spiritually clean, but not all of you.\" \nThus he dramatically foretold his knowledge of the betrayal of Judas. \n\"I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that \nthe scripture may be fulfilled, 'He that eateth bread with me hath \nlifted up his heel against me.'f Now I tell you before it come, \nthat, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he. \n\"Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever \nI send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth Him that \nsent me.\" \n* Washing his disciples' feet also afforded Jesus the opportunity to impart to them pu-\nrifying blessings through the magnetic exchange of vibratory energy. As explained ear-\nlier, the hands and feet function as positive and negative poles which when contacted \ngenerate a flow of subtle currents of life force. In the time-honored custom of touch-\ning the feet of great souls, the disciple is the negative pole that is surcharged with di-\nvine power from the master who is the positive pole. When Jesus washed the feet of \nhis disciples he operated this same law, the meeting of positive and negative poles— \nwith himself as the positive, the disciples as the negative—and thereby through the \ntouch of his hands blessed the disciples with spiritually purifying vibrations. \nt\"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath \nlifted up his heel against me\" (Psalms 41:9). \n572 \n"}

Jesus merely stated that his divine intuition detected the \nmalign thoughts of Judas whose intent was to betray him, being un-\nder the influence of satanic delusion.* \nThe love of God that characterized the greatness of Jesus re-\nsponded to the pure immediacy of John's devotion, so that notwith-\nstanding the usual reserve in the presence of divinity, this beloved dis-\nciple was often allowed by Jesus to lean on his breast—as would a \nchild seeking succor from its mother. This divinely human nature of \nJesus, an avatar in whom God was fully manifest, was so tenderly lov-\ning that it shows how intimately personal is the love of God that can \nbe received by anyone who loves God deeply, as John did. The love \nshown by Jesus is the love of God; this Jesus expressed in one of his \ngreatest sermons, when he said (in the next series of verses): \"A new \ncommandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have \nloved you.\" Jesus thus conveyed to the disciples that he loved them as \nGod loved them; and that it was of no use for them to love him with a \nselfish love that did not include love for one another as he loved them. \nDivine love is a transcending power, elevating and all-embracing; mun-\ndane love is self-seeking and circumscriptive. Jesus taught his disciples \nnot only to feel God as the great manifestation of love and ever new \njoy in meditation, but also to love God in His tangible presence in the \ntemples of human bodies. \nIn answer to John's query as to the identity of the betrayer among \nthem, Jesus said he would point out the malefactor by giving him a \npiece of bread he had dipped. Jesus' words after giving the bread to \nJudas signified: \n\"O Judas Iscariot, you are possessed by satanic cosmic delusion \ndue to your evil karma; therefore, do quickly what you have made up \nyour mind to do and get it over with, lest you harbor your evil impulse \nlonger and become ready to do greater evil.\" \n* See also Discourse 69, explanation of karma and free choice in the context of Luke \n2:2:2.1-23. \n574 \n"}

The divine nature of that Self is clearly perceived as soon \nas the heart, the responses of feeling, becomes perfectly calm. This is \nwhat Jesus intended, advising his disciples to take the entirety of human \nexperiences calmly, like the Oriental yogi, without forming egoistic likes \nand dislikes—attraction to what is pleasant, aversion to what is painful \nor difficult. \nSouls are sent on earth by God to watch His cosmic motion pic-\nture with a calm, nonattached consciousness befitting souls made in \n* Yoga Sutras 1:2.

That is why Jesus and Self-realized yogis advise all truth-\nseekers to pass through trials, fortunes and misfortunes, struggling for \nrighteousness with an undisturbed state of heart, as the way of at-\ntaining salvation, Cosmic Consciousness.* \nThus when Jesus says, \"In my Father's house are many man-\nsions,\" he warns his disciples that unless they attain Cosmic Con-\nsciousness, after death they would have to dwell on \none of the variously graded planes of existence \nwhere unredeemed souls go according to their mer-\nits and demerits. His promise, \"I go to prepare a \nplace for you,\" refers to the fact that the blessings \nof a true guru can help his disciples to gain a better \nplace in the many-mansioned vibratory spheres in \nthe after-death state. In my autobiography I have recounted how, dur-\ning my experience of the resurrection of my guru, Swami Sri Yuktes-\nwarji, he described his dwelling as a savior in a supernal region of the \nastral heaven inhabited by souls who have overcome earthly ties.

Thereby their consciousness would expand into the om-\nnipresence of Christ Consciousness, \"receive you unto myself,\" through \nwhich they would attain final liberation in Cosmic Consciousness. \nWhen Jesus says, \"Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know,\" \nhe reminds his disciples that the abode of Christ Consciousness is om-\nnipresence, and the way to that abode lies in the art of keeping the \nheart untroubled by earthly experiences, remaining settled in the om-\nnipresent Christ Consciousness in the soul, and thereby uniting human \nconsciousness with Cosmic Consciousness. \nThomas saith unto him, \"Lord, we know not whither thou goest; \nand how can we know the way?\" \nJesus saith unto him, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life: \nno man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

The devotee at first has moments of intuitive \nperceptions of Cosmic Consciousness dwelling within his soul, and in \ntime learns to be aware of it constantly. \nFinally, Jesus told the beloved advanced disciples that although his \nbody would soon be gone, yet he would leave with them the art of \ncontacting the great comforting Bliss present in Cosmic Vibration; and \nthrough that contact, the Christ Consciousness would be revealed to \nthem a second time. \n\"Yet a little while my body will be present in the world, and then \nthe world shall lose sight of this body and the Christ Consciousness in \nit.

So it is today with all who utter prayers to the Holy Ghost and \nChrist without ever realizing them in their consciousness. They are sat-\nisfied with ceremonies that they believe bring the contact of Holy Ghost \nand Christ.

Any devotee who wants to bring Christ Intelligence a second \ntime in his consciousness and through that Christ-wisdom reach the \nFather, or the Cosmic Consciousness, must first master the technique \nof communing with the Holy Ghost Cosmic Sound, and then realize \nthe Christ Intelligence in it. Simply believing in the Trinity could not \ngive anyone the God-realization of Cosmic Consciousness. \nThe Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibration appears to the devotee during \nmeditation as Cosmic Light, Cosmic Sound, Cosmic Joy, and Cosmic \nWisdom.

When one can express the almighty power of intoxicating \ndivine love, it awakens the living heart of God's love in the lives of \nothers. \nThe preeminent instinct in man is to love himself first. When there \nis danger of any kind, one's first impulse is to save oneself. Spiritual-\nity begins with the effort to place the well-being of someone else above \none's own interests.

What greater consolation could one receive, than to \nfind that when one's devotion is strong and incessant the Inconceiv-\nable Infinite manifests in the visible form of guru?

That is why he is not available to mankind, except through the \nsilent bestowal of his blessings. Though ever-living, he is ever-hiding.* \nSo is Jesus. Whether with a body or without, liberated souls are ever-\nliving in Spirit. They can openly appear anytime and anywhere they \nwish, but are not allowed to remain visibly accessible to the masses. \nGod does not permit any master to do that, for it would create a com-\npulsion that would disrupt the cosmic order based on man's free will. \nPeople would idolize the phenomenal personality and forget the Spirit. \nThey would attempt to confine God to a human form and compla-\ncently neglect to seek His omnipresent, immortal, formless Self. Fur-\nthermore, the general populace would flock to that one prophet, but \nthe many who disbelieved in that particular divine aspect would be left \nbehind. God does not want that; through His various emissaries He \nfulfills His commitment to the needs of all His children on all evolu-\ntionary levels.

God will pull me away.\" None would presume to tamper with \nGod's ways. \nThere are millions of Christians who know Jesus the Christ as a \ndivine historical personage; they worship his image and they worship \nthe cross as his symbol. But those who adore Jesus solely as a person-\nality do not know Christ as a savior. Of the many who call themselves \nChristians, not all have been accepted by Christ. Those who show the \nvaliancy of spirit and continuity of prayer and meditation necessary to \ncommune with the Infinite Consciousness, they are the accepted ones \nwho know Christ as savior. \nTo perceive the formless Christ is the greatest Christ-ianity—to \nbehold not just a man encaged in a little body-frame, but the efful-\ngence of Christ glory spread over the stars and wheeling universes, \nshining in every atom and throb of vibratory force.

Jesus did not men-\ntion the betrayal to torment Judas, nor to provide him with a justifi-\ncation of inevitability, but to warn him against the treachery that his \nkarma was fomenting within him. Through his omniscient knowledge, \nJesus scanned the inner nature of Judas and his karma of past incar-\nnations, and thus lovingly gave Judas a chance to change his malevo-\nlent karmic pattern. \nJesus had said: \"Woe to that man by whom the Son of man is be-\ntrayed! Good were it for that man if he had never been born.\"f Jesus \nthereby told Judas that he would reap untold misery by choosing to \nbetray him. But Judas was so intoxicated with the delusion of his own \npreconceived ambitions that he ignored the opportunity to save him-\nself from evil and went ahead with the work of betrayal. It is clearly \nseen in this drama of events that man is the architect of his own des-\ntiny; he is free to act as he pleases, for good or ill. \nfor they feared the people. Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of \nthe number of the twelve. \n\"And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he \nmight betray him unto them.

Nevertheless, Ju-\ndas had within him a plenteous store of good karma by which he at-\ntracted in his present life the blessing of close association with Jesus. \nAs a spiritual doctor, Jesus diagnosed the life of Judas as a com-\nposite of his good and evil actions and tendencies in many incarna-\ntions.

He preferred that the high \npriest receive their testimony rather than defend his teachings himself. \nAlso, he was disappointed that his disciples had left him at his hour of \ntrial; he wanted to find out if any were left who would stand up for him. \nOf course, Jesus did not mean that he never gave private spiritual \ninstruction to his disciples. To his closest advanced disciples he taught \nthe esoteric science of meditation, giving to them \"in secret\" what the \ngeneral populace in that dark era was not spiritually prepared to un-\nderstand— \"Therefore speak I to them in parables.\"* So when Jesus \nsaid, \"In secret have I said nothing,\" he meant that nothing he had \nsaid or taught, in public or in private, was evil and needed to be con-\ncealed—nor had he ever covertly conspired against the country's laws. \nWhen one of the officers struck him for his reply, Jesus meekly and \nyet firmly displayed his impeccable spiritual character. Jesus, who had \npower over all creation through his Christ Consciousness, who had \nraised the dead and healed the sick, and to whose prayers the Heavenly \nFather Himself replied through the clouds, was yet humbly nonresis-\ntant to the ignominious slap of an ignorant little man.

Even as he had by a mere word caused the fig tree to \nwither, so could he have removed the life from his enemies in Jerusalem, \nor from all the people in the world if such a course were necessary and \nproper. Instead, Jesus, like God, behaved with humility, and meekly \nsubmitted his great self to the tyranny of a few wicked people.

He comes out of His hiding place in human desires and the folly \nof delusion and lives on the altar of the devotee's conscious devotion. \nThus when in the mordant gloom of physical pain Jesus felt the per-\nsonal contact of God slip away, he prayed, \" M y God, You whom I \nhave known consciously to belong to me always, why have You for-\nsaken me?\" \nThat mortal consciousness of separation from God was Satan's test \nof delusion, opportunely seized upon when God had slipped away to \nsee if Jesus would miss Him.

In a poetic sense it \ncan be said that when Jesus, who was omnisciently present in the cos-\nmos as well as in the temple, passed away and was lost to the physi-\ncal gaze of the world, even the temple veil could not hide its sorrow: \nits atoms burst forth and let loose their hidden grief—as did the trem-\nbling earth and the darkened sun. \nDuring earthly existence an ordinary individual is only conscious of \nhis body, which, moving from one place to another, sees during the state \nof wakefulness different portions of materially circumscribed space. \nHowever, even the ordinary individual during the state of sleep perceives \nthe higher power of mind working in dreams, unfettered by constraints \nof the normal laws of physics; and also, during the state of deep dream-\nless sleep, a limited sphere of the quiescent joy of the soul. In contrast, \nthe Christlike person, even during earthly existence, sees not only limited \nportions of space through his physical eyes, but also beholds through his \nspiritual eye of intuition the entire manifested cosmos, illumined by the \nastral light and Christ Consciousness, with all the planets and stars like \nglowworms glimmering in the immeasurable vastness of space-time. \nNevertheless, even a saint with Christ Consciousness has certain \nlimitations, in that his awareness embraces all creation—the inconceiv-\nably varied maya-show of forms and forces interacting in the cosmic ma-\ntrix of sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic qualities—but not the vibrationless \ntranscendent realm where the Creator Himself abides. In the Bhagavad \nGita, the Lord declares: \"It is difficult indeed to go beyond the influence \nof My divine cosmic hypnosis, imbued with the triple qualities. Only \nthose who take shelter in Me become free from this power of illusion.\"* \nJesus Christ demonstrated the utmost fulfillment of this divine promise, \nlifting his God-surrendered soul into full transcendence with the words: \n\"Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.\" \n* God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita vil:i4. \n1489 \n"}

Great \nsaints and masters in transcendent states of samadhi can commune \nwith the Father present in all creation, but when they reach the final \nstate their \"communion\" is oneness with the Absolute within and be-\nyond creation. \nCosmic Consciousness or God the Father exists in its pure state \nbeyond all creation, and in secret as the Christ Consciousness in all \ncreation. Spirit, in order to manifest creation, divides Itself into the \nFather-Creator who transcends creation, the Son or reflected Christ \nConsciousness within creation, and Cosmic Vibration or Holy Ghost, \nthe substance of creation. Since God has thus created Himself into \nthese three aspects, and into the cosmos and all its creatures, human \nbeings seeking to reunite with Him first have to rise by meditation \nfrom the consciousness of plurality to the consciousness of trinity: \nHoly Ghost, Christ Consciousness, and God the Father. After that, the \ndevotee must attain the final realization of the trinity or triune mani-\nfestations of God as the One Absolute Spirit—the ever-existing, ever-\nconscious, omnipresent, ever-new Bliss. \nWhile incarnate in his human body, Jesus with his Christ Con-\nsciousness could feel his omnipresence in the entire cosmos and knew \nthat Christ Consciousness to be a reflection of God's Cosmic Con-\nsciousness; but embodiment precluded complete unity with God the \nFather as the transcendental Absolute. After working out through cer-\ntain ecstatic purification rites the remaining seeds of his physical, as-\ntral, and causal incarnate karma in the three days after crucifixion, \nJesus was able to merge his Christ Consciousness with the Cosmic \nConsciousness, or God the Father, the Absolute beyond all delusory \nrelativities of vibratory manifestation. \nThe Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bod-\nies should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day, (for \nthat Sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their \nlegs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. \nThen came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of \nthe other which was crucified with him. \n1490 \n"}

It was the resurrection of the soul into oneness with \nSpirit—the soul's ascension from delusory confinement of body con-\nsciousness into its native immortality and everlasting freedom. Lazarus \nand others whose bodies were raised from the dead by Jesus gained new \nlife, new opportunity for spiritual advancement; but Jesus' resurrection \nlifted his consciousness beyond all relativities of vibratory creation and \nmerged his Self with the transcendental Father, Absolute Spirit. \nAfter attaining oneness with the Absolute, Jesus infused his Spirit-\nexpantled soul back into his crucified body, immortalizing it, and re-\nturned to his bereft disciples in physical form. \nJesus accomplished this ascension in definite steps after his cruci-\nfixion. To Mary Magdalene, who was the first disciple to see him on \nEaster morning, Jesus said: \"Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended \nto my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto \nmy Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\" \nWhy did he tell Mary not to touch him? What did he mean when \nhe said, \"I am not yet ascended to my Father\"? There is deep signifi-\ncance here. Jesus had prophesied that he would rise again after \"three \ndays\" or \"on the third day\" after his crucifixion: \nThree stages of Jesus' \n'\"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise \nascension into Spirit \nit up.'...He spake of the temple of his body.\"* \nafter death \n\"Three days\" means in three periods. Jesus was not \nemphasizing in a literal sense the twenty-four hours \nin each day, but three phases of expression required to liberate his soul \nfrom the physical to the astral plane and then to the spiritual or causal \nplane, and from there to complete mergence in the Cosmic Conscious-\nness of the Father. Many incarnations are required for an unevolved \nsoul to accomplish this. But Jesus knew the process of descent into flesh \nthat had been required for the incarnation on earth of his previously \nliberated soul, and with this knowledge and power he needed simply \nto employ the creative principles that would reverse that process. Thus \nhe would quickly be able to free his soul again from physical, astral, \nand causal limitations by three distinct efforts, and would be able to \nreunite it with the omniscience and omnipotence of the Spirit. \n*John 1:19-21.

Similarly, when Jesus entered mahasamadhi, \na God-realized soul's \nconscious ascension from the physical body at the time of death, he \nmerged his consciousness in the blissful presence of the Cosmic Con-\nsciousness of God the Father and thence returned to his yet-to-be relin-\nquished heavenly garbed astral form. Therein in Christ ecstasy he began \nexpeditiously to unloose, with the supreme soul-science of liberation, the \nknots of life and consciousness that both enabled and resulted from his \nearthly incarnation. \nExpressed succinctly, human nature is an interaction of the three \ngunas or essential creative and motivating qualities of Cosmic Nature, \nidentified in the scriptures of India as sattva, tamas, and \nrajas—the \ngood or elevating mode, the evil or grossening mode, and the activat-\ning mode.* The seeds of one's past actions, actions that were stimu-\nlated by the good, bad, and activating qualities, remain subtly lodged \nin the astral and causal bodies of the physically dead individual.

Otherwise one passes only \nthrough the outermost, golden ring of the spiritual eye and exits the \nmaterial body through the astral center in the medulla oblongata at the \nbase of the skull.

And the vi-\nbrationless infinitude beyond, reached through the star in the spiritual \neye, is the boundless region where Cosmic Consciousness, God the Fa-\nther, dwells. \nIt is impossible with mere intellect to comprehend fully the intri-\ncacies of the astral and causal passageways to liberation and their cor-\nrelation with the spiritual eye.

So Jesus, having unlocked his soul from the physical, astral, \nand causal forms, could not only ascend into Spirit but also come down \nagain and bring a new body with him. Even as God by special creation \nformed the bodies of the first Adam and Eve, so ascended masters, af-\nter they rise above the limiting confines of the three bodies, can create \na body that they had in any incarnation; or can remodel the bodies that \nthey left behind in death, as Jesus' body was, and make them immortal. \nThus Jesus after crucifixion could appear among his disciples for forty \ndays, materializing and dematerializing his form before their eyes. \nRationalizing minds have proposed that when Jesus was crucified \nhe did not actually die, but remained in a temporary state of suspended \nanimation and later revived himself (or was taken from the tomb and \nrevived by his disciples). That is not so. In suspended animation, the soul \ndoes not exit fully from the body; life remains in the spine and the brain, \nsustaining the body, even though breath and heart are completely sus-\npended. When the soul, with its astral and causal bodies, goes away \ncompletely from the cerebrospinal plexuses, withdrawing the guiding in-\ntelligence and life force that empowers the specialized functions of life \nenergy in the bodily cells, then the cells begin to disintegrate and the \nbody begins to decay.* As long as the soul is still in the body, the body \ndoes not decay even when all outwardly observable vital functions cease. \nIt is known that there are various kinds of bodily suspension from \nwhich \"resurrection\" is possible. Sadhu Haridas, for example, as cited \nearlier, was buried forty days in a deathlike trance, and was then disin-\nterred and revived.f But it is nonsense to suggest that Jesus was only in \na state of suspended animation. Spiritually I know that after crucifixion \nJesus completely left his body. His life and consciousness fled not only \nfrom the physical muscles and heart, but also from the spine and brain. \nHe gave up the ghost; soul and life were completely out of that body. \nThe gruesome way that his body was crucified—pierced in many places, \nincluding the heart—made it impossible for the highly organized phys-\niological life to remain in that body. That is why Saint John testified: \n* Cosmic energy in the body works as five specialized currents, empowering the per-\nformance of the crystallizing (prana), assimilating (samana), eliminating (apana), me-\ntabolizing (udana), and circulatory (vyana) activities of the body. \nfSee Discourse 8 for details of story of Sadhu Haridas. \n719 \n"}

And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he \nknoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.\"* \nThe human body is not like a plant, which can be cut in different \npieces, each of which will grow into a plant. In all those parts there is \nlife and intelligence sufficient to generate a new organism. But in the \nhuman body, life is highly centralized in the medulla. From this \"mouth \nof God,\" the specialized life forces needed to maintain the intricately \norganized human body, endowed with intelligence from the supercon-\nsciousness of the indwelling soul, flow out into the body through the \nsubdynamos of the spinal plexuses aided by the subsidiary switchboard \nof the heart. Though in suspended animation life is withdrawn from \nthe heart and other bodily organs, if the medulla or the heart is some-\nhow damaged while the body is in the trance state then life cannot be \nreintroduced, and death ensues. \nIt cannot be physically proved that the soul has gone out of the \nbody unless the body has been destroyed or its vital organs irreparably \ndamaged, or (as mentioned above) decay has started. When decay sets \nin, the soul ordinarily cannot return to that body. But Jesus understood \nthe relation between Cosmic Life and the specialized life in the body. \nThat is why he could revive Lazarus after his disciple's body had been \ndecaying for four days;f and why he could say of himself: \"I lay down \nmy life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay \nit down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to \ntake it again. This commandment have I received of my F a t h e r .

A few think of the beauties of Christmas mu-\nsic and church services. Most celebrators revel in the festivity of the \nChristmas tree, with its glimmering electric \"stars\" and tinsel and the \ngaily wrapped gifts beneath its branches. It is good to celebrate the \nbirth of Christ with songs, dinners, and the exchange of gifts; but if \nmaterial festivity becomes the only purpose of all the Christmas cele-\nbration, it is a pity, and nothing of spiritual value is gained. \nLet us learn how to make our celebration of Christmas a real \ncommemoration of the holy life of Christ, a truly spiritual and uplift-\ning experience. Once I saw a shotgun adorning a Christmas tree, and \nI remarked to my hostess: \"Madam, that gift for your son is an insult \nto the Christ who preached 'Thou shalt not kill.' A gun means death, \nmurder, revenge, brother fighting brother. For that reason it is out of \nplace in the celebration of the birthday of the 'Prince of Peace.'\" The \nlady took the gun away, and placed there instead a beautiful edition \nof a children's Bible. On Christmas Day we should exchange not only \nuseful gifts, but God-reminding gifts as well. \nThe original meaning of religious symbols and holy days is often \nforgotten. Thus, most people think of Christmas as an ordinary holiday \nfestivity and forget Christ, the master of ceremonies. When used only as \nan occasion for festivity, the great spiritual significance of Christmas is \nlost sight of. As in a motion-picture show, the principal attention of the \naudience is on the story and not on the music, so in Christmas enter-\n1529 \n"}

Indif-\nferent, unconscious honor shown to him will not do us any good. \nChristmas should be so observed that it may materially, mentally, and \nspiritually give us, at the least, a new impetus to start in the Christ-\npath of truth with the beginning of the new year. \nWe did this last year [1931] at the Self-Realization Fellowship \nMother Center. A short description of the way we observed Christmas \nwill give some suggestions as to how spiritual people should celebrate \nthe coming Christmas. \nTo begin with, we did our Christmas shopping early. Every resi-\ndent, and all others invited to the Christmas festivity, received a gift. \nHowever small in monetary value, it was rich with our love. Everyone \nin our divine family is considered close to us because of a spiritual tie, \nwhich is even stronger than a material tie of compulsion. We are gath-\nered together in the name of our One Father, and have recognized our-\nselves as His children made in His image. \nWe knew that getting dinner for a hundred people, adorning the \nChristmas tree, and making all the arrangements, would take much \ntime, and that in the din of activity Christ might slip away unnoticed \nfrom the altar of our attention. So the day before Christmas we fasted \non fruits and suspended all cooking and other preparations for Christ-\nmas Day. We sat around the exquisitely decorated Christmas tree and \nalternately chanted and meditated deeply, from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. We \nate a supper of fruit and meditated again until 1 1 p.m. As we retired, \nmany guests, with tears in their eyes, said: \"We have felt Christ and \nGod today. We never knew before what the deep diving into Cosmic \nConsciousness meant. Most of us swam on the surface of the sea of \nsilence, but never dived to get the beautiful pearls of God-contact.\" \nChristmas morning we began with a meditation, and then the fi-\nnal preparations were completed and the long-looked-for dinner came. \nAfter that was the opening of the mystery packages, then a closing \nmeditation and singing until late at night. So it was that our Christ-\nmas began in the consciousness of Christ and ended in his Expanded \nConsciousness. \nWith the coming of Christmas, do not let your consciousness sink \ninto the well of turkey dinners, exchange of gifts, dances, festivities, \n1530 \n"}

Then open your eyes, behold your little body, and \nsay: \"The Christ-Bliss is descending on the altar of my thought, feel-\ning, and devotion.\" Meditate upon the affirmation: \"Christ-Peace is \ndescending into every tissue and cell of my body as health.\" \nPlace Christ on the altar of your business and possessions. Say: \"I \npossess these things in Christ.\" Then meditate on the affirmation: \"My \nChrist-Peace has descended upon every member of my family, upon \nmy country, and upon my world.\" Behold Christ-Peace descending \nupon your body, your possessions, and extending to your neighbors, \nto all countries, and onto the united altar of all hearts and all crea-\ntures.

But \nChristmas is far more than a holiday celebration for the masses. For \nme, Christmas has a greater meaning: the consciousness of the signif-\nicance of Christ — an individualistic consciousness wherein I find \nChrist as the Universal Spirit manifesting in my own consciousness. \nThat is what is most important—to bring the actual realization of \nChrist into our observance of Christmas. \nWhen a great personality has come on earth, it is customary for \na special day to be set aside to honor that figure, often in a social or \nmaterial way. If this is the only manner in which one observes the birth \nof Christ, I think it is an insult to him, and is not a proper celebration. \nI have often said that Christ was crucified at the hands of ignorant \npeople not only once, but that he is being crucified all the time by \nthose who do not know the true meaning of the life and teachings of \nChrist. Ignorant people desecrate their souls by nonunderstanding and \ntheir own misguided actions. \nOf course, homage paid to Christ in whatever manner always does \nsome good. Christmas festivity evokes the sentiment of the peace of this \ndivine soul who came into the world to serve as a beacon of light to \nguide stray hearts. There is also the spirit of joy that abounds in tradi-\ntional Christmas observances. Perfect joy, joy that is connected with \npurity, is the joy of God.

Love, the di-\nvine love of God, is the most inspiring truth that Jesus demonstrated; \nit was the power by which he could return love and forgiveness for the \nhatred he received. To express hate for hate is easy and basely human, \nbut to love in the face of enmity and unkindness is greatness. Love is \nthe stronger weapon; it can destroy hatred. The remembrance of the \nexemplary divine goodness of Jesus that was manifested in all he did, \nthe thought of the Divine Love he gave, and that in that Love he lived \nand died to uplift the ^orld—that is the spirit predominant at Christ-\nmastime. All this is what Christmas stands for. \nI give you this talk that you may know the purpose of this our \nChristmas meditation day.

The deeper the meditation, the easier it becomes to perceive \nChrist. Those who are intimidated by the effort required, and hence \ngive up, never get beyond the obstacles of the body and mind. The \ngreatest victory to be achieved is over our own selves; it lies in the con-\nquering of our mental deficiencies and wrong habits. I want you to go \nwith me to the land beyond, where Christ reigns. It is very easy for \nme.

If you were living in this one room all of your life, \nhaving no contact with or knowledge of what is beyond these walls, \nyou would say that this is the whole of your world. But if someone \nwere to take you into the world outside, you would realize how in-\nfinitesimal your \"world\" was. So it is with the perception of Christ \nConsciousness. The scope of mortal consciousness by comparison is \nlike observing only the area of a tiny mustard seed to the exclusion of \nthe rest of the cosmos.^ Christ Consciousness is Omnipresence, the \nLord spread over every pore of infinite space and permeating every \natom. When in deep meditation we peer through the spiritual eye, we \nbehold God's creation-evolving spiritual light afloat in the vast sphere \nof our awakening in Christ. \nLet us today prepare our consciousness to celebrate spiritually the \nbirth of Christ. Let Christ, who is the only pure reflection in creation \nof the Consciousness of God the Father, enter into our consciousness. \nAll those who have attained Christhood can retain the physical \nlikenesses of their incarnations on earth, and they can manifest those \n—— \nforms to their true devotees. If you are not able to \nA vision of Christ \nsee Jesus when you pray to him, it is because you do \nnot really try. If you want to perceive Christ, the \nway is through intensity and perseverance in meditation. Sacrifice sleep, \ndiscipline the body, control the mind; burn the darkness of closed eyes \nwith your meditation. Then you will have Christ with you. As God is \ntrue, your prayer will be answered if you make the right effort. \nMany times I have seen Christ manifested in form. Once in \nBoston, during a very busy period, I suddenly felt that for three days \nI had forgotten God. I was wholly engaged in His work, forgoing sleep \nand everything. So it seemed that by lack of meditation I had left God \nout. This thought was so painful to me that I packed up my belong-\nings and said to Him: \"I am going to walk out of all this activity. It is \nfor You that I am doing all this; yet because of it, I have forgotten \nYou!\" What is the use of having a spiritual organization if God is not \nthere? It is just like preparing a banquet for an honored guest and hav-\ning that person absent from the table. I sat to meditate, and prayed to \nGod: \"I am going now!\" \nHis voice replied: \" N o . \" \n1540 \n"}

My \nmind said: \"Maybe this is a hallucination. If the person who is medi-\ntating here with me sees the vision also, then I will believe.\" At that \nmoment, this person saw the same manifestation that I was perceiv-\ning. The room became filled with a wonderful fragrance that remained \nall day long and was perceptible to everyone who entered the room. \nSuch experiences are not imagination. As you progress on this path \nyou shall see the wonders of God. Sometime during January I shall give \na demonstration of the power of mind over the body. Even as a child, I \nused to show that power; but I gave it up because my desire was for \nGod's love and not His miracles. I show His power only when He has \ngiven me permission to do so. My interest is in spiritual healing, more \nthan in any other kind of healing or phenomenal demonstration. My \nwish is to draw those who love God. I prefer a soul to a crowd, and I \nlove crowds of souls. Many times it seemed that my love's labor was lost, \nbut then I would be amazed to see the development of some sincere stu-\ndents. This I can say: No one who comes to me with an open mind and \nspiritual recipiency shall go away without some perception of God. \nMany lack faith in God unless they receive evidence of His pow-\ners. Faith is very important, because receptivity to divine power is shut \noff by negative thoughts and doubts. Faith grows as \n— \nyou exercise it; and when you have faith, you can \nKnow that God is your \ndo everything. If you can hold on to an idea long \nown \nenough, and do not give up when opposed by con-\ntrary evidence, even if the whole world says it is impossible; if you can \nfight the negative thoughts of people and keep your own thoughts \nstrong while working toward your goal, it will manifest. \nWhen we wish for God, there is nothing we have to create or ac-\nquire. We have Him already. He is with us, buried beneath the debris \nof doubts and unbelief. All you have to do is know that God is your \nown. With material things, you do not own anything; you have to beg \nfor everything you get. Why degrade yourself to the status of a beggar \n1541 \n"}

Do not go on desiring too many things. \nJust say to the Lord: \"I am having a good time participating in Your \ncosmic drama, and I am happy with whatever You send to me.\" That \nis living in the real spirit of Christ. \nAnything you enjoy apart from God is potentially destructive to \nyour true happiness. If the senses are connected with God they will \nserve you; but if they are not settled in God, they will destroy you. To \nremain drunk with materiality is to be tossed about like waves in a \nstorm; but when you are safe on the Divine Shore, then you will see \nall waves of life as a part of the Ocean of God—the Sea of Christ Con-\nsciousness. Ordinary people are buffeted about by the winds of emo-\ntions and desires, unable to see the Infinite Ocean as the essence of \ntheir life and being. Meditation gives you a chance to realize that we \nare all waves of life dancing on the Sea of Christ Consciousness in \nGod. Do not live in ignorance; do not die in delusion. \nI used to pray urgently to God: \"Hours are passing, days and years \nwill go by, but I will not give up until You come to me; I want You, my \nBeloved, only You.\" He came at last, and is always with me now. Noth-\ning can take Him away. It does not matter to me whether the world ac-\ncepts or forsakes me, or whether friends support or leave me. I have \nGod. When He is with you, He makes you fearless, secure in His love. \nThe best time to make love to God is at night when you are free \nand the world is asleep. Take your heart away from everything and \ngive it only to God in deep meditation. I practiced that. Now, no mat-\nter what I am doing, working or meditating, my mind is on God. So \nit must be with you. When you become drunk with God you don't lose \nyour balance even in the midst of troubles and activities. \nNever go to bed until you have made real contact with God. Then \nin the daytime you will be able to conquer all the temptations and de-\nstructive forces that confront you. Nobody can take your peace away \nfrom you. Nothing can take away that divine love between you and \nGod. Be determined! \nThe Lord is waiting to see if perchance we use our God-given free-\ndom to seek Him, our own Beloved. When we do, that pleases Him \nmore than anything else. If instead we use our freedom to cast Him \naway, then He is filled with sorrow. When freely we give our love to \nHim—not because He is great and all-powerful, but because He is our \nown, and because we are His children, expressions of His One Con-\nsciousness—that is what He loves. \n1542 \n"}

Your mind will re-\nmain busy with restless thoughts. As the night wore on, my friend be-\ncame restless because he didn't cross over the trenches that lie in the path \nof meditation. Finally he said, \"Let us go to bed now.\" But I was in joy \nof expectation of the coming of Krishna. I wasn't seeing anything; yet I \nfelt I was on the right track. Six o'clock in the morning came, and my \nfriend again urged, \"Come on, let's go to bed!\" But I returned, \"I shall \nnever give up!\" Just as I said that, fulfillment came. With open eyes I \nsaw Lord Krishna! My friend couldn't see him but he felt the divine \npresence. When I reached out and touched my companion, he also saw \nwhat I saw. My first love—for Krishna—was responded to! \nIf you want to see any particular saint or avatar, you must cultivate \nthe divine consciousness to receive that manifestation. Right here in this \nchapel while I was giving a sermon, Saint Francis of Assisi once came to \nme; and from that experience I wrote the poem, \"God! God! God!\"* \nAnd so I tell you, it is wonderful to live in that all-encompassing Christ \nConsciousness. You must realize Christ in Spirit first, and then you can \nsee Him in form. \nSelf-Realization Fellowship is awakening that divine conscious-\nness in true souls. Those who will meditate and receive Christ in their \nconsciousness, they will be the real saints. \nAnd so on this Christmas meditation day, with adamantine heart \nprepare your mind. In divine perception, everything will melt into the \nsea of Christ Consciousness. To me, everything is One—aflame with \nthe same one consciousness of God. Today meditate so deeply and so \nfervently that you feel Christ, that you know he is real, and not just a \nscriptural idea spread by the intellectual exultation of others.

The worldly minded enjoy their social \nrounds, and drink themselves into oblivion as their way of celebrating \nthe birth of Christ. \nTo the practical-minded, Christmas has also a mercenary side. \nChurches count on the spirit of the season to bring bigger collections \nto support their work; and on the same basis merchants encourage \nspending in anticipation of higher profits. There is nothing wrong in \nusing business methods to advance the spiritual work of Christ to es-\ntablish his ideals in receptive souls; but it is blasphemous to use Christ \nand his ideals merely as a means for increasing business. \nChristmas in many churches means great festivity, and is observed \nwith music, plays, ceremonies, socials, and often extra charitable \nworks.

Most people do not know \nhow to celebrate the coming of Christ on earth: by beholding the di-\nvine Christ Consciousness, which was manifest in Jesus, born anew in \nthe cradle of their own spiritual awakening in deep meditation. \nThe question is, which is right? to observe the birth of the Christ \nJesus with worldly rejoicings expressed in bright decorations, festive \ndinners, and the exchange of gifts; or to worship him in spirit only? \nBirthday celebrations are meant to make the one who is being \nhonored feel that his life is of value to those observing his birth an-\nniversary. Such observances also serve to focus the attention of oth-\ners on qualified souls wl^ose lives are worthy of appreciation and em-\nulation. Jesus does not need our celebrations to gratify and uplift him. \nBut it is right and appropriate that we celebrate his birthday every \nChristmas, because his life is permanently useful and inspiring to all \nhumanity in all ages. We certainly need to celebrate his coming in or-\nder to remind ourselves of his exemplary, abiding, uplifting life, so \nthat perchance our deeper thought of him may encourage us to re-\nmold our lives, and to pattern them through all futurity after his di-\nvine life. \nMillions are planning to celebrate this coming Christmas in their \nusual way, as a purely social event.

From his earliest years, it was clear that his life was marked \nfor a divine destiny. According to those closest to him, even as a child \nthe depth of his spiritual awareness and experience was far beyond the \nordinary. In his youth he sought out many of India's sages and saints, \nhoping to find an illumined teacher to guide him in his spiritual quest. \nIt was in 1 9 1 0 , at the age of seventeen, that he met and became a \ndisciple of the revered Swami Sri Yukteswar. In the hermitage of this \ngreat master, he spent the Better part of the next ten years, receiving \nSri Yukteswar's strict but loving spiritual discipline. After he gradu-\nated from Calcutta University in 1 9 1 5 , his Guru bestowed on him the \nformal vows of a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order, at \nwhich time he received the name Yogananda (signifying bliss, ananda, \nthrough divine union, yoga). \nIn 1 9 1 7 , Sri Yogananda began his life's work with the founding \nof a \"how-to-live\" school for boys, where modern educational meth-\nods were combined with yoga training and instruction in spiritual \nideals. Three years later he was invited to serve as India's delegate to \nan International Congress of Religious Liberals convening in Boston. \nHis address to the Congress, on \"The Science of Religion,\" was en-\nthusiastically received. \nFor the next several years, he lectured and taught on the East \nCoast and in 192.4 embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. To \nthe tens of thousands of Westerners who attended his lectures during \nthe decade that followed, his discourses on the unity of \"the original \nteachings of Jesus Christ and the original Yoga taught by Bhagavan \nKrishna\" were a revelation. The Los Angeles Times reported on Jan-\nuary 28, 1925: \"The Philharmonic Auditorium presents the extraor-\ndinary spectacle of thousands...being turned away an hour before the \nadvertised opening of a lecture with the 3,000-seat hall filled to its ut-\nmost capacity. Swami Yogananda is the attraction. A Hindu invading \nthe United States to bring God in the midst of a Christian community, \npreaching the essence of Christian doctrine.\" \nLater that year, he established in Los Angeles the international head-\nquarters of Self-Realization Fellowship, the society he had founded in \n1920 to disseminate his teachings and perpetuate the work he had begun. \n1566 \n"}

In this enthusiastic \nthrong, there were litterateurs, medical men, leaders of fashion, clergy-\nmen, and indeed followers drawn from many walks of life.

There he had a long-awaited reunion with his guru, \nSwami Sri Yukteswar, who honored him with India's highest religious \ntitle, Paramahansa, bestowed on those deemed to have achieved irrev-\nocable union with God. While in his native land, he traveled and lec-\ntured and met with many spiritual luminaries, including Mahatma \nGandhi, who requested initiation in Kriya Yoga from him. \nReturning to America at the end of 1936, Paramahansaji began \nto withdraw somewhat from his nationwide public lecturing to devote \nhimself to building an enduring foundation for his worldwide work \nand to the writings that would carry his message to future generations. \nHis life story, Autobiography of a Yogi, was published in 1946 and \nsubstantially expanded by him in 1 9 5 1 .

He looked on \nMarch 27 t h as fresh and as unravaged by decay as he had \nlooked on the night of his death.

In his commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Para-\nmahansa Yogananda wrote: \nIn a book available to the general public I cannot give the \ntechniques themselves; for they are sacred, and certain ancient \nspiritual injunctions must first be followed to insure that they \nare received with reverence and confidentiality, and thereafter \npracticed correctly. \nLost to humanity for centuries during the dark ages, Kriya Yoga \nwas revived in modern times by a line of enlightened masters—Maha-\nvatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Swami Sri Yukteswar, and Parama-\nhansa Yogananda. To disseminate the liberating spiritual science \nworldwide through Self-Realization Fellowship was the mission en-\ntrusted to Paramahansa Yogananda by his guru and paramgurus.

The powers of the astral body enliven the \nphysical body, much as electricity illumines a bulb. The astral body has \nnineteen elements: intelligence, ego, feeling, mind (sense consciousness); \nfive instruments of knowledge (the sensory powers within the physical or-\ngans of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch); five instruments of action \n(the executive powers in the physical instruments of procreation, excretion, \nspeech, locomotion, and the exercise of manual skill); and five instruments \nof life force that perform the functions of circulation, metabolization, as-\nsimilation, crystallization, and elimination. \nastral light. The subtle light emanating from lifetrons (see prana); the struc-\ntural essence of the astral world. Through the all-inclusive intuitive per-\nception of the soul, devotees in concentrated states of meditation may per-\nceive the astral light, particularly as the spiritual eye (q.v.). \nastral world.

There he remains for a karmi-\ncally predetermined time until physical rebirth. \nAum (Om). The Sanskrit root word or seed-sound symbolizing that aspect of \nGodhead which creates and sustains all things; Cosmic Vibration.

Even as sound is produced by the vibration of a running mo-\ntor, so the omnipresent sound of Aum faithfully testifies to the running of \nthe \"Cosmic Motor,\" which upholds all life and every particle of creation \nthrough vibratory energy.

The Gita is allegory as well as history, a spiritual dissertation \non the inner battle between man's good and bad tendencies. Depending on \nthe context, Krishna symbolizes the guru, the soul, or God; Arjuna repre-\nsents the aspiring devotee.

In ascending order, |hese chakras are muladhara (the coccygeal, \nat the base of the spine); svadhisthana (the sacral, two inches above mul-\nadhara)-, mattipura (the lumbar, opposite the navel); anahata (the dorsal,\nopposite the heart); vishuddha (the cervical, at the base of the neck); ajna \n(traditionally located between the eyebrows; in actuality, directly con-\nnected by polarity with the medulla; see also medulla and spiritual eye); \nand sahasrara (in the uppermost part of the cerebrum). \nThe seven centers are divinely planned exits or \"trapdoors\" through \nwhich the soul has descended into the body and through which it must \nreascend by a process of meditation. By seven successive steps, the soul es-\ncapes into Cosmic Consciousness. In its conscious upward passage through \nthe seven opened or \"awakened\" cerebrospinal centers, the soul travels the \nhighway to the Infinite, the true path by which the soul must retrace its \ncourse to reunite with God. \nYoga treatises generally consider only the six lower centers as chakras, \nwith sahasrara referred to separately as a seventh center.

Though Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection took place in \nA.D. 30, the first of the four canonical gospels (which most scholars believe \nto be Mark's) was not written until about forty years later. (Early Chris-\ntians considered the Jewish scriptures to be their holy books; and, since \nmany expected the imminent return of Jesus to earth, they apparently felt \nno need for additional written teachings. Though the first epistles, or pas-\ntoral letters, of the Apostle Paul were written around the year 50 or 51, no \nsystematic narrative of Jesus' life and teachings was written until Mark's \nappeared around the year 70.) \nHistorians generally agree that both Matthew and Luke drew from \nMark; and both of them, in addition, had access to material from other \nsources. Scholars attribute further differences in the content and emphasis of \nthe four gospels, which were written at different times between A.D. 70 and \n90, to the particular events and concerns faced by the independent Christian \ncommunities—some of Jewish ancestry, some of Gentile—scattered in differ-\nent regions of the eastern Roman Empire as the movement gradually evolved \nfrom its Jewish roots to a fully separate religion. (The Gospel of Thomas, also \ncited herein, is thought to have been compiled during the same period as the \nfour canonical gospels—within a few decades after Jesus' ascension.) \nRegarding the authors of the four New Testament Gospels, Matthew \nand John, of course, are names of two of the original twelve apostles of \nJesus. Mark, according to Papias, bishop of Hieropolis in Asia Minor (ca. \n130), was the assistant and \"interpreter\" of Jesus' disciple Peter; and wrote \ndown what he heard Peter relate about the sayings and deeds of Jesus. \nLuke is identified in early accounts as the traveling companion of Paul, \nwho had personally known Peter, John, and Jesus' brother James.

The highest step on the Eightfold Path of Yoga, as outlined by the \nsage Patanjali (q.v.). Samadhi is attained when the meditator, the process of \nmeditation (by which the mind is withdrawn from the senses by interior-\nization), and the object of meditation (God) become One. Paramahansa \nYogananda has explained that \"in the initial states of God-communion \n(savikalpa samadhi) the devotee's consciousness merges in the Cosmic \nSpirit; his life force is withdrawn from the body, which appears 'dead,' or \nmotionless and rigid. The yogi is fully aware of his bodily condition of sus-\npended animation. As he progresses to higher spiritual states (nirvikalpa \nsamadhi), however, he communes with God without bodily fixation; and in \nhis ordinary waking consciousness, even in the midst of exacting worldly \nduties.\" Both states are characterized by oneness with the ever new bliss of \nSpirit, but the nirvikalpa state is experienced by only the most highly ad-\nvanced masters. \n1590 \n"}

In deep meditation, as the devotee's consciousness penetrates \nthe spiritual eye, into the three realms epitomized therein, he experiences \nsuccessively the following states: superconsciousness or the ever new joy \nof soul realization, and oneness with God as Aum (q.v.) or Holy Ghost; \nChrist consciousness, oneness with the universal intelligence of God in all \ncreation; and cosmic consciousness, unity with the omnipresence of God \nthat is beyond as well as within vibratory manifestation.

For the West, Sri Yogananda \ntranslated the Indian name as \"Self-Realization Fellowship.\" \nyuga. A cycle or subperiod of creation, outlined in ancient Hindu texts.
